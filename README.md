We gathered modification logs from two large-scale data dumps from [Stack Overflow](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange), accessed in March 2022.
In our dataset,  we identified 122,528 title reformulation threads. From these threads, we extracted a total of 152,259 title reformulation pairs.
We split the dataset into the training set, the validation set, and the testing set in a ratio of 80\%, 10\%, and 10\%.
The details of statistical information for different programming languages can be found in Table.
