"HTML, Javascript, enabling disabled radio buttons"," The following code works great in IE, but not in FF or Safari. I can't for the life of me work out why. The code is supposed to disable radio buttons if you select the ""Disable 2 radio buttons"" option. It should enable the radio buttons if you select the ""Enable both radio buttons"" option. These both work...However, if you don't use your mouse to move between the 2 options (""Enable..."" and ""Disable..."") then the radio buttons do not appear to be disabled or enabled correctly, until you click anywhere else on the page (not on the radio buttons themselves).If anyone has time/is curious/feeling helpful, please paste the code below into an html page and load it up in a browser. It works great in IE, but the problem manifests itself in FF (3 in my case) and Safari, all on Windows XP.  <code>  function SetLocationOptions() { var frmTemp = document.frm; var selTemp = frmTemp.user; if (selTemp.selectedIndex >= 0) { var myOpt = selTemp.options[selTemp.selectedIndex]; if (myOpt.attributes[0].nodeValue == '1') { frmTemp.transfer_to[0].disabled = true; frmTemp.transfer_to[1].disabled = true; frmTemp.transfer_to[2].checked = true; } else { frmTemp.transfer_to[0].disabled = false; frmTemp.transfer_to[1].disabled = false; } }} <form name=""frm"" action=""coopfunds_transfer_request.asp"" method=""post""> <select name=""user"" onchange=""javascript: SetLocationOptions()""> <option value="""" />Choose One <option value=""58"" user_is_tsm=""0"" />Enable both radio buttons <option value=""157"" user_is_tsm=""1"" />Disable 2 radio buttons </select> <br /><br /> <input type=""radio"" name=""transfer_to"" value=""fund_amount1"" />Premium&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <input type=""radio"" name=""transfer_to"" value=""fund_amount2"" />Other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <input type=""radio"" name=""transfer_to"" value=""both"" CHECKED />Both <br /><br /> <input type=""button"" class=""buttonStyle"" value=""Submit Request"" /></form>",How can I enable disabled radio buttons?

What I have works for addresses that end in a slash. I can't find a way to handle addresses that don't end a slash.What seems like it should work is: But the second line causes a 500 server error. If I add a single letter x to the second line: It starts to work, but only for directory names that end in an x. I have tried replacing the x with many different things. Anything more complicated than real characters (like [^x] or .+) gives a 500 server error.And, to satisfy my own curiosity, does anyone know why the addition of a single real letter makes the difference between a server error and a perfectly functioning rule?[Accepted Answer] Thanks to Gumbo I was able to approximate a solution using rewritecond: This works, but filters more than just .html -- it could block other pages. Unfortunately, results in a server error: Request exceeded the limit of 10 internal redirects due to probable configuration error. Use 'LimitInternalRecursion' to increase the limit if necessary.I'd still like to know why: results in a loop. The first half is supposed to check if it doesn't end in .html. Since the second half adds .html, it seems like the functional equivalent of: Obviously I'm missing something. <code>  rewriterule ^(.*)/$ $1/index.html [L] /* addresses ending in / */rewriterule ^(.*(?!html))$ $1/index.html [L] /* where the problem is */ rewriterule ^(.*)/$ $1/index.html [L]rewriterule ^(.*x(?!html))$ $1/index.html [L] rewritecond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.[^/]+$rewriterule (.+) $1/index.html [L] rewritecond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html$ rewriterule ^(.*(?!html))$ $1/index.html [L] while(substr($address,-4)!='html') $address.='html'",Rewriteengine in .htaccess to catch files not ending in html

Java Applet z-index problem; Safari and beyond," A well known problem with Java Applets in webpages is that browsers ignore the z-index of the applet tag vs. other components in the page. No matter how you position and z-index elements in the page, applets will draw themselves on top of everything.There is a workaround, known as the iframe shim, as described here: http://www.oratransplant.nl/2007/10/26/using-iframe-shim-to-partly-cover-a-java-applet/.However, this workaround does not work in Safari 3 or 4 in Windows (assuming the same for Mac).Does anyone know a way to make it work in Safari? Does anyone have ideas about how to pressure Sun to fix the underlying problem so we can avoid clumsy shims? Here is a bug report on the issue, http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6646289, notice that it has been open for a year, however other bug reports go back many many years.This is so frustrating, don't Sun understand that this is the very sort of thing that has marginalized Java as a way of doing cool stuff in the browser?

Why is XML and HTML hard to parse with a regex?," One mistake I see people making over and over again is trying to parse XML or HTML with a regex. Here are a few of the reasons parsing XML and HTML is hard:People want to treat a file as a sequence of lines, but this is valid: People want to treat < or <tag as the start of a tag, but stuff like this exists in the wild: People often want to match starting tags to ending tags, but XML and HTML allow tags to contain themselves (which traditional regexes cannot handle at all): People often want to match against the content of a document (such as the famous ""find all phone numbers on a given page"" problem), but the data may be marked up (even if it appears to be normal when viewed): Comments may contain poorly formatted or incomplete tags: What other gotchas are you aware of? <code>  <tagattr=""5""/> <img src=""imgtag.gif"" alt=""<img>"" /> <span id=""outer""><span id=""inner"">foo</span></span> <span class=""phonenum"">(<span class=""area code"">703</span>)<span class=""prefix"">348</span>-<span class=""linenum"">3020</span></span> <a href=""foo"">foo</a><!-- FIXME: <a href=""--><a href=""bar"">bar</a>",Can you provide some examples of why it is hard to parse XML and HTML with a regex?

Web repeating background image - size vs speed," I was wondering if anyone has done any tests with background images. We normally create a background that repeats at least in one direction (x or y or both).ExampleLet's say we have a gradient background that repeats in X direction. Gradient height is 400px. We have several possibilities. We can create as small image as possible (1 pixel width and 400 pixels high) or we can create a larger image with 400 pixels height.ObservationSince gradient is 400 pixels high we probably won't choose GIF format, because it can only store 256 adaptive colours. Maybe that's enaough if our gradient is subtle, since it doesn't have that many, but otherwise we'll probably rather store image as a 24-bit PNG image to preserve complete gradient detail.DilemmaShould we create an image of 1400 px size that will be repeated n times horizontally or should we create an image of 100400 px size to speed up rendering in the browser and have a larger image file size.So. Image size vs. rendering speed? Which one wins? Anyone cares to test this?

Semantic html5. Back to the 90s ?," I am taking a peek at Dive Into HTML5. It seems nice and interesting, but I am puzzled.In the 1990s, at the time when Netscape was the browser and HTML was HTML2 or HTML3, there were a lot of tags: address, cite, code... Most of them are unused as of today, probably even obsolete. HTML5 introduces tags to express ""semantic meaning"" to the tag itself. This is all fun and games, but I see something very strange in this approach. Technically, the semantics can be very open ended. HTML5 has tags for article, time, navigation bars, footer. Why shouldn't it contain tags for post icon, author's place, name and surname, or whatever else you want to assign specific semantics to (I'm confident <rant> and <nsfw> would be very important tags): ? I thought XML was the strategy to assign semantics to stuff. Nothing forbids you to put an XML chunk under a XHTML div element, and assign a stylesheet to it so to style it properly, or to delegate to the proper viewer the handling of that namespace (for example, when handling RSS or SVG).In conclusion, I don't understand the reason behind this extensions focused towards semantics, when it's clear that semantic is a very broad topic, which is guaranteed to require a potentially infinite amount of semantic tags. Since I am pretty sure there are clever people at W3C, I think I'm wrong, but I'd like to know why. <code> ",Is semantic markup too open-ended?
Semantic HTML5. Back to the 1990s?," I am taking a peek at Dive Into HTML5. It seems nice and interesting, but I am puzzled.In the 1990s, at the time when Netscape was the browser and HTML was HTML2 or HTML3, there were a lot of tags: address, cite, code... Most of them are unused as of today, probably even obsolete. HTML5 introduces tags to express ""semantic meaning"" to the tag itself. This is all fun and games, but I see something very strange in this approach. Technically, the semantics can be very open ended. HTML5 has tags for article, time, navigation bars, footer.

Why do the major browsers not support HTMLs ACCEPT attribute for INPUT tags?," Does anyone know how to use the accept attribute in input tags? I can see it documented, but w3schools indicates that it is not supported by any of the major browsers. Testing also confirms this.I know that validation should be done server-side, and am doing that now. But it'd be nice to have it restrict the types of files in the file upload dialog for usability.Edit: I am fully aware of the security implications of client-side only validation.

How to tell if an iframe is rendered above or below the fold?," I control an iframe being rendered on another domain. Is there a clear way of telling whether this iframe is being rendered above or below the fold on the parent page? Obviously, I can't access the parent DOM because of the same origin policy restriction.For example, I tried measuring the speed of rendering on a canvas or VML tag, hoping it would be faster when the tag isn't on screen. This didn't work - there was no discernable speed difference. Ditto for DOM manipulation - there doesn't seem to be a way to differentiate between reflow/repaint operations below or above the fold.What about flash? I don't have much experience, but could one check how quickly a browser renders flash operations? Or does flash have any 'onvisible' events outside of the DOM standard? <code> ",What optimizations does a browser perform when a DOM element is being rendered off screen?

Google App Engine - Caching generated HTML ," I have written a Google App Engine application that programatically generates a bunch of HTML code that is really the same output for each user who logs into my system, and I know that this is going to be in-efficient when the code goes into production. So, I am trying to figure out the best way to cache the generated pages. The most probable option is to generate the pages and write them into the database, and then check the time of the database put operation for a given page against the time that the code was last updated. Then, if the code is newer than the last put to the database (for a particular HTML request), new HTML will be generated and served, and cached to the database. If the code is older than the last put to the database, then I will just get the HTML direct from the database and serve it (therefore avoiding all the CPU wastage of generating the HTML). I am not only looking to minimize load times, but to minimize CPU usage.However, one issue that I am having is that I can't figure out how to programatically check when the version of code uploaded to the app engine was updated. I am open to any suggestions on this approach, or other approaches for caching generated html.Note that while memcache could help in this situation, I believe that it is not the final solution since I really only need to re-generate html when the code is updated (as opposed to every time the memcache expires). <code> ",Google App Engine - Caching generated HTML

"If you're not supposed to use Regular Expressions to parse HTML, then how are HTML parsers written?"," I see questions every day asking how to parse or extract something from some HTML string and the first answer/comment is always ""Don't use RegEx to parse HTML, lest you feel the wrath!"" (that last part is sometimes omitted).This is rather confusing for me, I always thought that in general, the best way to parse any complicated string is to use a regular expression. So how does a HTML parser work? Doesn't it use regular expressions to parse.One particular argument for using a regular expression is that there's not always a parsing alternative (such as JavaScript, where DOMDocument isn't a universally available option). jQuery, for instance, seems to manage just fine using a regex to convert a HTML string to DOM nodes.Not sure whether or not to CW this, it's a genuine question that I want to be answered and not really intended to be a discussion thread. <code> ",How do HTML parses work if they're not using regexp?

How can I take the first 100 characters of html content ( without stripping the TAGS! )," There are lots of questions on how to strip html tags, but not many on functions/methods to close them.Here's the situation. I have a 500 character Message summary ( which includes html tags ), but I only want the first 100 characters. Problem is if I truncate the message, it could be in the middle of an html tag... which messes up stuff.Assuming the html is something like this: How would I take the first ~100 characters or so? ( Although, ideally that would be the first approximately 100 characters of ""CONTENT"" ( in between the html tags )I'm assuming the best way to do this would be a recursive algorithm that keeps track of the html tags and appends any tags that would be truncated, but that may not be the best approach.My first thoughts are using recursion to count nested tags, and when we reach 100 characters, look for the next ""<"" and then use recursion to write the closing html tags needed from there.The reason for doing this is to make a short summary of existing articles without requiring the user to go back and provide summaries for all the articles. I want to keep the html formatting, if possible.NOTE: Please ignore that the html isn't totally semantic. This is what I have to deal with from my WYSIWYG.EDIT:I added a potential solution ( that seems to work ) I figure others will run into this problem as well. I'm not sure it's the best... and it's probably not totally robust ( in fact, I know it isn't ), but I'd appreciate any feedback <code>  <div class=""bd"">""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. <br/> <br/>Some Dates: April 30 - May 2, 2010 <br/> <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. <em>Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit</em> in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

HTML - Correct way of coding a checkbox with a Label.," I've been using formtastic in order to generate HTML forms on rails applications. My question, however, is really HTML-related.Today I found a strange behaviour on the way formtastic generates checkboxes (fields of type :boolean on formtastic lingo).The rest of the fields (non-checkboxes) are generated this way: Checkboxes, however, are enclosed inside their <label> tags completely - like this: Formtastic philosophy seems to be based on the Learning to Love Forms presentation. In effect, on slide 36 of that presentation this structure is suggested for checkboxes. I guess in the presentation itself the presenter explained why this was done, but it is not written on the slides.Can anyone tell me why enclosing checkboxes inside their <label> tag might be a good idea, as opposed to putting them outside, like with textboxes? <code>  <li> <label for=""my_textbox_field"">My TextBox</label> <input id=""my_textbox_field"" type=""text"" ... ></li> <li> <label for=""my_boolean_field""> <input id=""my_boolean_field"" type=""checkbox"" ... > This is my boolean field </label></li>",HTML - Correct way of coding a checkbox with a Label

"""Disabling"" an HTML table with javascript"," I've seen this done in a lot of sites recently, but can't seem to track one down. Essentially I want to ""disable"" an entire panel (that's in the form on an HTML table) when a button is clicked.By disable I mean I don't want the form elements within the table to be usable and I want the table to sort of fade out.I've been able to accomplish this by putting a ""veil"" over the table with an absolutely positioned div that has a white background with a low opacity (so you can see the table behind it, but can't click anything because the div is in front of it). This also adds the faded effect that I want. However, when I set the height of the veil to 100% it only goes to the size of my screen (not including the scrolling), so if a user scrolls up or down, they see the edge of the veil and that's not pretty.I'm assuming this is typically done in a different fashion. Does anyone have some suggestions as a better way to accomplish this? <code> ","""Disabling"" an HTML table with Javascript"

HTML5 iPhone dynamic caching images," We are building web applications for the iPhone that work offline. But we are having difficulties caching dynamic images. Please read on and I'll show by example exactly what I mean and what we have done so far.So for example let's say we are building a simple list application with just 1 page. The application's only purpose is to list 5 items, each item containing some text and 1 image.The application has a simple logo and some separate JavaScript and CSS code. These static resources are cached using the cache manifest file.There are 2 scenario's:Scenario 1: I'm online and I open up the web applicationWhen I load the list application in Safari it will fetch 5 new random items out of a database containing 1000's of items. These are all served by simple backend through a AJAX call (JSON format).The whole JSON object containing the 5 items is immediately stored in HTML5 local storage and cached for offline usage.Structure of the JSON object is a bit like this: As you can see, very simple (may be some errors in that JSON), the whole JSON object is stored in local storage.Now the 5 items are rendered using JavaScript injected HTML (styled using CSS), nothing fancy. Span tags containing the text and image tags pointing to the image resource are created etc.In online mode, it all works great.Scenario 2: I'm OFFLINE and I open up the web applicationThe page loads (the logo is displayed because it was cached as a static resource using the cache manifest), some JavaScript detects that we are indeed offline and the application as a result does not attempt to contact the backend. Instead it reads the previously stored JSON object from local storage and commences rendering the 5 items. All as anticipated.Text is displayed fine, but this time, the images are not displayed, reason for that is simple, the image tags are pointing to image resources which are not available. So it displays that little image not available icon.Now my question is, is there any way to cache those image resources somehow? So that next time we need them, they are fetched from cache.This is what I've tried:Base64 encode the images and supply them through JSON. This works BUT, it dramatically increases both fetching and rendering time (we are talking about 30 seconds increase, very slow)Some cache manifest hacking/trial and error.. couldn't find anything that works (ideally need a policy that does 'cache all resources on domain as they are requested', but to my knowledge this does not exist)I have literally spent hours on this and can't find a solution... does anyone have a clue? I know this is possible because if you look at the Google Mail HTML5 application for the iPhone, they can somehow cache the attachments and you can retrieve them even while offline.The one thing we haven't tried is using the SQLite databases that are supported by Safari... maybe I could store the images as a BLOB (still means fetching it from the feed and thus slow?) and then somehow magically converting that into an image on the screen.... but I have no idea on how to do this.Any help is appreciated, thanks. <code>  { ""0"" : { id: ""3"", text: ""Some text about item #3"", image_url: ""http://www.domain.com/image22341.png"" }, ""1"" : { id: ""23"", text: ""Some text about item #23"", image_url: ""http://www.domain.com/image442321.png"" }, ""2"" : { id: ""4"", text: ""Some text about item #4"", image_url: ""http://www.domain.com/image2321.png"" }, ""3"" : { id: ""432"", text: ""Some text about item #432"", image_url: ""http://www.domain.com/image2441.png"" }, ""4"" : { id: ""43"", text: ""Some text about item #43"", image_url: ""http://www.domain.com/image221.png"" }}",HTML5 iPhone dynamic caching of images

So I want to create a browser-based interactive realitme animation of the Earth and the other planets going around the Sun...where do I start?," I would like to create a browser based, interactive, realtime animation, showing the Earth as it goes around the sun, depending on the time of day and time of year. This animation should also (eventually) show the other planets in the solar system and the user should be able to pan around the solar system and see it from different sides (by click-drag, scroll etc.).I wouldn't think it has any real practical application, but I like the artistic value found in the universe...so it would be interesting to start doing it and I'll probably learn a few things while doing this.I don't have any experience with planetary physics, although I'd probably understand it if given a good source of information. I do have some experience with web development, with languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python.Now, questions: Most importantly, how would I begin aproject such as this?Where do I get the information aboutthe rotation of the Earth and theother planets in the solar system?What languages should I use/learn?What other thoughts do you have aboutthis idea? What functionality do youthink would be interesting for aproject such as this?This idea is very much impulse driven, especially at this late hour of the day...as I'm looking out the window and seeing the buildings getting darker and darker, I'm also imagining how the Earth is slowly spinning around itself and also around the Sun and I think it would be a very nice sight to be able to see this from an outside perspective.Hope to get some feedback.

Reverting jquery animations back to original states," I've got a page of elements, each of which, depending on user interaction, may be animated away by the given function: I want to create a reset function that brings all the elements back onto the page. Running all the elements through the toggle function above won't work, because currently hidden elements will be shown, and currently shown elements will be hidden. Essentially looking for way to revert all elements to their original css states, regardless of whether they've been acted upon by jquery animation.Thanks- Edit:Just realized all I need to do is replace 'toggle' with 'show': Calling this on any element will ensure the element is reverted back to visible in this case. However, see Nick's answer below for a more generally applicable approach.  <code>  function slideAndFade(id){ $(id).animate({opacity: 'toggle', width: 'toggle'}, 500);} function revertSlideAndFade(id){ $(id).animate({opacity: 'show', width: 'show'}, 500);}",Reverting jquery animations back to original css states

CSS: How to define a centered height div with endless vertical borders left and right and an initial height of 100%?," First question on SOF, please be gentle if this may be a stupid question. :)Haven't found a solution, neither here nor on the web.I got some trouble with CSS. I pasted my code at the end of this post but first Ill explain what I'm trying to accomplish:I want to build a centered fixed-width content area with endless vertical graphical borders to the left and right.This is what I tried:I created a #content div with a .wrapper div inside. Standard procedure to center a div Id say. Gave the #content the background property for the left border and the .wrapper div the right background.#content works fine: endless left border.But .wrapper stays the same height as its content. So if there is less content then the browser-height the border won't be endless.If I set the content heights to 100% the borders show till the bottom of the page, but if the content is higher then the browser height and I scroll down the borders don't continue.I inserted another div between #content and .wrapper: #contentbr and gave that div the same propertys as #content but with the right border graphic: Won't work, the height stays the same as the content of the wrapper.Tried some more minor tweaks but neither worked out the way I want it.Sad thing is: Nr. 2 works fine if I set the background property of #content to this:_background: url(img/content_left.png) top left repeat-y, url(img/content_left.png) top right repeat-y;_Sadly the IE doesn't know CSS 3 so this is no solution as I can't ignore the IE.. :(So im hoping for some help of you guys.

"HTML 5 Geolocation , How it works", Chrome and Firefox have HTML Geolocation implemented.My question is: how does it work? Do they have a Database locally and get the information from the provider then try to match it?Where is the DB stored ?Can it be accessed ?Update1: the only downside to geolocation is the browser has to ask the user for permission and this is really a bad thing for usability. I understand the security issue but still I don't see how this will become a popular solution.Update2 : Firefox is using a Google WebService to detect the location. Now this seems very strange considering they are competitors now. Also this behavior it's really unexpected for me... I hopped each browser will have it's on (maybe offline) solution.Update3 : So the browsers actually sniff for routers using your wireless network card?Update4 : In the end what informations is the browser sending to the the google webservice ? The detected SSID seems ok ( and it makes sense that if they are tracked by google based on their physical position to make a lookup in the database for matching informations ) but how does it work so well in country where google didn't scanned this ? The other info your browser is sending is your ip but this is not enough to pin point your exact location right ? Regarding other browsers that might implement this. How should they do it ? The api is not documented only the old deprecated GEAR api gives some clue. So this is not really public. <code> ,How does HTML5 Geolocation Work?

I've stried scrolling to the form itself and to the textarea. Same results.Is there a way to scroll to an element only if its not already visible?I've tried many solutions offered on SO, like Scroll to an element using jQuery, but none seem to behave as desired; even Scroll to a particular element w/ jQuery or Check if element is visible after scrolling displays the same ""jumpy"" behaviour.UPDATE: Online demo to show behaviourI've uploaded an html demo page that shows the behaviour I'm complaining about: http://www.wouldbebetter.com/demo/comment-demo.htmJust scroll to the bottom of the page and click any of the Reply links to see the ""jumpy"" scrolling I'm referring to.Note that this demo uses the scrollintoview plugin of @Robert Koritnik's answer, but the behaviour is the same if I use, for instance, ScrollTo. <code>  $.scrollTo($('#addReply_1'), 800);",Scroll to element only if not in view - jQuery

jquery-pjax vs history.js to load a specific content when clicked," I need to ajaxify my site, like loading a spinner or something for rendering specific content in a page when clicking a link.I have found 2 good jQuery plugins.https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjaxhttps://github.com/browserstate/history.jsWhat is their main difference? It seems they are doing the same job. Well, maybe one uses the ajax then returns the html (pjax) and one uses a so-called html5 push state or something.Is there another way doing this? (simpler or with only jQuery) I think it's too overkill to use either of those plugins (but I'm not sure if there is a simpler way for doing this). <code> ",jQuery-pjax vs history.js to load specific content when clicked

Get the response of a cross-domain file upload," It is possible! Read below.First of all, let me use this diagram to explain how asynchronous file uploads can be achieved:Sorry. I've shut down one of my domains, and the image is gone now. It was a really nice image though. This was before I found out that Stack Overflow enables uploading images via Imgur. As you can see, the trick is to let the HTTP-response load into a hidden IFRAME element instead of the page itself. (This is done by setting the target property of the FORM element when submitting the FORM with JavaScript.)This works. However, the problem I'm facing is that the server-side script is on a different domain. The FORM-submit is a cross-domain HTTP-request. Now, the server-side script has CORS enabled which gives my web-page the rights to read the response-data of HTTP-requests made from my page to that script - but that works only if I receive the HTTP-response via Ajax, ergo, JavaScript.However, int this case, the response is directed towards the IFRAME element. And once the XML response lands into the IFRAME, its URL will be the remove script - e.g. http://remote-domain.com/script.pl.Unfortunately, CORS does not cover this case (at least I think) - I am not able to read the contents of the IFRAME since its URL doesn't match the URL of the page (different domain). I get this error: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL hxxp://remote-domain.com/script.pl from frame with URL hxxp://my-domain.com/outer.html.

How can I proportionally scale images to max-width in a UIWebView?," In a UIWebView, I am using the CSS max-width property to scale images of unknown size to fill a space no larger than (but perhaps smaller than) 300 pixels wide.

Prevent browser converting '\n' between lines into space (for Chinese characters)," Converting newline into space makes sense for English, for example, the following HTML: We get the following after converting the newline into space in the browser: This is good for English, but not good for Chinese characters because we don't use spaces to separate words in Chinese. Here's an example (The Chinese sentence has the same meaning of ""This is a sentence""): I get the following result on Chrome, Safari and IE... ...but what I wanted is the following, without the extra space: I don't know why the browser does not ignore the newline if the last character of the current line and the first character of the next line are both Chinese characters (which I think makes more sense). Or they have provided this mechanism but need special handling?BTW, in Vim, when using ""J"" to join lines, no space will be added if the last and the first character of the 2 lines are all Chinese characters. But for English, a space will be added. So I guess Vim does some special handling for this.UPDATE:Though I think this is an issue with the browser, I have to live with that. So currently I would preprocess my Markdown text to join Chinese lines before generating HTML. Here's how I do this in Ruby, complete code which also handles Chinese punctuations is on gist <code>  <p>This isa sentence.</p> This is a sentence. <p></p> #encoding: UTF-8# Requires ruby 1.9.x, and assume using UTF-8 encodingclass String # The regular expression trick to match CJK characters comes from # http://stackoverflow.com/a/4681577/306935 def join_chinese gsub(/(\p{Han})\n(\p{Han})/m, '\1\2') endend",Prevent/workaround browser converting '\n' between lines into space (for Chinese characters)

Python - Selenium WebDriver - Checking element exists," I have a problem - I am using the selenium (firefox) web driver to open a webpage, click a few links etc. then capture a screenshot.My script runs fine from the CLI, but when run via a cronjob it is not getting past the first find_element() test. I need to add some debug, or something to help me figure out why it is failing.Basically, I have to click a 'log in' anchor before going to the login page. The construct of the element is: I am using the find_element By LINK_TEXT method: I am a bit of a Python Noob, so I am battling with the language a bit...A) How do I check that the link is actually being picked up by python? Should I use try/catch block?B) Is there a better/more reliable way to locate the DOM element than by LINK_TEXT? E.g. In JQuery, you can use a more specific selector $('a.lnk:contains(log in)').do_something();I have solved the main problem and it was just finger trouble - I was calling the script with incorrect parameters - Simple mistake.I'd still like some pointers on how to check whether an element exists. Also, an example/explanation of implicit / explicit Waits instead of using a crappy time.sleep() call.

"Javascript - head, body or jQuery?"," This question is just to clear some things up. Some things like this have been asked before, and this rounds them all up into one question - where should JavaScript go in the HTML document, or, more importantly, does it matter? So, one of the things I'm asking is, does at all differ (in terms of functionality) from More importantly, I want to focus on JS that modifies or uses elements from the DOM in any way. So I know that if you put something like document.getElementById(""test"").innerHTML = ""Hello world!"" before <element id=""test""></element> in your body, then it won't work since the body is loaded from top to bottom, making the JS load first, which will then proceed to try to manipulate an element that doesn't exist yet. So it should, just like the above, either go in the <head> or just before the </body> tag. The question is, aside from organisation and sorting, does it matter which one of these is chosen, and if so, in what way?Of course, there is also a third method - the jQuery way: That way, it doesn't matter where in the body you place the code, since it will only be executed when everything has loaded. The question here is, is it worth importing a huge JS library just to use a method the need for which could be replaced with an accurate placing of your scripts? I'd just like to clear things up a little here, if you would like to answer, go ahead! Summary: where should different kinds of scripts go - head or body, and/or does it matter? Is jQuery worth it just for the ready event? <code>  <head><script type=""text/javascript"">alert(""Hello world!"");</script></head> <body><!-- Code goes here --><script type=""text/javascript"">alert(""Hello world!"");</script></body> $(document).ready(function(){ /*Code goes here*/ });","JavaScript - head, body or jQuery?"

How does this HTML5 screencast animation work?," I visited http://www.sublimetext.com today and was intrigued by the screencast animation the website has on its opening page. It looks like a mashup between video and slideshow. I've seen them at other modern websites as well, but I assumed it was some HTML5 video tag trickery. But when I looked at the source of sublimetext webpage, I was confused.The animation on this page is created on a HTML5 2D canvas with plain javascript using base PNG images. Each slide is loaded from a PNG file. The animation is achieved by modifying only handful of pixels from the image. The animation javascript applied these changes on the original PNGs at regular intervals. You will find these deltas stored in *_timeline variables in the script.My question is what tool can generate such deltas? How can one record one's desktop screen and create such base PNG + animation deltas?I like this approach because it seems most efficient format for screencasts, where changes in consecutive frames are minimal.Update 1 I know there are techniques to achieve this using GIF (Check https://askubuntu.com/q/107726), but what cool tool can generate this javascript code that can convert PNG deltas to animation. Googling hasn't helped me find it out.Update 2 The author of the screencast (and sublimetext) replied to my question on sublimetext forum.

fixed div and dynamic sized div," i am trying to implement a content where i need to have a section of 100% of the browser width and inside it i need to have in the left size a div with 200px width and in it's right i need to have a div with dynamic width depending of the browser width.Example .. browser = 900px -> left div 200px right div 700px.And both of the divs have dynamic height depending how much info i put in them .. the wrapper div will take the biggest of those 2 div height..So far i did something like this html css Now i need to css the #list and #grid divs. I hope there is an efficient solution to this because later on i will have the same stuff to do inside the #grid div :)Thank you in advance, Daniel! <code>  <section id=""wrapper""> <div id=""list""> </div> <div id=""grid""> </div></section> #wrapper { width: 100%; min-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 40px 0; overflow: hidden;}","Two columns, left with fixed width, right with dynamic width"
"Use method=""post"" for multiple language selection"," I'm building a website that has dual languages with two flags as an entry page. I'm planning on using <form method=""post""> around the flags so the user can select the language they want.Then on the following pages I want to use something like: So on clicking the flag, they have selected the language they want. Will that only work on the next page after they have clicked the flag or can they carry on navigating to different pages and it still pick up what language was selected?If that doesn't work, how else can it be done?UPDATE:I don't think I made it clear before that I'm using Wordpress, which apparently doesn't like $_SESSION.I have this on a template called region.php to submit the language selection: What do I need to put on every other template to check what language was selected? To help with the example if UK has been selected then it can just echo ""UK"", if the rest of the world was selected then it can just show ""World"".This needs to work across several pages so if they goto the about page it checks the language, then if they navigate to the contact page it checks the language again - all that has to come from the initial language selection. <code>  <?phpif( $_POST['language']=='uk' ){ echo $uk;}elseif( $_POST['language']=='french' ){ echo $french;}?> <form action=""<?php the_permalink(); ?>/home"" name=""region"" method=""post""> <div id=""uk""> <a href=""javascript:document.region.submit()"" name=""UK""> <img style=""margin-bottom:10px;"" src=""<?php bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?>/images/-uk.png"" width=""259"" height=""160"" alt=""UK"" /> </a> <h1 style=""color:black!IMPORTANT;"">Enter United Kingdom site</h1> </div> <div id=""world""> <a href=""javascript:document.region.submit()"" name=""World""> <img style=""margin-bottom:10px;"" src=""<?php bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?>/images/world.png"" width=""258"" height=""160"" alt=""Rest of the World"" /> </a> <h1 style=""color:black!IMPORTANT;"">Enter Rest of the World site</h1> </div> </form>","Wordpress: Use method=""post"" for multiple language selection"
Should I use px or rem in my css?," I am designing a new website and I want it to be compatible with as much browsers and browser settings as possible.

Form value creates a url, I am trying to create a very simple form with a little bit of extra code to get the results as described below: the problem is I don't know how to go about doing it.What I am trying to achieve:I have a form which has one text input box with the name 'url'. I want the user to be able to input a number into the box. When the user submits the form they should be redirected to a new website. The new website's URL will be based on the number inputted into the form.The first part of the URL will always be: http://name.com/Then the number that the user inputted will be attached to the end. So if 123456 is entered into the form then on submission of the form the user would be taken to http://name.com/123456How can I get this working? I am guessing it will require JavaScript or something. <code> ,Form value creates a URL

But in the meantime how do I best repair the damage that's being done?I can't add either the original href or something like href=""#"" back to the links as the third party code will no longer do what it does.

CSS Diamond Shape centric website," I've got an audacious project and would like some advice. I want to have a site that uses CSS Diamonds, I've attached an image to give a better idea of what I am looking at doing. Here are the issues I have run into so far:The triangles are perfectly aligned until a submenu is added, then the right three shift to the right (this was working at one point). Also the li in which the submenu is under loses its diamondThe text on the submenu diamonds are not centered.I cannot have the background image, then diamond then title. I have tried different z-indexs and it hasn't worked. (To see the menu titles, the background image needs to be removed, and the diamonds need to be -1 z-indexed)Because I need to use spans to create the triangle text wrapping for the sidebar I cannot just make the sidebar div a diamond, so I still need to add the diamond in below it.It would be great to have both the right text body and the sidebar text body wrap to the diamond, however I think this is not possible, therefore I reverted to just having the sidebar wrap.Here is my HTML so far: I have commented out the submenu and my sidebar diamond attempt. http://jsfiddle.net/s4XXE/  <code>  /* reset.css */ html { margin: 0;

Can typescript be used in conjunction with PhoneGap (or similar)?," So I just learned about TypeScript - hurrah! I'm so happy I can finally join the HTML5 party. My Object Oriented brain is just not compatible with JavaScript ... However, I immediately wondered if TypeScript actually helps people like me. Sure, I can write JavaScript compatible software with a nice C# style syntax with interfaces & classes, but can it actually be used on anything other than browser apps?

Should we be setting width on #wrapper <div> or the <body>?," A lot of people's HTML markup looks like this: And most of the time in examples here, or on the web, people suggest that you should apply width settings to the #wrapper, instead of the <body>.Is there an underlying reason for that?For example, in an article on techniques for gracefully degrading media queries, and to give you some context on Technique 1: Do Nothing: The elephant in the room is Internet Explorer for the desktop. With a mobile-first solution, large screens will display the content in one column, resulting in a painful reading experience for the user, way past the established maximum for comfort: 50 to 75 characters. It might be worth setting a max-width property in your main container and then upping that max-width in a media query.And their CSS: Here's how it'd come together for IE (media query is commented out).Would there be any difference whereby instead of applying that to #wrapper, we would apply it to",Should we be setting width on div#wrapper or the <body>?

It simply shows the radio button with no Radio Label as in this case.Though I can see the complete code: What is explanation?P.S.The main problem that occurred to me is the automatically closing of input tag as I mentioned in the question as I am using var DOM_tag = document.createElement(""input""); which automatically creates a closing tag.

Can line-height Attribute Inherit Parent Div's Height Property," I have a div with height 50px that contains a child div. The height of the child div is inherited from the parent by using the css attribute/value pair: height: 100%. I want to verically align the text in the child div and to do so I add the line-height property to the child div. Notice that for line-height I have to explicitly define the height as 50px. The child div can inherit the height property from the parent (using height: 100%) but for line-height I must explicitly set the value? If so, this is (IMO) kindof messy because let's say I have a div that is nested 10 levels deep and it inherits the height property all the way down. Then if I want to vertically align the text within this div I have to not only hard-code the value to equal the height of the upper-most parent div but I have navigate through my code to find the parent that explicitly defines the height.Note that I don't want to define line-height at the parent level and then use inherit at the child node to get the value.It would be nice if there were a way to set line-height equal to the height of the div that it resides in. Perhaps the syntax would look like the following (totally made up): Where line-height uses the from-property method to access the height property. (Yes, I know having a method such as from-property introduces the potential for a circular dependency so perhaps some other way would be better. I am simply using it to express what I would like to have.)Thanks!Jan <code>  <div style=""height: 50px;""> <div style=""height: 100%;"">Some Text</div> </div> <div style=""height: 50px;""> <div style=""height: 100%; line-height: 50px;"">Some Text</div> </div> <div style=""height: 100%; line-height: from-property('height');"">Some Text</div>",Can line-height Attribute Inherit Parent Div's Height Property Or Access Height Property Of The Div To Which It Belongs?

How do I make a div dynamically change to content width AND have it remain that width even as the browser window changes size?," Take a look at this: (Scenario 1) http://jsfiddle.net/DQFja/1/Very simple. A div with a bunch of other divs within it. Parent div has a fixed width of ~1000 pixels, children divs are set to display:inline-block; When you make the browser window smaller than the parent, a scroll bar appears and you can scroll to see the rest.Now take a look at this: (Scenario 2) http://jsfiddle.net/zZRq7/Same parent and children, but the width of the parent is dynamically determined by the number of div children you place in it. Which is dandy. However, when you make the browser window smaller, the parent div becomes as wide as the window and the children start wrapping around, making the parent taller (Even though we set a fixed height!)How do I make the parent div BOTH dynamic in width as in scenario 2, but then also keep its shape/height/width when the browser window gets smaller so we can get a scrollbar? <code>  #container { height:150px; border:1px solid pink; width:1100px;}#widget { display:inline-block; width:100px; height:100px; background-color:red;} #container { height:150px; border:1px solid pink; float:left;}#widget { display:inline-block; width:100px; height:100px; background-color:red;}",How can I make a div dynamically change to content width and have it remain that width even as the browser window changes size?

Jquery Event wont fire after ajax call," This is a rather strange issue with jquery. I am loading a div on page load. Each record is tabular data with a 'delete' ajax function associated with it.

PHP - 'The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared' issues," I made a form that users can fill out and it checks if the user correctly inserts the email.If it returns false: the user gets to see an error message.If it returns true: it will show the user a confirmation message but it will also INSERT the data into the database.So the problem occurred when I tried to add the form in the PHP file so I could make an alert or give the user the error message on the same page. I started to get this error: The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must to be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.So I tried to restore this by reverting to the older version, I had to cut and paste a few pieces of code but nothing too complicated. For some strange reason I still get this error. Naturally I checked the similar topics on this issue here on Stackoverflow but none of the answers got me any further. For example adding the meta information in the header of the page,I also created a PHP header like this: header('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8');After that I read some articles about this error but none helped me resolve this issue.Here is an example of my code. It is this page I get the error on: I had to rename the variables and classes as they have strong relations with the company I work for.EDIT: This error is being produced by the console log in Firefox using Firebug.EDIT 2: Changed the var and function names to avoid confusion and to illustrate the exchange of data within this application.EDIT 3: I tried to figure out what exactly in my code is producing this error, because I tested the encoding part with the test case presented to me below by Dobromir Velev and that worked just fine. I decided to comment out the IF ELSE statement and I didnt get an error. So this seems to corrupt the page. I removed the echo's for now as it didn't add any value to this particular challenge.

HTML/CSS: Webkit browsers cut up link," What I haveI have a normal HTML link, like <a href=""#"">Link</a>. In my stylsheet, I have set that link to display: inline-block; because I have to push it around a bit to match the layout.The font-style is set to italic.The problemThis leads to the following problem: Because the text is set in italics, the last letter of the linked word exceeds the box around the link. Because of that, Safari & Chrome ""cut up"" a color change on hover. See that screenshot where I assigned a background color to the link to make it more clear.The normal link color is the light one, the blue one is the hover color. Firefox manages this correctly without cutting anything up. Setting a padding for the link would probably be the simplest solution, but I feels like a workaround for me. Is there any other solution?Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qD78e/ <code> ",HTML/CSS: Webkit browsers cut up italic link

"HTML=5 date field shows as ""mm/dd/yyyy"" in Chrome, even when valid date is set"," I just upgraded an ASP.Net MVC application to MVC-4. The field editor for inputs based on DateTime values now include's the HTML-5 type=""date"" attribute/value declaration.Now, when viewing in Chrome, my date inputs show up with ""mm/dd/yyyy"" in the input field:Even when I pass in a correctly-formatted date with the value attribute: I'm still getting ""mm/dd/yyyy"" in the input box, which is there until the user manually changes the value.The problem appears to be with Chrome, and is independent of my back-end framework. See this problem in action: jsFiddle...big problem for editing records, of course. If the user pulls up a record that already has a valid date, it won't pass validation on submit, unless s/he clicked into the field and reset the value manually.No problems with the other browsers.Is this a Chrome bug? Or have I missed something about the way the HTML-5 date field is supposed to work?UPDATESee this revise fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/HudMe/5/ It has both an HTML-4 and an HTML-5 date input, each with ""10/01/2012"" set as the value on page-load.Click into either date field.The Javascript should pup up an alert with the value of the field for that element.Because a valid date has been passed in with the value attribute, this should show ""10/01/2012"", but in Chrome, for the HTML-5 date field, nothing shows. Reset this value by hand, then click again, and it will now show.The value from the HTML5 field shows and alerts as expected without adjustment after pageload in Safari, Firefox, IE and Opera.Note on accepted answer:For other users of Asp.net mvc-4, you can adjust the display format with the [DisplayFormat] attribute on the DateTime field declaration in your view-model.

How to send new HTML data from the server to the browser without refreshing the page," I have seen many websites (facebook or stack overflow for instance) that will update certain features as new data is generated (new answer on a post for example). Lets say that there is a new post added to a blog and someone is in the blog in that moment looking at it, the idea is to automatically add the new post to the blog without refreshing or having the user to do any action.I have thought of executing an AJAX call every 5 seconds or so, but that will make too many requests to the server, and I saw that the websites I mentioned (which renew content) don't make any new requests.I am really out of ideas of how to achieve this. Is this possible with PHP and AJAX? I've heard of websockets too. Any ideas?Thanks <code> ",How to push new HTML data from the server to the browser without refreshing the page

Paragraph of text in circle [CSS]," I have been looking around for a decent and fast solution on how to place a paragraph of text inside a circle. I found there are two solutions.Solution 1Float multiple div's of the same height as the text to the left an right of the text, and by changing the divs width you adjust the space left over for the text.Solution 2Use the generator for the same thing, http://www.csstextwrap.com/index.php.BONUS (not part of the problem, just a tip)I am not looking for this, but maybe someone might need it, and I think its nice to have it as a link > http://csswarp.eleqtriq.com/ Its a web based generator that helps you wrap your text around the circle.The Question?Is there a simpler solution to putting paragraph of text inside a circle without having to add floating div's and additional markup.

The best case scenario, the solution would have clean HTML markup with few tweaks in the CSS. <code> ",Paragraph of text in circle using CSS

HTML5 Canvas Equalized Alpha-Blending," So I have an animation that I'm coding in javascript and HTML5 (no libraries, no plugins, no nothing and I'd like it to stay that way). The animation uses physics (basically a bunch of unusual springs attached to masses) to simulate a simple liquid. The output from this part of the program is a grid (2d-array) of objects, each with a z value. This works quite nicely. My problem arises when drawing the data to an HTML5 Canvas.That's what it looks like. Trust me, it's better when animated.For each data point, the program draws one circle with a color determined by the z value. Just drawing these points, however, the grid pattern is painfully obvious and it is difficult to see the fluid that it represents. To solve this, I made the circles larger and more transparent so that they overlapped each other and the colors blended, creating a simple convolution blur. The result was both fast and beautiful, but for one small flaw:As the circles are drawn in order, their color values don't stack equally, and so later-drawn circles obscure the earlier-drawn ones. Mathematically, the renderer is taking repeated weighted averages of the color-values of the circles. This works fine for two circles, giving each a value of 0.5*alpha_n, but for three circles, the renderer takes the average of the newest circle with the average of the other two, giving the newest circle a value of 0.5*alpha_n, but the earlier circles each a value of 0.25*alpha_n. As more circles overlap, the process continues, creating a bias toward newer circles and against older ones. What I want, instead, is for each of three or more circles to get a value of 0.33*alpha_n, so that earlier circles are not obscured.Here's an image of alpha-blending in action. Notice that the later blue circle obscures earlier drawn red and green ones:Here's what the problem looks like in action. Notice the different appearance of the left side of the lump.To solve this problem, I've tried various methods:Using different canvas ""blend-modes"". ""Multiply"" (as seen in the above image) did the trick, but created unfortunate color distortions.Lumping together drawing calls. Instead of making each circle a separate canvas path, I tried lumping them all together into one. Unfortunately, this is incompatible with having separate fill colors and, what's more, the path did not blend with itself at all, creating a matte, monotone silhouette.Interlacing drawing-order. Instead of drawing the circles in 0 to n order, I tried drawing first the evens and then the odds. This only partially solved the problem, and created an unsightly layering pattern in which the odds appeared to float above the evens.Building my own blend mode using putImageData. I tried creating a manual pixel-shader to suit my needs using javascript, but, as expected, it was far too slow.At this point, I'm a bit stuck. I'm looking for creative ways of solving or circumnavigating this problem, and I welcome your ideas. I'm not very interested in being told that it's impossible, because I can figure that out for myself. How would you elegantly draw a fluid from such data-points? <code> ",HTML5 Canvas Creative Alpha-Blending

CSS: Removing the Bevel Effect on the Corner of Borders," If an element exists on a page with more than one border color, the corner where these colors meet create a bevel by default. This seems like an odd choice for the border-corner style. I would instead prefer that one of the borders ""overpowers"" the other border such that a straight line is shown instead.To illustrate this effect, consider the following:See example jsFiddle example I created here.The top two items display the default, beveled behavior. The bottom two display the desired, expected behavior, where in this case, border-top ""overpowers"" or ""overrides"" the corner of border-left and border-right.The markup for the top case: And the CSS: The markup for the bottom case: And the CSS: Although the second method I devised does produce the effect I want, it seems as if this is unnecessarily tedious for something that I would have assumed to have the default state. If I were to want the border-left to override the other borders, for example, I would have to deal with some float: left and inline element madness.The Question (Finally)Is there any easier method of removing the default bevel-behavior observed on all browsers?Although the case detailed above is mostly easy for having the border-top or border-bottom overriding the corners, it is not as easy of a task, for example, if I need the border-left and border-right to override the border-top and border-bottom. <code>  <div class=""container""> <div class=""border"">Item one</div> <div class=""border"">Item two</div></div> .container { margin: 5px; width: 150px; background: yellow;}.border { padding: 5px; border: 15px solid red; border-top: 15px solid teal;} <div class=""container""> <div class=""border-top""></div> <div class=""border-reg"">Item one</div> <div class=""border-top""></div> <div class=""border-reg"">Item two</div></div> .border-top { border-top: 15px solid teal;}.border-reg { border: 15px solid red; border-top: 0; padding: 5px;}",Removing the Bevel Effect on the Corner of Borders

Making canvas ball moving smoothly," I wrote a multiplayer pong game, but because of a ~60ms lag my bouncing ball is not moving smoothly. The game itself is available here, but since it works only on chrome, and the site itself is written in my native language (also you obviously need two browsers in order for it to work), here is jsfiddle of the problem:http://jsfiddle.net/yc6Lb/75/As you can see in the fiddle, dx and dy are defined and the refreshes per second is defined as speed. I need those three variables to remain constant (I know that they are causing the ball to not move smoothly).Now the question: Are there any tricks to not touch those variables, but make the ball look like it moves smoothly? I was thinking about rendering the new position of the ball + rendering previous position of the ball with 50% opacity, but I have yet to test it. Are there any other solutions to this problem? <code> ",Making a canvas ball move smoothly

How to remove shadow root from HTML element adorned with shadow DOM from template? [Web Components]," I'm exploring imports, templates, shadow DOM and custom elements in Chrome Canary (33.0.1712.3). In a grid layout I have a particular content element (region of the display) that will display different web components or cloned light DOM fragments imported from files. However, I'm unable to redisplay ordinary HTML DOM once a shadow DOM has been added because I don't know how to remove the shadow root. Once created, the shadow root remains and interferes with the rendering of ordinary DOM. (I've looked at various W3C specs such as intro to web components, shadow DOM, templates, Bidelman's articles on HTML5 Rocks, etc.) I've isolated the problem in a simple example below:Click ""show plain old div""; click ""show shadowed template""; click ""show plain old div"". Inspect in devtools after each click. After the third click, there is no output below the buttons and in devtools I am seeing: What do I need to add to removeShadow() to remove the shadow root and fully reset the content element to its initial state?removing_shadows.html <code>  <div id=""content""> #document-fragment <div id=""plaindiv"">Plain old div</div></div> <!DOCTYPE html><html lang=""en""><head> <meta http-equiv=""content-type"" content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8""/> <template id=""shadowedTemplateComponent""> <style> div { background: lightgray; } #t { color: red; } </style> <div id=""t"">template</div> <script>console.log(""Activated the shadowed template component."");</script> </template> <template id=""plainDiv""> <div id=""plaindiv"">Plain old div</div> </template></head><body><div> <input type=""button"" value=""show plain old div"" onclick=""showPlainOldDiv()""/> <input type=""button"" value=""show shadowed template"" onclick=""showShadowTemplate()""/> <div id=""content""></div></div><script> function removeChildren(elt) { console.log('removing children: %s', elt); while (elt.firstChild) { elt.removeChild(elt.firstChild); } } function removeShadow(elt) { if (elt.shadowRoot) { console.log('removing shadow: %s', elt); removeChildren(elt.shadowRoot); // Leaves the shadow root property. // elt.shadowRoot = null; doesn't work // delete elt.shadowRoot; doesn't work // What goes here to delete the shadow root (#document-fragment in devtools)? } } function showPlainOldDiv() { console.log('adding a plain old div'); var host = document.querySelector('#content'); removeChildren(host); removeShadow(host); var template = document.querySelector('#plainDiv'); host.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true)); } function showShadowTemplate() { console.log('adding shadowed template component'); var host = document.querySelector('#content'); removeChildren(host); removeShadow(host); var template = document.querySelector('#shadowedTemplateComponent'); var root = host.shadowRoot || host.webkitCreateShadowRoot(); root.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true)); }</script></body></html>",How to remove a shadow root from an HTML element adorned with a Shadow DOM from a template?

Why use the TH tag instead of TD tag," I'm reading up on the differences between the HTML th and th elements used in <table>According to http://webdesign.about.com/od/tables/f/blfaqthvstd.htm , the th element defines the current cell as a table header. It then goes on to say that some browsers will render the th element differently (defined by the browser) but the article then advises not to style the TH ourselves (via CSS I assume).I'm completely confused by this; It is suggesting that to use th element gives us no design control and has no value/importance...I know some elements are older and some become obsolete, but I find no mention that the th element is depreciated nor can I see any value in it. Would some one let me know if I've miss-understood please. Does Google read TH differently (again, my research shows nothing), does the th element help the browser to render the table, or is it just an option to use if we want to? <code> ",Why use the th element instead of td element?

WordPress: Add Button/Link Immediately After Title to Custom Post Type Edit Screen," I'm customizing the backend of a WordPress installation for a client, and I've added several custom post types. They are displayed on the front-end via a custom loop inside one page, so users shouldn't access the individual custom posts.To help ensure they aren't accidentally accessed, I've removed the Permalink selection box, which includes the View Post button. I'd like to add a View Post link at the top of the page, beside Add New Employee. (If not possible, I would settle for intercepting and replacing the Add New Employee button)I'm looking for a WordPress hook to place the button there, but I haven't found anything yet. The closest I found was a post on the WP Core blog (citing edit_form_advanced, edit_form_after_editor, edit_form_after_title), but none of the ones listed will work for this.The button I'd like to add will be this PHP: With $displaypage being something along the lines of '/about-us/our-people/#'Really though, all I need help on is finding a way to hook it in. I know what to add once I find out how to add it.Edit: I know that I could insert the button using javascript, without bothering with hooks at all. I'd like to avoid that if possible though, for edge cases of people who disable JS, and people who have very slow connections (jQuery won't activate until the page is fully loaded, so it'll flash in late in that situation). <code>  <a class=""add-new-h2"" href=""<?php echo $displaypage.get_the_title($post_ID); ?>"">View <?php echo $posttype; ?></a>",Add Button/Link Immediately After Title to Custom Post Type Edit Screen

"WeChat sharing, how to change re-share description and thumbail?"," QuestionIs there a way to provide a custom title, description and thumbnail for when my website pages are shared from within WeChat?BackgroundWe have an iPhone app from which users can publish/share posts with their friends using WeChat (aka Weixin).When sharing from the app a title, a description and an image are posted via the API for the shared page (these display as desired when shared from the app). Once shared the friends open these pages in WeChat (and not our app).The problem is that when the friends re-share our pages using WeChat's own share button it loses the description we provided. It will re-share with the HTML title tag, the first image on the page (stretched or squished to a square thumbnail) and where the description was originally it just shows the URL of the page.I have tried providing descriptions in a description meta tag but to no luck. I have even tried Facebook style/open graph og:description meta tags.SidenoteI have looked through the source on a Chinese site that seems to have overcome this issue. I think it's solved using a javascript plugin of some sort called WeixinJSBridge. Unfortunately I have been unable to uncover any documentation in English - My Chinese isn't great, and by not great I mean, I can't read a word. <code> ","WeChat sharing, how to change re-share description and thumbnail?"
"How to implement responsive, independently scrolling panes in Bootstrap 3?"," I'm working on a web app for which I want to have two independently scrollable areas on larger screens: a main content area on the left, and a smaller sidebar on the right.I've managed to implement such a layout in CSS using absolute positioning and overflow properties, see this JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/XLceP/This is great, however I'm also attempting to make use of Bootstrap (3.1.1) in order to make the site responsive and for the components/styling. However I'm at a loss at how to do so.Basically, I'd ideally like to use Bootstrap conventions (the column classes etc.) to make it so that on mobile screens the right pane collapses below the left pane (or disappears entirely) for a conventional vertical layout, with both taking up the full width. However it seems impossible to do this while using absolute positioning for the larger screen layout.How can I attempt to tackle this problem? <code> ","How to implement responsive, independently scrolling panes in Bootstrap?"

HTML5 audio tag presenting cannot play audio file in ios," I'm struggling to get simple audio playback. I've got a list of tracks, each at unique url's that I would like to play when a user presses the associated play button. I've attempted soundmanager2 and jplayer but couldn't get it to work for my use case (desktop browser and ios). I have fallen back to straight up html5 with the code as follows This works perfectly in desktop chrome and desktop safari. In ios chrome and ios safari (latest) the player isn't presented, but instead a message within a grey box saying ""Cannot play audio file"" is presented.Am I using this tag correctly? How can I overcome these errors?Update 1I am sending the wav file from google appengine (as a blob). I have found that safari cannot play unless I add .wav to the end of the src - despite the src just being an indirect link to the file. The actual file returned does end in .wav but Safari isn't smart enough to recognise this.Update 2The following works in all browsers (mentioned above) - so it is not specific to wav files. I've sent the file from google app engine as both a MIME attachment and a raw response but it makes no difference.Update 3I've swapped in a longer wav file (http://www.villagegeek.com/downloads/webwavs/ever_again.wav) and this too is unable to play (on ios). It isn't clear if it's because of the length, size or some other variable.Update 4I've ruled out size being the issue because this 24s wav file works Update 5So I'm serving the file from a google cloud storage bucket. When saving the file I'm not specifying the MIME type and as a result it is being returned as binary/octet-stream. The desktop browsers are smart enough to overcome this, but the mobile browsers are not. <code>  <audio controls> <source src=""/path/to/file"" type=""audio/wav""> Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio> <audio controls preload=""metadata""> <source src=""http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/WAVE/Samples/AFsp/M1F1-Alaw-AFsp.wav"" type=""audio/wav""> Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio> <audio controls preload=""auto""> <source src=""http://www.dailywav.com/sites/default/files/wavs/dontlikelaughing.wav"" type=""audio/wav""> Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>",HTML5 audio tag cannot play audio file in ios chrome and safari

Phaser/HTML5: Having trouble destroying sprites," I'm having trouble destroying Sprites in Phaser.I have a JavaScript object, let's call it Block. Block has a sprite property, that gets set like so: At a certain point in my code, Block is referenced by two different arrays: On a certain Update() cycle, I need to destroy the sprite, so I'm using the following code: On the next Update() cycle, when I look at destroy[0], I would expect to see: However what I'm seeing is: With the properties just defaulted and set to false. My worry is, if I were to now set destroy[0] to null, what will happen to that sprite object? Will it just float around or will it get cleaned up automatically?Should I be destroying the Block object first in some way?Also, if destroy() is not nulling the reference, how is it different from kill()?Any thoughts on the matter will be greatly appreciated. <code>  this.sprite = this.game.add.sprite(this.x, this.y, 'blocks', this.color); square[0] = Block;destroy[0] = Block; square[0].sprite.destroy(true); //Destroy the sprite.square[0] = null; //Remove the reference. destroy[0].sprite: null destroy[0].sprite: b.Sprite",Destroying sprites in Phaser

if div height reaches a fixed height then add a class. can this be done?," I have some modules on my project that are generated dynamically. This basic HTML will work fine as an example of what I want to achieve: My problem is that I don't want this module to ever grow too much vertically, if the web administrator writes a long ""description"" (I can't limit how much he wants to write as the ""description"" text will show on other pages).I found a nice CSS trick to add ""ellipsis"" to a multiple lines container. Here you can see this ""trick"" in the .ellipsis (plus the basic CSS): You can see everything together here: JSFIDDLEThe problem I have is that while ellipsis works fine, I don't want ALL the modules to have a fixed height. I just want to limit the max-height to a fixed size. (Just delete ""height: 200px;"" from "".ellipsis:before"" to see what I want to achieve.) So, the problem is the .ellipsis:before fixed height. 100% height won't work unless I turn the position to absolute, but then the ""ellipsis"" trick won't work as the float won't take effect.Any help with my problem will be greatly appreciated. I don't think there may be a pure CSS solution, (trust me, I have tried) and I'm very bad a JavaScript/jQuery. However, if you have a jQuery solution that may help, I could implement it in the project (and give you nice rep points here :) ).

Is there a better way to do this without using scrollTop? I understand that it is causing relayouts, and was curious if there was a better way. Here is the main code from the --JSFiddle-- ** To try it out, make sure you click inside the fiddle output area so that the key events will trigger, then use the down/up arrows **I also need the scrollbar to work, so if the only better option is to use CSS3 transformY, I would have to build a custom scroller. <code>  function scroll() { var focusedBox = focused.getBoundingClientRect(); if (focusedBox.bottom > containerBox.bottom || focusedBox.top < containerBox.top) { requestAnimationFrame(function() { var distance = focusedBox.height + 10; animate(distance, focusedBox.top < containerBox.top); }); }}function animate(distance, up) { if (distance >= speed) { container.scrollTop += (up ? -speed : speed); requestAnimationFrame(function() { animate(distance - speed, up); }); } else { container.scrollTop += (up ? -distance : distance); }}",Animating scrollTop in fixed height overflow without jank

`tabindex` doesn't work on label," I'm trying to replace checkbox/radio inputs with icons. For this, I need to hide the original checkbox/radio. The problem is, I also want the form to properly support keyboard input, i.e. let the input remain focusable by Tab key and selectable using Spacebar.

However, when I try to assign tabindex to my label, it remains as unfocused as ever, however much I try to Tab to it.Why doesn't tabindex make the label focusable?The following snippet demonstrates the issue. If you focus the input with your mouse and try focusing the label using Tab, it doesn't work (it focuses the following <span> with tabindex instead).

Draw clickable grid of 1 milion squares," I need to find a way to draw a 1000x1000 squares grid, each square is clickable and they must be independently color changeable. Like mines game.

"What exactly does 'serving static files' mean, and should you do it?"," So far I've always been developing my clientside applications without any of my own servers running behind it, using Webstorm's built-in webserver to serve my content.What I frequently see when people use Node with Express to act as their webserver is the debate on if you should put your html files with node or with the client code. I understand javascript files that are included in html or css are best stored in the client directory?So my first question is, with a folder structure like this Should you include your html pages in your server or your client directory?Secondly:Sometimes I see people use express.static for static files, what exactly is implied by static files here? Today most websites are not static documents anymore but are files that get altered by javascript by manipulating the DOM, so I don't think any html files should be considered as static files?As far as I can see, the only advantage I have with using Node instead of the built-in webserver is if I want to have database access. <code>  app/ client/ js files server/ node files",What exactly does 'serving static files' mean?

Specifying the hash of a script <script> from an untrusted host," Is there any implementation or specification for including a hash or signature in an attribute of a <script> tag, so that the browser can verify that the correct file was retrieved before executing it? Something like: The motivation is this: generally, each additional CDN or host you use for your site increases your vulnerability, by adding a new target that can be hacked to compromise your site. Allowing your primary front-end servers to assert hashes or signatures of those files could entirely eliminate that risk, allowing you to be more flexible when designing your architecture. You could even request missing files from an untrusted peer-to-peer network.I thought I remembered a specification about this, but haven't been able to find it. <code>  <script src=""http://cdn.example.com/jquery-2001.js"" signature=""sha-256/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855""></script>",Specifying the hash of a script from an untrusted host

prevent iOS bounce without disabling scroll ability," I am trying to implement a solution to prevent the iOS bounce effect in Safari for iOS when a web page content is larger than the viewport.The page I am working on is quite specific in it's structure, and is very similar to this page http://new.salt.ch/The basic structure is bootstrap-based.It has a fixed navbar at the top.It has a full-screen background slideshow.The slideshow has an overlay that is fixed to the bottom of the viewport.There is a footer element that loads off-canvas and is only visible on scrolling the content.The content scrolls behind the navbar.The content consistes of a title which is positioned 20px below the navbar and a series of buttons that are positioned 20px above the viewport.When scrolling, the buttons and title all move up the screen to display the footer.The problem I am having is the same as the problem on the page http://new.salt.ch/ in that when you scroll up, you get a bounce effect at the bottom of the screen and which reveals the background and overlay.I have tried various solutions, including iNoBounce.js, Nonbounce.js and a few other suggestions I have found on SO.I have the same issue always...when I try to disable the bounce, all scrolling gets disabled. I am guessing this is because the content (other than the footer) is always just large enough that the scroll is not needed, and so scrolling gets disabled and the footer no longer is accessible on scroll. <code> ",Prevent iOS bounce without disabling scroll ability

How to vertically stretch a block element to fill the vertical scroll height of its parent," I have a layout with a vertical scroll.

Vertically centered image in div when height of image is larger than height of div," I have a responsive design with a header image which is placed in a container. The image has width:100%; and height:auto; so it grows as you enlarge the viewport. I don't want to exceed a certain height so the container has a max-height. The image still grows but now the bottom part is cut off now because it aligns to the top of the container.I would like the image to stay vertically centered in it's container so that parts of the image are cut off at the top and at the bottom. The outcome should look like this:The header images are uploaded by users so they might have different heights therefore I cannot work with specific pixel-values. Is there a CSS-solution for this or do I have to use JavaScript?Here is the code: And I prepared a fiddle. <code>  .wrapper { width: 90%; max-width: 600px; margin: 1em auto; background-color: #E9ADAD;}.container { text-align: center; height: auto; line-height: 200px; max-height: 200px; overflow: hidden;}img { width: 100%; height: auto !important; vertical-align: middle;} <div class=""wrapper""> <div class=""container""> <img src=""http://placehold.it/600x300/C00000/FFFFFF&text=Image+vertically+centered""> </div></div>",Vertically center image when image is higher than container

Can aria-disabled only be applied to an element with a role? Doesn't it apply to child elements also?," I've created a page using Bootstrap with a standard layout of next and previous page links. On the first page, I disable the 'previous page' link as follows: It seems like screen readers (JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) aren't seeing the aria-disabled=""true"" flag, even though the W3C WAI-ARIA spec states: The state of being disabled applies to the current element and all focusable descendant elements of the element on which the aria-disabled attribute is applied.If I add aria-disabled=""true"" to the link: then it works as I'd hoped, with the screen reader describing the link as 'disabled'.Am I misunderstanding the WAI-ARIA spec, or is this a 'feature' of screen reader implementation? In his comment on 'How do i tell a screen reader that a link is disabled', Bryan Garaventa mentions: ... the use of aria-disabled works best for elements that have a defined role, such as role=button.Can aria-disabled only be applied to focusable elements? <code>  <div role=""navigation""> <ul class=""pager""> <li class=""previous disabled"" aria-disabled=""true""> <a href=""#"">Previous page</a> </li> <li class=""next""> <a href=""search.php?page=2"">Next page</a> </li> </ul></div> ... <li class=""previous disabled"" aria-disabled=""true""> <a href=""#"" aria-disabled=""true"">Previous page</a> </li> ...",Can aria-disabled only be applied to a focusable element?

"How can I manipulate an html table (for column reordering, visibility) using jquery/javascript?"," I have an ASP.NET MVC site and I have a HTML table in a view. As per the example html code I sometimes have nested tables inside of cells but that can be ignored until you get to the end of the question. I now want to to use this jQuery multiselect plugin to allow the user to select the ordering of columns they want as well as show / hide certain columns So I am creating a multiselect that looks like this: to allow the user to pick the ordering and then I am going to store this data in local storage for the time being. So all I am storing is an array of strings that represent the ""visible order of columns"" which is used to setup the multiselect picker. This works fine and I am able to persist this array or ""ordered column names"".My question is what is the best way to take this string array and update the HTML table to reflect this column ordering and column visibility?I know there are larger html table grid frameworks that have this feature but in this case I need to stick with a hand coded html table.Update:@Rick Hitchcock's answer below got me 90% of the way there but there is one open issue that I realize complicates my question a bit. In certain cases, I have a nested table inside the main table. I have updated the question to include this situation.

"Is SMACSS, BEM and OOCSS not as portable?"," SO I have a problem with OOCSS. It is supposed to be more portable but compared to how I usually do things, I'm finding it less so.My example:I have a widget testimonial. In the main content body (which has a white background) the testimonial has a black font. But in the footer (which has a blue background) the testimonial needs a white font.Before OOCSS, I would do something like this: With this ""old"" approach, I could drag my widget from the content area to the footer and the colours would simply work - I wouldn't need to change my CSS or DOM classes of the widget.With the new OOCSS/BEM, I am NOT supposed to couple the .testimonial class to the ID (or to the location), but rather I should subclass it like so: The problem with this is that I can no longer drag my testimonial from the content area to the footer without going into the DOM and changing the classes on the testimonial widget - It is LESS portable as it requires manual intervention by a developer; whereas before an editor could just drag it and the styling was automatic.Am I missing something? There seems to be no solid real-world examples out there? <code>  #main-content .testominial { color: #000000;}#footer .testominial { color: #FFFFFF;} .testominial { color: #000000;}.testominial--footer { color: #FFFFFF;}","Are SMACSS, BEM and OOCSS not as portable?"

Fit inline elements in a row with Bootstrap," I'm using Bootstrap 3 to design my website and I would like to fit a text input and 3 buttons horizontally in a div. Here is my markup: But the text input spans to the whole div's width and the buttons get pushed underneath it.I've tried setting the text input's display mode to inline and inline-block but it didn't change anything. <code>  <div style=""width: 400px""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text""> <a class=""btn"" href=""#"">Button 1</a> <a class=""btn"" href=""#"">Button 2</a> <a class=""btn"" href=""#"">Button 3</a></div>",How to fit inline elements in a row with Bootstrap?
CSS align image while keeping height," I have an image, that I want to be aligned to one side of a div. I also have paragraphs that need to go alongside this image. However, they do not have enough text content to reach all the way down the height of the image. The content beneath the paragraphs I have needs to be below the image.Using float:left for the image does not work, since the container div for the image with the desired alongside paragraphs does not respond to the height of floated elements.Using position:relative; left:0px for the image also does not work. With this, I have tinkered with the display of the paragraphs, but they always go beneath the image instead of beside. Here is the Fiddle.EDITAfter reviewing these answers, I found a more elegant solution: This takes the idea of clear fix and makes it more readily-applicable. <code>  h3 {text-align:center}img {position:relative;left:0px}p {display:inline-block;} <body><div> <div> <h3>Header Here</h3> <img src=""http://www.devtano.com/software/eco/images/console.png""/> <p>This paragraph should be next to the image.</p> <p>This paragraph should also be next to the image.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Another Header</h3> <p>Everything from the above header and down should appear below the image.</p> </div></div></body> h3 {clear:both; text-align:center}img {float:left; margin-right:10px}",Align image while keeping height

AngularJS: How do I reset a form including removing all validation errors?," I have an Angular form. The fields are validated using the ng-pattern attribute. I also have a reset button. I'm using the Ui.Utils Event Binder to handle the reset event like so: As you can see, when the form is reset it calls the reset method on the $scope. Here's what the entire controller looks like: I'm calling form.$setPristine() and form.$setUntouched, following the advice from another question here on Stack Overflow. The only reason I added the counter was to prove that the code is being called (which it is).The problem is that even after reseting the form, the validation messages don't go away. You can see the full code on Plunker. Here's a screenshot showing that the errors don't go away: <code>  <form name=""searchForm"" id=""searchForm"" ui-event=""{reset: 'reset(searchForm)'}"" ng-submit=""search()""> <div> <label> Area Code <input type=""tel"" name=""areaCode"" ng-model=""areaCode"" ng-pattern=""/^([0-9]{3})?$/""> </label> <div ng-messages=""searchForm.areaCode.$error""> <div class=""error"" ng-message=""pattern"">The area code must be three digits</div> </div> </div> <div> <label> Phone Number <input type=""tel"" name=""phoneNumber"" ng-model=""phoneNumber"" ng-pattern=""/^([0-9]{7})?$/""> </label> <div ng-messages=""searchForm.phoneNumber.$error""> <div class=""error"" ng-message=""pattern"">The phone number must be seven digits</div> </div> </div> <br> <div> <button type=""reset"">Reset</button> <button type=""submit"" ng-disabled=""searchForm.$invalid"">Search</button> </div></form> angular.module('app').controller('mainController', function($scope) { $scope.resetCount = 0; $scope.reset = function(form) { form.$setPristine(); form.$setUntouched(); $scope.resetCount++; }; $scope.search = function() { alert('Searching'); };});",How do I reset a form including removing all validation errors?
Creating dynamic drag and drop templates," I have a requirement of developing a functionality where user can dynamically define a template (labels, textboxes, labels, rows, columns, parent child relationships among above elements etc). These elements(such as combo boxes) may be bound to different database tables.For example, the user may define a template T1 for a specific use case U1. But this template is not restricted to U1 only. It may be needed to be used in another use case U2, where it is a sub part of a bigger template.Once the templates are defined, another user may load the templates (HTML form) and enter data into it. At a later stage, I need to reuse this data and template to generate PDF reports. Since PDF reports may sometimes need to have a different layout than the HTML form, I would need parent child relationships between elements as well.As of now, we are achieving by generating an XML from a user interface where a user can select elements from a dropdown and specify properties. At run time, these XML are transformed to HTML using XSLT. Another XSLT is used for generating PDFs. The limitation of this scheme is that it is very tedious to incorporate any user requests (such as multiple columns, add tables into forms etc).I was wondering how other people achieve this and is there an API/Library for doing the same ?I have looked at HTML5 and JQuery drag and drop features, but it would require me to add everything from scratch (such as dynamically add columns,rows etc.) <code> ",How to create dynamic drag and drop templates?

HTML with PHP - <script>-section suddenly ends - bug?," I encountered a very strange behaviour in php-html-mixed code. I'm using XAMPP 3.2.1 (PHP 5.2.0) and IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.This is what my code looks like (scrubbed for readability, if you need more let me know): What happens when that loop runs n times, that for n-1 everything looks fine, but in the n-th run, within the <script>-section the code suddenly stops. The HTML-File ends properly with all tags closing.This looks as following (n=4): Or (n=2): Note that with an increasing n, the stop does not occur later in a deterministic way. That means when I tried n=3, the below was the result: I'm at the end of my knowledge. What causes this?As requested more code: The delimiter accessed through the global variable is ;. It is defined in a file called functions.php, that is included through require_once(""functions.php); in the index.php (code above).The following shows the text file being parsed (note that this is not the best solution, but is the first incremental step towards a full blown database). Note that the products (Foo, Bar, ...) are grouped by their product lines (Steel, Copper, ...) and then sorted by the numbers in column 3 (third value in the ;-seperated rows).Accessing the steel-group echo $lineData[$i] shows the following: This is as expected exactly the same as in the file being parsed.Update: Changing to another php version (5.4, 5.6) does not resolve the issue.Update: In Powershell ""C:\xampp\php\php.exe index.php | Out-File test.html"" produced an html file, that did NOT have the issue described above. So there is a workaround. I will digest further into IntelliJ IDEA.In the meantime I also removed the <p>...</p> tags which did not fix the issue. <code>  <?phpfor($i=0; $i<count($stringArray); $i++) { $pieces = explode($GLOBALS['delimiter'], $lineData[$i]);?> <div> ... <input id=""<?php echo $pieces[$someValidNumber]; ?>_identifier"" ...> ... <script> // some javascript with <?php echo $variable; ?> </script> ... </div><?php } ?> $('input[id$=""MegaSteel_tons""]').val(output2);$('#MegaSteel_cart').prop( $('input[id$=""BarZwo_meters""]').val(output2);$('#BarZwo_cart').prop('type', 'button').change $('input[id$=""Bar_meters""]').val(output2);$('#Bar_cart').prop('type', 'button').change();var price $lineData = array();$f = fopen('products.csv', 'r');while (($line = fgetcsv($f)) !== false) { if (strpos($line[0], $productLine) !== false) { // the above produces single value arrays, thus we access them with [0] $pieces = explode($GLOBALS['delimiter'], $line[0]); $index = (int)$pieces[2]; // todo: input must check that index is not already taken $lineData[$index-1] = $line[0]; }}fclose($f);ksort($lineData);for ($i = 0; $i < count($lineData); $i++) { $pieces = explode($GLOBALS['delimiter'], $lineData[$i]); $prod_name = $pieces[0]; $prod_lineNumber = $pieces[2]; $prod_quantity = $pieces[3]; $prod_tons = $pieces[4]; $prod_meters = $pieces[5]; $prod_pricePerTon = $pieces[6]; ?> <p> <!-- User-Input--> <b> <?php echo $pieces[0]; ?></b> - <?php echo $prod_lineNumber; ?><br/> Units: <input id=""<?php echo $prod_name; ?>_quantity"" type=""text""> Tons: <input id=""<?php echo $prod_name; ?>_tons"" type=""text""> Meters: <input id=""<?php echo $prod_name; ?>_meters"" type=""text""> Price per ton: <?php echo $prod_pricePerTon; ?> Calculated price: <span id=""<?php echo $prod_name; ?>_price"">0</span> <input id=""<?php echo $prod_name; ?>_cart"" type=""hidden"" value=""Add to shopping cart!"" onclick=""addToCart('<?php echo $prod_name; ?>')""> <!-- Auto-Update--> <script> // first field - quantity $('input[id$=""<?php echo $prod_name; ?>_quantity""]').on('keyup', function () { var value = parseFloat($(this).val()); var output1 = value * <?php echo $prod_tons .

Fixed position within parent instead of browser," I need to position a header to be fixed within the containing parent so that it follows when scrolling. The problem is that fixes the position to the browser, not the parent. What this is resulting in is that when I have a container that has a horizontal scroll for overflow in the width (the content is wider than the container), my fixed header does not have the overflow-scroll as the content of the table does.See this fiddle demoSo the goal here is to fix the position of the header, but fixed relative to it's parent container. In this fiddle, you can see that I've commented out a block of css: If you replace the current css block (with transform set to none) with the one with translateZ, the header will get positioned within it's parent container, but is no longer fixed.Anyone know how to solve this? Preferred solution would be CSS/HTML only and avoid JS but if nothing else, then JS is of course what I need to go with! <code>  position:fixed .container{ /*-webkit-transform: translateZ(0); -moz-transform: translateZ(0); -ms-transform: translateZ(0); transform: translateZ(0);*/ -webkit-transform: none; -moz-transform: none; -ms-transform: none; transform: none; }",Position fixed within container element instead of the browser / viewport

"How to darken the background image (no hovering, no clicking, just darkened)"," I am pulling my hair out over this. I have tried literally everything I have found and at this point I'm guessing I must just be making some kind of mistake. I am trying to darken the background image so that it is not quite as saturated.Here is my HTML: And my CSS: This gives me a background that completely covers the page. But I want to darken it (without hovering, or clicking). Everything I have tried has NOT achieved any darkening whatsoever (I've tried fake-gradients, reba stuff, etc.), and somehow gets in the way of <div id=""slogan""> and <nav>, pushing them all over the place.Is my formatting just totally incorrect? <code>  <body id=""home""> <header> <nav> <ul class=""pull-left""> <li><a href=""#"">Bearbeard Logo</a></li> <li><a href=""#"">World</a></li> </ul> <ul class=""pull-right""> <li><a href=""#"">Eretikas</a></li> <li><a href=""#"">Custom</a></li> </ul> <div id=""slogan"">THE HERETIC SWORD</div> </nav> </header></body> #home { background-image: url(file:///Volumes/Animus/Jon/Dropbox/website/hellcity.jpg); -webkit-background-size: cover; -moz-background-size: cover; -o-background-size: cover; background-size: cover;}nav li { display: inline; position: relative; float: left;}nav a { color: #5a5a5a; font-size: 11px; font-weight: bold; padding: 14px 10px; text-transform: uppercase;}#slogan { color: #FFFAF0; font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; opacity: 0.5; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;}",How to darken a CSS background image?

Use of the sizes attribute for reponsive images," I'm in the process of trying to wrap my head around using srcset and sizes on img tags. Whilst I think I have grasped the basics mainly thanks to this article I'm struggling in practical application of the sizes attribute.In all the examples I can find, things are massively simplified and the sizes attribute is declared as if at each breakpoint, the image width will be an exact proportion of the viewport width, allowing the use of vm units. For example: Of course in real life, images are often within other containers which themselves might be within other containers and so on, each with their own margin, padding or positioning.Is it fair to say that in all but the simplest cases (when images are of fluid width and are not simply an exact percentage of the viewport), calc must be used, potentially adding hideously complex calculations to the html markup as an images dimensions need to be calculated working from viewport width, down through any containers to the image? For example how would you calculate the correct size for an image located a container with 7px padding that is itself inside a container that is 45% of its container with 15px margin that is inside a sidebar that is 25% of the main page container which has 15px of padding and has a min-width of 1220px? Trying to calculate this in the sizes attribute seems ludicrous, especially given that all this might change at each breakpoint. having to keep this massively complex calculation in sync with changes to the CSS seems like madness. And then you have the patchy browser support for calc.I feel like I'm missing something obvious, but what is it?Note: I'm aware of Alexander Farkas's excellent Lazy Sizes which does the size calculations for you through the use of data attributes, but I'm interested in standard usage. <code>  sizes=""(min-width: 36rem) 33.3vw, 100vw"" sizes=""(min-width: 36rem) calc(((((1220px - (2 * 15px) * 25%) * 45%) - (2 * 15px) - (2 * 7px)), 100vw""",Use Of the Sizes Attribute for Reponsive Images

What am I doing wrong? <code>  window.URL = window.URL || window.webkitURL;$(""form"").submit(function(e) { var form = this; e.preventDefault(); //Stop the submit for now //Replace with your selector to find the file input in your form var fileInput = $(this).find(""input[type=file]"")[0]; file = fileInput.files && fileInput.files[0]; if (file) { var img = new Image(); img.src = window.URL.createObjectURL(file); img.onload = function() { var width = img.naturalWidth, height = img.naturalHeight; window.URL.revokeObjectURL( img.src ); if( width == 400 && height == 300 ) { form.submit(); } else { //stop } }; } else { //No file was input or browser doesn't support client side reading form.submit(); }});",Client-side image resolution/size validation

"CSS: Replacing a text on hover, but smooth transition of new text does not work?"," The scenario: If a user hovers over a text (e.g. an h1-tag), it should change to a new text. The new text should appear smoothly. What I've done so far:I was able to replace a text with a new one with the ""display:none"" and the ""content: 'This is the new text' ""-property. My problem is that the new text does not appear smoothly (it does not fade in/transitions). I've also tried to use opacity, but it doesn't replace my old text (instead it just disappears and the new text appears next to it).Here is a JSFiddle and code snippet:  <code>  .my_div { background-color: red;}.my_div:hover { background-color: green; transition: all 500ms ease-in-out;}.my_div:hover .title span { display: none;}.my_div:hover .title:after { content: ""A wild text appears"";} <div class=""my_div""> <h1 class=""title""><span>This is the old text</span></h1></div>","CSS: Replacing a text on hover, but smooth transition to the new text does not work?"

Make last element take remaining width with wrapping," Im looking for a way to align multiple items next to each other, having them wrap once they fill up the line, and the last item take up the remaining width of the last line.I have found multiple questions on a similar topic before, with solutions generally making the items use float: left to align them on a line, and overflow: hidden on the last element which makes it take up the remaining space automatically. Those solutions work fine in a single line, but they stop working once there are enough items before the last element, that they wrap into multiple lines. Then, the last element is still rendered in the first row (if there is enough space), making it no longer be the last element.However, I want the last element to stay the last element at all times, to have it in the last rowwhatever row that isand automatically take up the remaining space there.This is pretty simple with a wrapping flexbox, since you just need to put flex: 0 auto on the former items to make them take up whatever space they need (without taking more), and flex: 1 on the last element to make it take up the remainder. However, I need to support Internet Explorer 9, so flexbox is unfortunately out of the question.This is how the situation looks like. When running the snippet, you can use the Toggle flex box button to toggle flexbox mode which shows the way it should look like.  <code>  * { box-sizing: border-box; }.container { width: 300px; background: snow; padding: 5px; overflow: auto;}.element { float: left; margin: 2px 5px 2px 0; background: lavender;}.last { overflow: hidden;}.last > input { width: 100%;}/* Working solution with flex box */.flex .container { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;}.flex .element { flex: 0 auto;}.flex .last { flex: 1;} <div class=""container""> <div class=""element"">Foo</div> <div class=""element"">Foo bar</div> <div class=""element"">Foo bar baz</div> <div class=""last""><input type=""text"" /></div></div><div class=""container""> <div class=""element"">Foo</div> <div class=""element"">Foo bar</div> <div class=""element"">Foo bar baz</div> <div class=""element"">Foo</div> <div class=""element"">Foo bar</div> <div class=""element"">Foo bar baz</div> <div class=""last""><input type=""text"" /></div></div><button onclick=""this.parentNode.classList.toggle('flex')"">Toggle flex box</button>",Make last element take remaining width with wrapping (and with IE9 support)

Wheel of luck - HTML without Canvas," I want to make ""Spinning Wheel"" type of game, in that the user can choose three possible outcomes, and then, after they can spin the wheel, if any of the chosen three come up then he/she is a winner.In the demo below you can see that, after spinner stops, the result is not the right value. After spinner itself stops it continues and changes the value -- and in before the last it's always the lightbulb. (Please view this FULLSCREEN to see what I'm referring to.)How can I fix this? If there is any other demo similar like my functionality. then Help may be appropriated.

PrismJS: Centering Higlighted Lines Vertically," PrismJS is a syntax highlighter for source code in Web pages. It has a line-highlight plugin that highlights certain lines in the source code. In particular, that plugin supports determining what lines to highlight from the hash (e.g., #play.5-6 says to highlight lines 5 through 6 of the <pre> element with an id of play).For that hash, the plugin uses scrollIntoView() to ensure that the highlighted lines are visible: (here line-highlight is added as a class to the lines)However, scrollIntoView() puts the highlighted lines at the top. In my use case, it would be better to have the highlighted lines be vertically centered, assuming that the highlighted range is shorter than the available space.What would I replace that above line with, in order to have those highlighted lines be vertically centered?FWIW:While I'm OK with CSS/JS, I'm not an expertIf it matters, my use case is to show this code in a WebView widget in an Android app <code>  document.querySelector('.temporary.line-highlight').scrollIntoView();",PrismJS: Centering Highlighted Lines Vertically

How do you invalidate index.html for a static file hosted on S3 with cloudfront?," So I have hosted my angular app on s3 with a cloudfront dist. I do file revision-ing (using grunt filerev) to make sure that I never get stale content. But, how should I version the index.html file. Its required because all other files are referenced inside index.html.I have configured my bucket to be used as a static site. So it just picks up the index.html when I reference the bucket in url.Cloudfront says that you should set min TTL to 0, so it would always hit origin to serve the content. But, I don't need this since I am doing file revisioning of all my files (except index.html). I can take advantage of cdn caching for these files.They also say that in order to invalidate a single object, set the max-age headers to 0. I tried adding following to my index.html But this does not reflect once you upload on s3. Do I need to explicitly set headers on s3 using s3cmd or dashboard? And do I need to do this every time when index.html changes and I upload it?I am aware that I could invalidate a single file using cmd but its a repeating process and It would be great if it can take care of itself just by deploying on s3. <code>  <meta http-equiv=""Cache-Control"" content=""public, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0""/>",How do you invalidate cache of index.html for a static site hosted on S3 with cloudfront?

Is it possible to add a bootstrap modal lighbox and a slider carousel?," It seems quite challenging to add both the Bootstrap Carousel Slider and Lightbox Gallery in a single page without significant issues.Problem: When clicking on the lightbox image gallery it opens up the picture gallery and at the same time the Carousel slider image gets hijacked by the gallery images.

Using CSS flexbox in split-panes - panel is not fully minimized," I implemented my own split-pane with HTML/JS/CSS Flexbox.I'm having trouble with the splitter in the following case- one of the panels has a fixed size (in px), and the other one is set to grow (flex-grow: 1).In case the other panel has children with size, it won't scroll to the end. It gets stuck at the size of the children.Can this be fixed with CSS on the split-pane panels but not on the children?It's very important for me to use flex as I want to maintain responsiveness of my application, and want to avoid fixed sizes wherever I can.This is a JSFiddle sample of my question.

Scale text (inside multiple divs) within container to fit perfectly," So I have a matrix of divs within a container in my page, each div displays either a '1' or a '0'.If I set my container to a width of 100% and height to fit the bottom of my page, I want to be able to scale all of the 1's and 0's inside the container's divs (the number of 0's and 1's will be a static number, lets go with 100 for the sake of this question) to always fit the container perfectly no matter what size the browser is resized to, so it fits the width and height of the container perfectly without any trailing white-space or elements that go off the page or trigger a scroll bar. The goal is to make sure the fonts resize to fit within the container exactly, regardless of screen size (both height and width).I have seen multiple similar questions on stack overflow, such as: JavaScript Scale Text to Fit in Fixed Div, but they all seem to scale a certain line of text rather than the text from my combined divs.Is there a way I can do this within JavaScript? If you see what is being asked for in This Question, this is exactly what I want. The difference in that Q is that he uses some text within 1 div rather than multiple to fit his container.Here is my HTML: Here is my CSS: See Fiddle: FiddleThis project is also on GitHub: GitHub - danjonescidtrix/binary-matrixAny help or advice here is appreciated, thank you in advance <code>  <div id=""binaryMatrix"" style=""width: 100%; height: 100%;""> <div>0</div> <div>1</div> <div>0</div> <div>1</div> <div>0</div> <div>1</div> <div>0</div> <div>1</div> ...up to 100 </div> #binaryMatrix div { float: left;}",Resize font text (inside multiple divs) within container to fit perfectly

Distribute items in flexbox evenly amongst multiple rows," When my flexbox container has more than a certain number of elements, I want it to use multiple rows. Here is my current solution: http://codepen.io/samkeddy/pen/mOwZBv?editors=1100The problem is the items in the last row get stretched to fill the row. What I want is for it to distribute the elements evenly between rows, so that every element is as close to the same size as possible.For example, there are a maximum of 6 elements per row. When you have 8 elements, it puts 6 on the first row, and 2 on the second. I want it to put 4 on each row. Is this possible with flexbox?

Why is mouout fired when mousein is performed on a child element?," The definition of mouseout event from MDN is as: The mouseout event is fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved off the element that has the listener attached or off one of its children.So if I have a container div to whom mouseout is attached then I expect the event to be fired if the mouse moves out from any of its children. But what I am seeing is if mouse is moved in to container's child even then mouseout is being fired. Here is the example: When the mouse is entered into the h3 the mouseout on div.over is triggered. Why? Edit: Please mention authoritative reference to back up your claim.  <code>  x = 0;$(document).ready(function(){ $(""div.over"").mouseout(function(){ $("".over span"").text(x += 1); }); }); <script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js""></script><div class=""over"" style=""background-color:lightgray;padding:20px;width:250px;float:left""> <h3 style=""background-color:white;"">Mouseout event triggered: <span></span></h3></div>",Why is mouseout fired when mousein is performed on a child element?

So that it doesn't hide my body content and looks good as well.P.S: these problem don't occur when I resize window to mobile view, because hamburger menu appears.Full WindowMobile Viewand the code for navbar is default with ASP.NET Core web application only thing I changed was its theme to ""inverse"" Here's the code <code>  <div class=""navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top""> <div class=""container""> <div class=""navbar-header""> <button type=""button"" class=""navbar-toggle"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target="".navbar-collapse""> <span class=""sr-only"">Toggle navigation</span> <span class=""icon-bar""></span> <span class=""icon-bar""></span> <span class=""icon-bar""></span> </button> <a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""Index"" class=""navbar-brand"">ChromSACT</a> </div> <div class=""navbar-collapse collapse""> <ul class=""nav navbar-nav""> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""Index"" class=""aa""><span class=""glyphicon glyphicon-home"" style=""margin-right:6px;""></span>Home</a></li> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""Cell"">Input</a></li> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""CellResult"">Marks</a></li> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""CellResultRegions"">Regions</a></li> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""ClusterBits"">Cluster Bits</a></li> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""RegionsMatrix"">Regions Matrix</a></li> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""MarksMatrix"">Marks Matrix</a></li> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""Compare"">Compare</a></li> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""About""><span class=""glyphicon glyphicon-alert"" style=""margin-right:6px;""></span>About</a></li> <li><a asp-area="""" asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""Contact""><span class=""glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"" style=""margin-right:6px;""></span>Contact</a></li> <li><button data-toggle=""modal"" data-target=""#myModal"" class=""btn navbar-btn btn-group-sm""><span class=""glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"" style=""margin-right:6px;""></span>Instructions</button></li> </ul> </div> </div></div><div class=""container body-content"" > @RenderBody() <hr /> <footer> <p>&copy; 2016 - ChromSACT</p> </footer></div>",Bootstrap navbar overlapping body content

How to center absolute children in a Flexbox in Safari?," I have a container that contains both an image, and some text. I want the text to be vertically and horizontally centered in the middle of the image.It seems that the easiest, forward-thinking method is to use Flexbox and absolute positioning of the text: The text is centered in both axes. This seems to work in all modern browsers..... except Safari.Safari appear to not center the text at all. It's just sitting at the top/left of the container like a normal absolutely positioned element would be in a non-flexbox layout.Safari (wrong):All other browsers (correct):I thought Flexbox was really ready for primetime, but this seems like a deal-breaker considering how many people using Safari on iOS. Centering content horizontally and vertically is something Flexbox should be great at.My only real alternative here is to not use Flexbox and then use: But I would much rather be using Flexbox for progressive reasons.Is there anything I'm missing here? As much as I hate to ask for it, is there some of Safari-only work-around here? Is there any solution to this besides just ""not using flexbox"" because if that is the answer in mid-2017 that is going to be disappointing.JSFiddle for reference: https://jsfiddle.net/z7kh5Laz/4/ <code>  .container { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; position: relative;}.text { position: absolute;} <div class='container'> <div class='text'> This should be centered </div> <img src=""https://placehold.it/250x250"" /></div> .text { position: absolute; left: 50%; top: 50%; transform: translate(-50%,-50%);}",How to center absolutely positioned children of a flex container in Safari?

Beautiful Soup find first <a> whose title attribute equal to a certain string," I'm working with beautiful soup and am trying to grab the first tag on a page that has the attribute equal to a certain string.For example: What I've been trying to do is grab the href of the first that is found whose title is ""export"". If I use soup.select(""a[title='export']"") then I end up finding all tags who satisfy this requirement, not just the first.If I use find(""a"", {""title"":""export""}) with conditions being set such that the title should equal ""export"", then it grabs the actual items inside the tag, not the href.If I write .get(""href"") after calling find(), I get None back. I've been searching the documentation and stack overflow for an answer but have yet found one. Does anyone know a solution to this?

wrapping divs with gaps between them," I have divs that i want to wrap to the next line when the browser window gets smaller.

See my screenshot below as an example and this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/uhh2jwe2/ (change the width of the window)This really needs to be dynamic as it will be a framework solution for laying out differently sized divs. The parent div will be fluid similar to the example.

How to allow only whitelisted scripts to run within a sandboxed iframe?," I am looking for an approach to allow only whitelisted scripts to run within a sandboxed iframe. I was thinking of an iframe-sandbox directive that allows only whitelisted scripts to run within an iframe. The analogy is the script-src directive in the Content Security Policy.The problem: The app in the iframe provides valuable functionality for my website. However, it pulls in external resources that I would like to control (i.e., block), e.g., AnalyticsJavaScript.com and TrackingPixel.com. I would like to allow scripts from app.thirdparty.com but block AnalyticsJavaScript.com and TrackingPixel.com.

Why are duplicate ids not allowed in HTML," Under what circumstances is it illegal for an HTML page to contain elements with duplicate ID attributes?As a developer who has worked with HTML for many years, I am aware that the intention is that element ids should be unique - what I am asking is for the practical negative effects of duplicate ids. Granted, getElementByID()-like functions in some libraries might return arrays rather than a single element and this could cause issues when the developer had not anticipated this case. However, as far as I know, such functions will continue to operate so clearly they are not a breaking-effect of id duplicates.So why is it that duplicate ids are said to be not allowed?EDIT: The driver for the question was that I saw some templating libraries when generating list/repeated items, producing elements with duplicate ids and I wondered what the impact of that might be in practical terms and how to decide whether to adopt those libraries.I also wondered about the effect of modal plugins, or any other, that might clone an existing hidden node and thereby create a duplicate via code, and then what the browser would do in that case.  <code> ",Why are duplicate ID values not allowed in HTML?

CSS 3 Grid Layout responsive: Is it possible to always have an even number of columns with auto-fill?," Hey there I am new to CSS grid. Have a look at the following example: Basically the grid works great. However I never want to break the grid such that 3 items are on top and only one item is in the next row.I want to have either 4 columns, or two colums, or one. (How) can I achieve this behavior? Edit: The code snippet now shows the three possible cases. Case 2 is unwanted. <code>  .platform { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr)); grid-gap: 20px;}.item { width:100%; background-color:#aaa; padding:10px; box-sizing:border-box; text-align:center;}.wrapmed { max-width:400px;}.wrapsmall { max-width:300px;} <div class=""platform""> <div class=""item"">a</div> <div class=""item"">b</div> <div class=""item"">c</div> <div class=""item"">d</div></div><br/><br/><div class=""wrapmed""> <div class=""platform""> <div class=""item"">a</div> <div class=""item"">b</div> <div class=""item"">c</div> <div class=""item"">d</div> </div></div><br/><br/><div class=""wrapsmall""> <div class=""platform""> <div class=""item"">a</div> <div class=""item"">b</div> <div class=""item"">c</div> <div class=""item"">d</div> </div></div>",Is it possible to always have an even number of columns with auto-fill?
autocomplete=new-password and making them confirm it," html5 now has some new attribute values for the autocomplete attribute to assist user-agents when autofilling forms. One of the new values, new-password, is used to tell the user agent to enter a new password, opposed to the user's current password. What's not clear to me though, is how to properly tell it to generate the same password for both fields when your form makes the user enter the new password twice as a confirmation? Maybe by using the same custom section-* prefix on both inputs, such as autocomplete=""new-password section-my-new-pw""? The spec mentions the section-* prefix will affect the autofill scope, but it's not overly specific about what that means for my case.Here's a sample form that I imagine will represent what many websites will soon use - it distinguishes the current-password from the new-password, and makes the user confirm the new password. I much prefer if answers reference a documentation opposed to observations about how current browsers or extensions behave. <code>  <form> <p>Username <input type=""text"" autocomplete=""username"" name=""username""></p> <p>Current Password <input type=""password"" autocomplete=""current-password"" name=""current-password""></p> <p>New Password <input type=""password"" autocomplete=""new-password"" name=""new-password""></p> <p>Confirm New Password <input type=""password"" autocomplete=""new-password"" name=""confirm-new-password""></p></form>",autocomplete=new-password and making them confirm it via entering the password again
Scale to fit when printing Web page," I have a Web page with a diagram that is meant to be fixed in size to width:1660px;height:480px; using CSS. The page (am I allowed to link to it?) displays properly in the browser, but when printing in Google Chrome (I haven't tested other browsers yet), it is too big horizontally to fit in a single page. How do I scale the HTML to fit one printed page?Here's what the output might look like (Firefox 60):I have tried messing around with media queries such as this: But I cannot notice any effect in the print preview.[edit]Internet Explorer 11 seems to be able to scale the page automatically in the print dialog. I don't know why Google Chrome can't do this as well.[edit]I tried transforming the page too. However the printed result is very different in Chrome vs IE11. Next, I tried zooming the page. This worked pretty well, but I don't know if it only affects Chrome or if it affects IE and Firefox as well. In either case, there's no way for the user to disable the effect when using CSS, unless you create new JavaScript controls too. <code>  @media print{ @page { size: 297mm 210mm; /* landscape */ /* you can also specify margins here: */ margin: 250mm; margin-right: 450mm; /* for compatibility with both A4 and Letter */ }} @media print{ html { transform: scale(0.5);transform-origin: 0 0; }} @media print{ html { zoom: 50%; }}",Scale HTML to fit one page when printing

Programmatically disabling Chrome autofill," Theres some discussion about this around the internet (especially here on stack overflow), but quite a lot of it dates from around 2015, so I was wondering if anyone had any recent experience.We use a JavaScript widget to power type-ahead search functionality on web forms, but this UI is consistently overlaid with the Chrome autofill.While autocomplete=off used to work, Chrome seems to ignore this value now, and show the UI anyway. The only thing I can find that works with Chrome 66/67 on OSX is an invalid value, such as autocomplete=blah. This seems way too sketchy though, and we have experimented with this before and it gets ignored in certain situations/Chrome versions.Has anyone fond a reliable way to turn this off using HTML/Javascript?As a side note - it looks like even Google cant turn it off when needed, as their own Google maps type-ahead widget gets overlaid by the Chrome autofill. This can be seen on most Shopify stores. <code> ",Programmatically disabling Chrome auto-fill
Best way to style markdown with CSS," I used Jekyll on our website to layout the site using GitHub pages. Works great. One problem was that markdown tables wouldn't be laid out correctly. Found that there is no default style for tables, so unless you explicitly specify some styles for the table. The code looks like this: This works great when used with Jekyll. But when similar code is used on the GitHub Wiki for the same repos, the tag, and its contents are rendered too. Code for that looks like: The table is rendered fine but the style tag gets rendered as text.Suggestions? Some way to hide the style tag?Additionally I found this question/answer which suggested this code addition: Unfortunately, it doesn't work - at least not on the GitHub Wiki. <code>  ---layout: pagepermalink: ""/membership/join/""title: Joining the Readium Foundation---<style>.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th { border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; }</style>| Company Type | Total Company Revenue | Member Dues ||:-------------:|:-------------:|:------------:| <style>.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th { border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; }</style>| Publication | URL | Langauge ||:-------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|| epubsecrets | [http://epubsecrets.com/](http://epubsecrets.com/) | English | (setq markdown-xhtml-header-content""<style> .tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th { border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; }</style>"")",Best way to style markdown

Chart.js inside flex element won't shrink even with min-width: 0;," I have tried setting the min-width to 0 on the wrapper div for chart.js, but the chart will grow and then not shrink back down if you drag the window around.I can't figure it out! The only thing I can do is set width to 99% but then the chart is no longer aligned with my other divs. I've been working on this for days, please help!Q: How can I get chart.js to be 100% width, and grow/shrink to it's bounding size.to reproduce, go to the example and if you close the menu, the chart grows, and if you open it, the chart does not shrink back down. it maintains it's size and overflows to the right.note: my actual project has two separate components for the chart and side bar. So a calc solution doesn't work in this case, I don't want to tightly couple any components to maintain good practice.Here is my StackBlitz working examplehere are pictures to show the reproduction:chart is the right size, menu openchart grows when you close the menu (the size is still correct)open the menu, and the chart overflows right <code> ",Chart.js in flex element overflows instead of shrinking
Prevent a grid-area div from resizing when its child has overflow hidden," I'm using the following grid layout: To create a centered area that fills most of the screen while leaving some padding around it. Inside this 1fr x 1fr grid area is a pane div which contains an editor div which contains a content div.The content div can be any height, and the editor div has overflow: scroll set. My problem is that instead of pane staying the same size and editor handling the overflow, pane grows and causes the whole page to scroll.I can keep pane from growing by setting its overflow: scroll, but this causes the editor itself to scroll, rather than its content. This is unacceptable because the editor has buttons which must always be on screen.Is there a way, within grid layout, to allow this functionality? I originally had it working with a flex layout, where the pane div was a single item within a 100% x 100% flexbox. I switched to grid to allow me to easily resize side-menus, so implementing this without grid is not preferable. Also, multi-browser support would be amazing, but my target browser is Chrome.Here's a jsfiddle with my reproducing my problem.  <code>  grid-template-columns: 10em 1fr 10em;grid-template-rows: 2em 1fr 2em; body, html { width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: 0; margin: 0;}#site { width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: #000; display: grid; grid-template-rows: 10em 1fr 10em; grid-template-columns: 2em 1fr 2em; grid-template-areas: 'top top top' 'lpn mid rpn' 'bot bot bot';}#pane { grid-area: mid; height: 100%; width: 100%; background-color: #f0f;}#editor { display: relative; overflow: scroll;}#content { height: 2000px;} <div id='site'><div id='pane'> <div id='editor'> <div id='content'> </div> </div></div></div>",Prevent grid area from expanding causing whole page to scroll
"In angular7, how do i change the height of a mat-select when shows the list of items?"," In Angular7, how can I increase the height of a mat-select when it is showing the items?

How to display media files stored in Amazon S3?," I have integrated Amazon S3 with my Django app. A media folder has been created in my S3 bucket, and when users upload a file it shows up there just fine. What I'm unclear about is how to display these files in the template. Currently the code is: I've also tried: Another thing to keep in mind is when I try to access these files from the S3 account I get this output. Not sure if this is a permissions issue or what. However, in the admin the image shows up fine.No longer getting access denied-I made access public (Not sure if this is the only/best way to do it). Still unclear on how to display it in template. The url gives a 404 error.In Admin the file path is /folder/file.jpg, but in the template the file path is /media/folder/file.jpg. I think this could be the source of the problem, but not sure why media is there.Any help would be appreciated. <code>  <img src=""https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/myprojectbucket/media/{{ model.file }}""/> <img src=""{{ model.file }}""/>",How to display media files stored in Amazon S3 in Django template?

Flexbox: How to center middle item in a flex row," What I want as a result:I have three elements in a container that is a display: flex I want the left item to be aligned to the left, and the right item to the right. With the center item aligned in the center. space-between is not the fix. It is not the solution I am looking for. This is because the elements are differing widths. Even with differing widths, I still want the middle element to be centered. This could be fixed with a wrapper. and then put a flex: 1 on the wrappers, then within those wrappers, have the elements themselves. Again, this is not the fix I am looking for. I cannot use wrappers in my situation.  <code>  .parentContainer { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;}.parentContainer > *{ background: red; text-align: center;} <div class=""parentContainer""> <div class=""left"">small</div> <div class=""middle"">medium element here</div> <div class=""right"">longer element is here too</div></div>",How to center the middle item in a flex row?
How to listen to CSS change in selenium?," I have a div that is a save button that has an awesome font symbol. After clicking the div, a new CSS class disabled is added where the opacity is reduced to visually signal the clicking of the button. After the save event the disabled CSS class is removed again and the button is fully visible again. If I try to verify this by Selenium naively the adding of the CSS class and the removal is too fast for Selenium, i.e. is working and finds the button and clicks it, but the next find throws a NoSuchElementException: It doesn't work with explicit wait neither (I didn't mention for simplification). Selenium is too slow to recognize the change, i.e. the CSS class is removed before the second find started. Do I need something like a listener started before the click event, maybe via JavaScript solutions of Selenium? Any other approach? Looks like threading a wait before is not possible in Selenium. <code>  driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("".save-button"")).click(); driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("".save-button .disabled""));",How to listen to CSS change in Selenium?
Expanding to fill remaining," I want to use CSS grid and the following is a mock-up of the aim:I'm building an interface that should expand rightward to fill the browser screen; my current code causes column 2 of the outer grid to be as wide as the browser in addition to column 1; or maybe one of it's children is causing this and it's just expanding to accommodate. Either way, it's spilling off the page horizontallySo the code: FYI, for the time being I've forgone template areas until I get a handle on the basics (unless this somehow solves my problem but I gather this is strictly a code organization feature?).  <code>  #main { width: 100%; display: grid; grid-template-columns: 250px 100%; grid-template-rows: 100px 100%;}#col-2-outer { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 250px auto; grid-template-rows: 100%;}#row-1-inner { grid-column: span 2;}#col-2-inner table { width: 100%;} <div id=""main""> <div id=""col-1-outer""></div> <div id=""col-2-outer""> <div id=""row-1-inner""></div> <div id=""row-2-inner""> <div id=""col-1-inner""></div> <div id=""col-2-inner""> <table></table> </div> </div> </div></div>",Expanding to fill remaining space in a CSS Grid layout

I have made the table successfully, but now I have one requirement to show some new data in a row like on click expand rowTable functionality:I am populating my table Some brand wise each brand has some items inside them, which I want to show when the brand is clickedI almost created the table, but not able to create the expandable rowMy one of column is populating wrong data alsoIn my code I have commented all the lines what I am doing at which lineIssues I am facingI have already commented the line where I am calculating netamount to populate inside tbody as GRN entery brand wise but that's causing the issueI have created two code snippets one as full static HTML like what I want, and a second to show what I have done.The help I have found on Google I want to create something like the above snippet, but its expanding on clicking of row. I want to do it when the user clicks on plus icon, which I figured out how to do.My dynamic code with JSON data I have tried the other approach, which was when the user clicks on any brand I was making an Ajax call and running the query on the basis of that brand name and getting data, but still not able to get the expand functionality.Now I realised that this is the best approach to get the data at once, then make table with that; I am just struggling to get it rightDynamic Code Working processCurrently I have table with Brand Name,Grn Entery,Sales Sales body data which is in percentage I am calculating it by dividing grn by Total grn of that column and dividing it by 100So when user clicks on any brand names's icon that is plus in my case I want to expand rows with all itemnames of that brand and whole structure of table will be same as it is for brandname wise, grn calculation wil all be according to item name, currently it is as per brand nameEdit/updateI am having some issues:First of all using this code I am geting brand names and item names but it is taking NA also, I have tried to filter it out but haven't succeeded. Please check my snippet, I have commented all lines there.when there is transactiontype:sales and itemname and brandname= NA then I am populating those values in header as sales value they don't have any relation with calculating percentagewhen I am populating the item inside brand there I have to do it dynamically I have tried but didn't get that <code>  <script

"Anchor hyperlink to the show/hide button of a spoiler, making the spoiler appear through the link"," My colleague and I worked on a website that contains a FAQ page. After each question, there is an ""Answer""(Antwoord) spoiler button. Clicking the button shows the answer below the current question, and above the next question. Clicking the button again hides the answer. This makes it easy to scroll through the list of all questions and find the question you could be interested in.Now the problem I face is that I want to link to for example the answer of question 5, from the answer of question 1.I could give the <div> that contains question 5 an id= property to link to that, but ideally, I want to show the answer straight away by making the hyperlink ""click"" the Answer button.It turns out that I will need to modify the checkbox hack in order for this to properly work, but I face the problem that I can't have both an Hyperlink and a Label on one piece of text.Just to be clear: I'm looking for a solution using only HTML/CSS.My original code with just a spoiler button Trying to implement solutions from: Can I have an onclick effect in CSS?I get the following which doesn't work: Using combinations of <label> and <a href> (also not working) Also related How to toggle a checkbox when a link is clicked?There are some great suggestions there, but I'm unable to adapt the answer from Tushar to my situation. <code>  .spoilerbutton { display: block; border: none; padding: 0px 0px; margin: 10px 0px; font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; outline: 0;}.spoiler { overflow: hidden;}.spoiler>div { -webkit-transition: all 0s ease; -moz-transition: margin 0s ease; -o-transition: all 0s ease; transition: margin 0s ease;}.spoilerbutton[value=""Antwoord""]+.spoiler>div { margin-top: -500%;}.spoilerbutton[value=""Hide Antwoord""]+.spoiler { padding: 5px;} <strong>1.

Read an HTML table in R with mixed character encodings," I'm trying to read tables into R from HTML pages that are mostly encoded in UTF-8 (and declare <meta charset=""utf-8"">) but have some strings in some other encodings (I think Windows-1252 or ISO 8859-1). Here's an example. I want everything decoded properly into an R data frame. XML::readHTMLTable takes an encoding argument but doesn't seem to allow one to try multiple encodings.So, in R, how can I try several encodings for each line of the input file? In Python 3, I'd do something like: <code>  with open('file', 'rb') as o: for line in o: try: line = line.decode('UTF-8') except UnicodeDecodeError: line = line.decode('Windows-1252')",Read a file in R with mixed character encodings

Caret disappears in firefox when saving its possition with Rangy," This happens only in Firefox.Important: I am saving the caret's position with rangy.saveSelection():when click the content editable divon keyupwhen adding an external html element (as a node) to the content editable divI need the position saved constantly through multiple means to be able to insert html elements on click (I have some tags).When I click in the contentEditable div and the div is empty (first focus, let's say), I cannot see the caret unless I start typing. If the caret is at the end, I cannot see it either.Another weird behaviour is that I cannot use the arrows to navigate between the text in the contentEditable div.If I remove the functions which (constantly) saves the caret's position (on input, click etc.) the caret returns to normal (the caret is visible).The problem appears when I start saving the position of the caret. Clearly I should be doing some sort of reset or a clear.. but from what I understand, those seem counterproductive (as from my understanding they destroy the saved caret location).The content editable div My methods/functions As you can see in the saveCursorLocation(), I was trying to solve the scenario in which you click in the contentEditable div and there's no caret - which is confusing for the user. It was a dead end - most likely because of my poor understanding of Rangy and how should I use those functions.Expected behaviour vs actual results on FirefoxWhen I click on the contentEditable div I expect the caret to appear (while in the background to save my position). When typing, I expect the caret to appear after the last typed character while also on keyup to save my caret's position. Also I expect to be able to navigate the text via left/right arrows and see the caret when doing so.All of these are generated by and If anybody believes that it would be helpful, I can record the content editable div and its behaviour in Firefox.EDIT: I managed to isolate the problem and reproduce it into a JSFiddle - https://jsfiddle.net/Darkkz/6Landbj5/13.What to look for?Open the fiddle link in Firefox, then press one of the blue buttons (SI, SAU, NU) and then look at the input, the caret is not displayed.Click the input, the caret is not displayedWhile typing in the input,the caret is not displayed.

problem with left sticky div inside a scrollable parent container," I have this problem - I have a container that contains some rows and in each row there is a sticky left column and then multiple other columns.

Disable submit button & links on-click in pure CSS (No Javascript)," I have challenged myself to create a visually dynamic and interactive experience in HTML and CSS only (No Javascript). So far, I haven't come across any feature I needed that I couldn't do in pure CSS and HTML. This one is perhaps a bit more difficult.I need to prevent the user from double-clicking<a>, <input type=""submit""> and <button> tags. This is to prevent them double-submitting a form or accidentally making 2 GET requests to a URL. How can this be done in pure CSS? Even if we can't set disabled without JS, there should be some masking technique or combination of styles that can handle it here in 2020.Here is a simple example of an attempt: Unfortunately, this disables it before the actual click event is fired for some reason. Maybe anchors aren't the best way to test? I will continue to make further attempts. <code>  .clicky:focus{ display: none; pointer-events: none;} <a href=""#down"" class=""clicky"">test</a><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p id=""down"">target</p>",How to disable submit button & links on-click in pure CSS?

Why does reading localStorage values require a page refresh to show CSS changes?," I'm trying to use the value of localStorage to display one of two Twitter feeds, one for a light mode theme, the other for dark mode.

How to load only some javascript embedded in html puppeteer," Well, I would like a way to use the puppeteer and the for loop to get all the links on the site and add them to an array, in this case the links I want are not links that are in the html tags, they are links that are directly in the source code, javascript file links etc... I want something like this: But how can I get all references to javascript style files and all URLs that are in the source code of a website?I just find a post and a question that teaches or shows how it gets the links from the tag and not all the links from the source code.Supposing you want to get all the tags on this page for example:view-source:https://www.nike.com/How can I get all script tags and return to console? I put view-source:https://nike.com because you can get the script tags, I don't know if you can do it without displaying the source code, but I thought about displaying and getting the script tag because that was the idea I had, however I do not know how to do it <code>  array = [ ] for(L in links){ array.push(L) //The code should take all the links and add these links to the array }",How to get all links from a website with puppeteer
