"style.display not working in Firefox, Opera, Safari - IE7 OK"," I have an absolutely positioned div that I want to show when the user clicks a link. The onclick of the link calls a js function that sets the display of the div to block (also tried: """", inline, table-cell, inline-table, etc). This works great in IE7, not at all in every other browser I've tried (FF2, FF3, Opera 9.5, Safari).I've tried adding alerts before and after the call, and they show that the display has changed from none to block but the div does not display.I can get the div to display in FF3 if I change the display value using Firebug's HTML inspector (but not by running javascript through Firebug's console) - so I know it's not just showing up off-screen, etc.I've tried everything I can think of, including:Using a different doctype (XHTML 1, HTML 4, etc)Using visibility visible/hidden instead of display block/noneUsing inline javascript instead of a function callTesting from different machinesAny ideas about what could cause this? <code> ","Style display not working in Firefox, Opera, Safari - (IE7 is OK)"

Make a div fill the remaining screen space," I am working on a web application where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.I have a header div and a content div. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:CSS and HTML The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.For anything inside the content div, setting top: 0; will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting header inside content will not allow this to work.Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the table?Update:Elements inside the content div will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the div will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.Update 2:For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside #content would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works. <code>  #page { height: 100%; width: 100%}#tdcontent { height: 100%;}#content { overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */} <table id=""page""> <tr> <td id=""tdheader""> <div id=""header"">...</div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td id=""tdcontent""> <div id=""content"">...</div> </td> </tr></table>",Make a div fill the height of the remaining screen space

How hard is it to master symantic markup and good CSS?," I know this won't be a popular question, because a lot of web designers want to assume that their craft is difficult and valuable.IT IS. But I do not believe that it is difficult because HTML and CSS are difficult to master, I believe its difficult because being a good creative designer is difficult. Please resist the urge to reflexively disagree with me because I consider the language simple.I suck as a designer, thankfully its not my job. However I can take a photo shopped comp and create a pure HTML/CSS web page from it with ease.It is my personal believe that anyone can become an effective HTML/CSS guru in a week or two's study. There just isn't that much complexity (and this is someone with years of experience talking).Crossbrowser coding is not as hard as people make it sound. I develop in Firefox, and tweak for IE, and I'm done, a good CSS reset handles 99% of the issues.Do you disagree with this?

Why does my floated <input> control in a floated element in IE7 slide over to the right when it doesn't in Firefox?," Hopefully a picture is worth a thousand lines of code because I don't want to have to strip down all of the ASP.Net code, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to provide an example (but I'll supply what I can upon request if someone doesn't say ""Oh, I've seen that before! Try this..."") [Actually, I did post some code and CSS - see bottom of question].Here is a portion of a form page being displayed in Firefox:The blue boxes are temporary stylings of a <label> tag and the orange lines are temporary border styles of the <div> tags (so I can see where they extend and break). The <label>'s are styled to float: left as are the <div's on the right. In addition, the descendant controls of the <div> are also float:left purely so they will line up on the top of the <div> (since there are some taller controls like multiline textboxes down below).The radio buttons are generated by an ASP control, so they are wrapped in a <span> - also floated left since it is a descendant of the <div>.Here is the same portion of the screen rendered in IE7:There are a few minor rendering differences, but the big one that's driving me crazy is the extra white space beside the <input> controls! Note that the <span>'s around the radio buttons and checkboxes line up correctly.Although they aren't shown, the same thing happens with drop-down lists and list boxes. I haven't tried wrapping the input controls in a <span>, but that might work. It's an ugly hack, though.I've tried several of the IE7 workarounds for box issues and I've edited the CSS until I'm in pure voodoo mode (i.e., making random changes hoping something works). Like I said, I hope someone will look at this and say, ""I've seen that before! Try this..."" Anyone?Followup 1:I'm using the XHTML 1.0 Transitional <DOCTYPE>, so I should be in standards mode.Followup 2:Here is a small snippet of the generated code for the above (the first control and the last control). Note that this code was generated by ASP.Net and then dynamically edited by JavaScript/jQuery. Here is the relevant portion of the CSS (I double checked to make sure this duplicates the problem): Solution!Matthew pointed me to this page on IE/Win Inherited Margins on Form Elements and that was the problem. The input boxes were inheriting the left margins of all of their containing elements. The solution I chose was to wrap each <input> element in an unstyled <span>.

How do you overcome the html form nesting limitation," I know that XHTML doesn't support nested form tags and I have already read other answers here on Stack Overflow regarding this subject, but I still haven't figured out an elegant solution to the problem.Some say you don't need it and that they can't think of a scenario were this would be needed. Well, personally I can't think of a scenario that I haven't needed it.Let's see a very simple example:You are making a blog app and you have a form with some fields for creating a new post and a toolbar with ""actions"" like ""Save"", ""Delete"", ""Cancel"". Our objective is to write the form in a way that doesn't require JavaScript, just plain old HTML form and submit buttons.Since the action URL is defined in the Form tag and not in each individual submit button, our only option is to post to a generic URL and then start ""if...then...else"" to determine the name of the button that was submitted. Not very elegant, but our only choice, since we don't want to rely on JavaScript.The only problem is that pressing ""Delete"", will submit ALL the form fields on the server even though the only thing needed for this action is a Hidden input with the post-id. Not very big deal in this small example, but I have forms with hundreds (so to speak) of fields and tabs in my LOB applications that (because of requirements) have to submit everything in one-go and in any case this seems very inefficient and a waste. If form nesting was supported, I would at least be able to wrap the ""Delete"" submit button inside it's own form with only the post-id field.You may say ""Just implement the ""Delete"" as a link instead of submit"". This would be wrong in so many levels, but most importantly because Side-effect actions like ""Delete"" here, should never be a GET request.So my question (particularly to those that say they haven't needed form nesting) is What do YOU do?

Custom attributes - Yay or nay?," Recently I have been reading more and more about people using custom attributes in their HTML tags, mainly for the purpose of embedding some extra bits of data for use in javascript code.I was hoping to gather some feedback on whether or not using custom attributes is a good practice, and also what some alternatives are.It seems like it can really simplify both server side and client side code, but it also isn't W3C compliant. Should we be making use of custom HTML attributes in our web apps? Why or why not?For those who think custom attributes are a good thing: what are some things to keep in mind when using them?For those who think custom attributes are bad thing: what alternatives do you use to accomplish something similar?Update: I'm mostly interested in the reasoning behind the various methods, as well as points as to why one method is better than another. I think we can all come up with 4-5 different ways to accomplish the same thing. (hidden elements, inline scripts, extra classes, parsing info from ids, etc). Update 2: It seems that the HTML 5 data- attribute feature has a lot of support here (and I tend to agree, it looks like a solid option). So far I haven't seen much in the way of rebuttals for this suggestion. Are there any issues/pitfalls to worry about using this approach? Or is it simply a 'harmless' invalidation of the current W3C specs? <code> ",Is it recommended to use custom attributes?

"input with display:block is not a block, why not?"," Why does display:block;width:auto; on my text input not behave like a div and fill the container width?I was under the impression that a div is simply a block element with auto width. In the following code shouldn't the div and the input have identical dimensions?How do I get the input to fill the width? 100% width won't work, because the input has padding and a border (causing a final width of 1 pixel + 5 pixels + 100% + 5 pixels + 1 pixels). Fixed widths aren't an option, and I'm looking for something more flexible.I'd prefer a direct answer to a workaround. This seems like a CSS quirk and understanding it may be useful later. I should point out I can already do this with wrapper workarounds. Apart from this screwing with the page semantics and CSS selector relationships I'm trying to understand the nature of the problem and whether it can be overcome by changing the nature of the INPUT itself.Ok, this is TRULY strange! I've found that the solution is to simply add max-width:100% to an input with width:100%;padding:5px;. However this raises even more questions (which I'll ask in a separate question), but it seems that width uses the normal CSS box model and max-width uses the Internet Explorer border-box model. How very odd.Ok, that last one appears to be a bug in Firefox 3. Internet Explorer 8 and Safari 4 limit the max-width to 100% + padding + border which is what the spec says to do. Finally, Internet Explorer got something right.Oh my god, this is awesome! In the process of playing with this, and with much help from the venerable gurus Dean Edwards and Erik Arvidsson, I managed to piece together three separate solutions to make a true cross-browser 100% width on elements with arbitrary padding and borders. See answer below. This solution does not require any extra HTML markup, just a class (or selector) and an optional behaviour for legacy Internet Explorer. <code>  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd""><html> <head> <title>width:auto</title> <style> div, input { border: 1px solid red; height: 5px; padding: 5px; } input, form { display: block; width: auto; } </style> </head>","Input with display:block is not a block, why not?"

jQuery: HTMLInputElement has no method 'val'," I'm looping through cells in a table row. each cell has a text box in it, and I want to take the value of the text box and push it onto an array. Theres more to the function, but this is all that is relevant. For some reason, when I run this code, I get ""HTMLInputElement has no method 'val'."" I thought that input elements were supposed to have a val() method in jQuery that got the value so this makes no sense. Am I missing something, or doing it wrong? <code>  function dothing() { var tds = $('#'+selected+' td'); var submitvals = new Array(); tds.each(function(i) { var val = $(this).children('input')[0].val(); submitvals.push(val); }); }",HTMLInputElement has no method 'val'
CSS - table not using body font size even though I havent set the table font size explicitly..," I have a problem whereby I have set the body font-size to 11px, but tables display font at 16px. I have no idea whats causing this - I have been over the CSS and the output (source when browsing to the page) time and time again. Setting table font-size to 11px explicitly has the desired effect, but I shouldn't need to set it anywhere apart from the body style.I have the following CSS: ...and the output is as follows: I seriously cant see anything which could set the font-size to 16px in the table. This happens for all 3 sections (thead, tfoot, tbody). It also seems that Netbeans 6.9 will not format the table properly, but it does the rest of the document (before and after). Its almost as if there is something wrong with the table, but I can't see what. This happens in Firefox and Opera (most recent versions of both). I haven't tested it in IE because it will never be used in IE. <code>  body { font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; margin: 0px; background-color: #E7D2B8; color: #863F2B;}img.headerImg { width: 100%;}.menu-strip { float: left; width: 20%;}.main-content { float: left; width: 80%;}.clear { clear: both;}ul.menu { margin: 0px; margin-left: 10px; padding: 0px; list-style: none;}ul.menu li { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;}div.footer { width: 60%; margin-left: 20%;}ul.footer-links { list-style: none;}ul.footer-links li { float: left; padding: 20px;}ul.footer-links li:last { clear: right;}table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;}td { vertical-align: top;} <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN""><html> <head> <meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8""> <title></title> <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/CustomerApp_v2/CSS/main.css"" /> </head>",Why is a table not using the body font size even though I haven't set the table font size explicitly?

Best Way To Place an SVG file in HTML," From my research, i understand there are three ways to place an svg file inside HTML:using embed: using object: using iframe: I've experimented with all three on a test rig (django built-in dev server, rendering the pages in Firefox 3.6). Under this obviously sterile environment, i haven't noticed any difference between the three--w/r/t performance or resolution.My Question is whether one of these is better than the other two, and if so, which one. The answer might of course depend on the facts, which i've tried to limit to what's relevant:We frequently display data (e.g, time series) on our website, usually created in response to some user action; based on that user action, a call is made to a database, the data returned is crunched and sent to the plotting engine, which renders a static image which is then embedded in the page--very standard stuff.This works fine, but i would like to add some interactive features to these charts (e.g., tooltips, hyperlinked axis labels, highlighting a group of points w/in a plot). Some of the charts are fairly sophisticated (e.g., multi-panel conditioning) and i have not found a javascript chart library that includes these features. I finally settled on using the same plotting library (Lattice in R) but rendering each chart in svg and then adding the user-interaction features in a post-processing step, which consists essentially of javascript functions which manipulate the XML directly. <code>  <embed src=""plot1.svg"" width=""500"" height=""320"" type=""image/svg+xml"" /> <object data=""plot1.svg"" width=""500"" height=""320"" type=""image/svg+xml"" /> <iframe src=""plot1.svg"" width=""500"" height=""320""> </iframe>",Best Way To Place SVG Content Within HTML

If anybody tells me that if I don't want a heavy Javascript solution I should use JQuery because it is lightweight, I will shoot them in the commentsEdit: I'm adding JQuery tag since that seems to be the best way to get attention from a lot of experts on JS questions, and it is not totally unrelated here. <code> ",<marquee> html tag usage/replacment
HTML5 Audio Stops Playing," I am implementing sound effects in HTML5 audio but after a while, it just stops playing any audio. The file type is correct because it starts fine but then seems to give up. Is there a better way to do this so it consistently plays sound?Here is a link to my implementation. Easy to reproduce by pressing spacebar a lot until it eventually gives up (also shoot the lights for added sounds). http://craftyjs.com/elevatoraction/This occurs for me in the latest version of Chrome (8.0)Edit: I did as Gaurav suggested and only played the same instance of each sound file, but the same sort of problems are present. It will arbitrarily stop playing.Edit 2: I just noticed that whenever I try to play the sound, the networkState is always 1 which according to this means it hasn't fully loaded. That is odd seeing as it still plays sometimes and even when it plays the networkState is always 1 <code>  var sound = new Audio(url);function play() { sound.play();}",HTML5 Audio Plays Randomly

[JS] Force download for Blob created with FileWriter," HTML5 introduces the FileWriter class. With this class you can make Blobs. (A File is an extension of a Blob.) With JavaScript you can make a Blob and for instance show it using the dataURL.Example: But that's not good enough :) I want the newly created (text) file to be downloaded. Not opened in the same or a separate window.Is there a way? There must be. How?(The discussion already exists in the Google Chrome group)UPDATEThe File API has changed, because the specs have changed (or something!?).

If there are two 150px children, the parent should become 300px.Here's a demo of the problem: When you hover over animals, you can see that birds, reptiles and fish are stacked on top of each other. They should show side by side.This is what I want it to look like: I got it by forcing the parent to be a fixed width. But the parent needs to vary based on it's children and not be a fixed width. <code>  <div class=""Parent""> <!-- 3 Children, should be 450px wide--> <div class=""Child""></div> <div class=""Child""></div> <div class=""Child""></div></div><div class=""Parent""> <!-- 2 children, should be 300px wide--> <div class=""Child""></div> <div class=""Child""></div></div> #MainNavBar { background:url('../assets/design/images/MainNavGrad.jpg') repeat-x scroll 0 0 transparent; height:43px; margin-bottom:10px;}.NavSpace { background:url('../assets/design/images/NavSpacer.jpg'); float:left; width:2px; height:100%;}/*------------------------------------*\ NAV\*------------------------------------*/#nav{ float:left; width:100%; list-style:none; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:10px;}#nav li{ float:left; margin-right:10px; position:relative; display:block;}a.MainNavButton{ /*Main Buttons */ text-transform:uppercase; font-family:verdana; font-weight:bold; font-size:11px; text-align:center; text-shadow:1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.75); /* Text shadow to lift it a little */ color:#fff; display:block; padding:12px 21px 16px 21px ; /* TOP LEFT Bottom RIGHT */ -moz-border-radius:2px; -webkit-border-radius:2px; border-radius:2px;}#nav li a:hover{ color:#fff; background:#444444; /* Solid colour fall-back */ text-decoration:underline;}/*--- DROPDOWN ---*//* * <div class=""SubNavWrapper""> <div class=""SubNav""> <div class=""SubNavSectionWrapper""> <h5>List 1</h5> <ul class=""SubNavSectionList""> <li><a href=""#"">The product</a></li> <li><a href=""#"">Meet the team</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class=""SubNavSectionWrapper""> <h5>List 2</h5> <ul class=""SubNavSectionList""> <li><a href=""#"">The product</a></li> <li><a href=""#"">Meet the team</a></li> </ul> </div> </div></div><!-- END Nav Pad-->*/div.SubNavWrapper { float:left; padding:30px; padding-top:0px; position:absolute; background:transparent; left:-9999px; /* Hide off-screen when not needed (this is more accessible than display:none;) */}div.SubNav { float:left; clear:both; padding:30px; border:1px solid #222; border-top:none; background:#444;}div.SubNavSectionWrapper { float:left; width:150px; height:200px; margin-right:45px;}div.SubNavSectionTitle { /* Title of a sub-section */text-transform:uppercase;font-family:verdana;font-weight:bold;font-size:11px;padding-bottom:3px;margin-bottom:3px;border-bottom:1px solid #333;color:#fff; }ul.SubNavSectionList { list-style:none;}ul.SubNavSectionList li{ padding-top:1px; /* Introducing a padding between the li and the a give the illusion spaced items */}ul.SubNavSectionList li a { /* Sub Menu Links */font-family:verdana;font-weight:bold;font-size:11px;color:#fff;padding:4px 0px;}ul.SubNavSectionList a{ white-space:nowrap; /* Stop text wrapping and creating multi-line dropdown items */ display:block;}#nav li:hover div.SubNavWrapper{ /* Display the dropdown on hover */ left:-30px; /* Bring back on-screen when needed */ /* must match SubNavWrapper!!

html5: titles in sectioning elements," The html5 spec says that: The outline for a sectioning content element or a sectioning root element consists of a list of one or more potentially nested sections. A section is a container that corresponds to some nodes in the original DOM tree. Each section can have one heading associated with it, and can contain any number of further nested sections. The algorithm for the outline also associates each node in the DOM tree with a particular section and potentially a heading.and the same reasoning seems applied to the html5 document outline algorithm.I've been checking my site's outline using the HTML5 outliner (h5o) [link] tool but am having difficulty achieving a clear outline that isn't overburdened with useless titles, because of the fact that elements such as <nav> or <footer> will appear in your outline but will do so as 'untitled' unless you give them an explicit h1-h6 heading.This seems frankly overkill for things like navigation or footers.One solution is to replace these elements with divs, but that seems to defeat the whole purpose of using html5.Another, which I've tentatively tried on my site [link], is to set headings for all sectioning elements and then use CSS to hide the headings for some of them (again, basically <nav> and <footer>, as well as some <section> elements. Here's an example: This results in a nicely-diplaying site, but the issue I see with it is Google ranking. In its Webmasters Tool help item [link] on 'hidden text and links', Google clearly states that: Hiding text or links in your content can cause your site to be perceived as untrustworthy since it presents information to search engines differently than to visitors. Text (such as excessive keywords) can be hidden in several ways, including: [] Using CSS to hide textSome people might feel that whether Google likes the fact they use hidden text or not is immaterial, but most of my visitors come from Google searches and I'd rather not be penalized as a result of choosing to go with this setup.Can anyone offer advice on the subject? <code>  <nav id=""content-nav""> <h2 class=""hidden"">Post navigation</h2> <ul> <li class=""alignleft""><?php next_post_link('&#8592; <strong>Next Post</strong><br />%link') ?></li> <li class=""alignright""><?php previous_post_link('<strong>Previous Post</strong> &#8594;<br />%link') ?></li> </ul></nav>",html5: titles in sectioning elements - document outline and SEO implications

Opening a new link in a specific browser," I have designed a website using Firefox and am now looking to integrate a softphone into the webpage, but unfortunately it is made with ActiveX, so Firefox won't support it.I have tried opening my page in IE9, and it looks a mess because I've used CSS3 for a lot of it and haven't coded it for different browsers because we will only be using Firefox within the office.Is there a way that I can tell my page in Firefox to specifically open a new page in Internet Explorer and just have the softphone in there?

Html5 Canvas vs SVG vs div," What is the best approach for creating elements on the fly and being able to move them around? For example, let's say I want to create a rectangle, circle and polygon and then select those objects and move them around.I understand that HTML5 provides three elements that can make this possible: svg, canvas and div. For what I want to do, which one of those elements will provide the best performance?To compare these approaches, I was thinking of creating three visually identical web pages that each have a header, footer, widget and text content in them. The widget in the first page would be created entirely with the canvas element, the second entirely with the svg element, and the third with the plain div element, HTML and CSS. <code> ",HTML5 Canvas vs. SVG vs. div

No keyboard switchers or anything like it is running. Also I'm using Git for version control, but I didn't pulled that code, so it is very unlikely that Git is to blame. It can't be a stupid joke of my colleagues, because they are quite well-mannered.Any suggestions who messed up my code? <code>  var element = '<input size=""3"" id=""foo"" name=""elements[foo][0]"" />';$('#bar').append(element); <input id=""&quot;3&quot;"" name=""&quot;elements[foo][0]&quot;"" size=""&quot;foo&quot;"" /> '<input size=\u200b""3"" id=\u200b""foo"" name=\u200b""elements[foo]\u200b[0]"" />\u200b'",\u200b (Zero width space) characters in my JS code.

jQuery sometimes does not work when being used in complex code," Simple answer:The jQuery library my code base was using was out of date. If yours is up to date try the following:Step though the unminified version of jQuery to see if the issue is inside the library (which 9 times out of 10 it probably will not be)When all else fails, just write a pure javascript solution.Sometimes when I am writing a ""class"" in javscript with jQuery, jQuery will just not function as it should. For example today I was doing the following on an input select:$(this).val(newValue);This was working in jFiddle just fine, but not working in my project (both had 0 script errors). I tried to isolate the code as much as possible, but to no avail I could not get it to work.The ""solution"" for this was to just write straight up javascript to set the value and it worked just fine. I am not a jQuery master, but this is not the first time I had to write a straight javascript solution when jQuery ""failed."" Do any jQuery masters out there know why something like this might happen? Is there a method of debugging jQuery I am not aware of? Does anyone else run into these types of problems with jQuery? If so, do you have a solution?Update(s):Aug 25, 2011I downloaded the most recent version of the jQuery library and stepped through it only to find that the bug was probably resolved between jQuery 1.4.4 and 1.6.2. I didn't realize the person who handles most of the javascript wasn't keeping the jQuery library up to date. After stepping through the jQuery 1.4.4 library it seems that jQuery was not able to find my selector for some reason and therefore was never setting the value.

Aug 16, 2011As for the current answers, I don't think it is a conflict. jQuery is working just fine. The binds are triggering causing the functions to be called in both implementations.

I will post my findings as to why it didn't work later.Aug 24, 2011I agree with the user Sohnee that having a duplicate 'name' isn't bad practice and in some places you actually need it. I feel rather stupid because the posted code has been wrong for almost a week now. I have updated the code. I moved the init function to the public scope.Aug 22, 2011While I am partially satisfied that the core of the problem is with duplicate names, I need to know why are duplicate names bad?I know when dealing with inputs/css/etc you usually except IDs to be unique and classes to represent groups. I didn't think there were any rules about names, but if someone can explain to me why having duplicate names is bad practice, I will consider that the answer to this problem. Aug 16, 2011As for the current answers, I don't think it is a conflict. jQuery is working just fine. The binds are triggering causing the functions to be called in both implementations. The problem line is For example, if I console out newVal in the .each() it will have a value of lets say 'A'.Then if I console log out $(this).val() it will be 'B'. Then $(this).val(newVal); is run. After that if I do a console log of $(this).val() it will still be 'B'.In the comments someone mentioned that I might be using the word this wrong. Both of these returned 0 javascript errors on Chrome's console. I will give the following code snippet was what was having problems. I will write the original and then what I replaced it with javascript.I am aware the name is the same, but that is ok. The page I am working on is a huge form and the cloned select is just to make the user not have to scroll back to another part of the form.HTML: jQuery (this does not work): Javascript (this works): <code>  $(overrideSelector).each( function(){ $(this).val(newVal); }); <div id='overrideHolder'></div><select name='mySelect'> <option value='A'>A</option> <option value='B'>B</option></select> var someClass = (function(){ var overrideSelector = '[name=""mySelect""]'; ... return{ init : function(){ $(overrideSelector).clone().appendTo('#overrideHolder'); $(overrideSelector).each( function(){ $(this).bind( 'change', {}, function(){ someClass.overrideTryAgain(this); } ); } ); } overrideTryAgain : function(element){ var newVal = $(element).val(); $(overrideSelector).each( function(){ $(this).val(newVal); } ); ... }, ... } })();$(document).ready(function(){ someClass.init();} var someClass : (function(){ var overrideSelector = '[name=""mySelect""]'; ... return{ init : function(){ $(overrideSelector).clone().appendTo('#overrideHolder'); $(overrideSelector).each( function(){ $(this).bind( 'change', {}, function(){ someClass.overrideTryAgain(this); } ); } ); } overrideTryAgain : function(element){ // NOTE: Using javascript instead of jQuery because jQuery was not duplicating the selected value properly var newValue = $(element).get(0); newValue = newValue.selectedIndex; $(overrideSelector).each( function(){ var currentSelect = $(this).get(0); currentSelect.options[newValue].selected = true; } ); ... }, ... }})();...$(document).ready(function(){ someClass.init();}",jQuery cannot change a value where JS can because the library is out of date
Css formating cursive word breaks it," From wikipedia: Cursive (from Latin curro, currere, cucurri, cursum, to run, hasten) is any style of handwriting that is designed for writing notes and letters quickly by hand. In the Arabic, Latin, and Cyrillic writing systems, the letters in a word are connected, making a word one single complex stroke.In the above languages when we want to format one single word with e.g. <span> tag to apply custom css style it breaks word conection, so is there any solution for this.example this is for example normal arabic word: but when we want to color last letter in other color using the span tag get this: because first two letter are in one tag and last is in other to color it.Is there something I can do to avoid word breaks.Here is the full html: <code>  <p><span style=""color: Red;""></span></p>",Inserting HTML tag in the middle of Arabic word breaks word connection (cursive)
HTML5 Shared Worker eats memory in Chrome," I have a web page that starts a HTML5 SharedWorker script. Chrome memory usage increases every time this page is reloaded (hitting F5).The worker script is very simple. Every second (using setInterval) a message is sent to the connected port.It seems like the worker process is terminated and restarted each time I hit F5. This is what I'd expect since the worker isn't actually shared by more than one 'document'. However, I cannot figure out why memory usage increases on every refresh.Does anybody know why this is happening?Given that memory increases each time the page is reloaded makes me think that I cannot use shared workers at all in Chrome. Has anyone been able to do so without having memory problems?UPDATEThis is the hosting HTML: ...and this is worker.js: The hosting page starts/connects to a shared worker and outputs whatever is received from it.The worker code keeps a list of connected ports and sends a message to them all once a second.This is simple stuff. Yet, each time the hosting page is reloaded in Chrome. Memory payload for that tab is increased.The following shows Chrome's memory usage after a couple of refreshes:...after refreshing some more I'm reaching 250 MB...I'm running out of ideas, thinking this must be a bug in Chrome. Can anyone give me some sort of pointer?UPDATE 2Disabling my AdBlock extension seemed to fix the problem:So I was happy for a little while but it turned out that memory is still being leaked. With AdBlock disabled it's just leaking quite a bit less per page refresh. <code>  <div id=""output""></div><script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/scripts/jquery-1.4.4.js""></script><script type=""text/javascript"">$(function () { var worker = new SharedWorker(""/scripts/worker.js"") worker.port.onmessage = function(e) { $(""#output"").append($(""<div></div>"").text(e.data)); }; worker.port.start();});</script> var list = [];setInterval(function () { for (var i = 0; i < list.length; ++i) { list[i].postMessage(""#connections = "" + list.length); }}, 1000);onconnect = function (event) { list.push(event.ports[0]);}; ",Memory leakage in Chrome using Shared Worker?

in javascript html5 INPUT type='number' - distinguish between focus and value-change mouse clicks," In the HTML5 INPUT type='number' the user can change the value by clicking on up/down arrows that are part of the INPUT box. The user might also click in the box for focus or for editing its contents.Is there any easy way to distinguish between these two activities in the click trigger?from @cvsguimaraes answer, which better demonstrates the theory.using his methodology, here is my finished(?) version. the purpose: make sure regular change triggers are called when using +/- to change data. on chrome it's working flawlessly so far except that when you remove focus from the ITEM the change trigger will kick in again. I solved this by having a low level change trigger that stops propagation if the previous change call was from the mouseup. <code>  // input/mouseup triggers to call change from +/- mouse clicks// want to wait 500ms before calling change in case successive clicksrender.inputCh = false;render.inputCt = 0;render.inputFn = function(e) { render.inputCh = true;}render.mouseupFn = function(e) { if( render.inputCh ) { render.inputCh = false; render.inputCt++; setTimeout( next, 500 ); } function next() { render.inputCt--; if( render.inputCt ) return; var change = document.createEvent(""Event""); change.initEvent('change',true,true); e.target.dispatchEvent(change); }}// using input/mouseup triggersdocument.getElementById('number').addListener('input',render.inputFn,true);document.getElementById('number').addListener('mouseup',render.mouseuptFn,true);// normal change trigger - will be called normally and via +/- mouse clickdocument.getElementById('number').addListener('change',changeFn,false);",HTML5 INPUT type='number' - distinguish between focus and value-change mouse clicks

Working With Canvas In Different Screen Sizes," I'm planing to create a simple game using the HTML5 <canvas> tag and compile the code into a native application using Phonegap, but the problem is that canvas use coordinates that are not relative to the size of it, so 20,20 on a 960x640 screen is different on a 480x800 one.So I want to know how to work with a <canvas> (which will be in fullscreen) on different screen sizes. <code> ",Working with canvas in different screen sizes
CSS: selecting a class and first 3 of the rest; nth-child and nth-of-type useless," I have a DOM element (#installations) with a number of children, only one of them has a class .selected. I need to select this class and the first 3 of the rest (:not(.selected)) and show them - the goal is to have only 4 elements shown, regardless of which element has the class .selected.The problem is, in the expression: :nth-of-type() disregards the :not() selector and just selects the first 3 children of #installation. For example, if I have this HTML: I will only have one, two, three selected and not the first four. The logical implication is that :nth-of-type() will have only (one, two, four, five) to select from, since :not() already excluded the selected one, thus selecting (one, two, four), and then the other part of the selector , .selected will add the selected element. If .selected is not in the first four elements, let's say it's the sixth, we will have the first three + sixth elements selected.To clarify: selecting .selected plus 3 adjacent elements is also fine. However, I this is also difficult in case .selected is in the last 3 (if we select the next 3 adjacent elements)  <code>  #installations > *:not(.selected):nth-of-type(-n+3), .selected <div id=""installations""> <div id=""one""/> <div id=""two""/> <div id=""three"" class=""selected""/> <div id=""four""/> <div id=""five""/></div>",Selecting a class and first 3 of the rest; nth-child and nth-of-type useless

SVG: SVG element appears to have arbitrary height, I've been really trying to learn some SVG. But browsers seem to get in a right old muddle rendering it.Take the following HTML: View this is any modern browser and you'll see an arbitrary amount of whitespace between the rectangle and the following HTML paragraph. (IE9 doesn't display anything but noone will be surprised about that.)Firefox (Firebug) doesn't give the heights of either the svg or the rect elements. It just wimps out and says 'auto'.Opera says the svg has a height of 150px and says 'auto' for the rect.Chrome mans up and gives heights for both. 102px for the rect (obviously including the stroke) and 428px for the svg.My expectation is that the svg element would be a 'thin' container (i.e. add nothing to the dimensions of its contents) and therefore have a height of 102px.Anyone know what the correct behaviour should be and how I might go about fixing this? <code>  <html> <head></head>,SVG element appears to have arbitrary height

Programatically create image from web-page or a single DIV," Is there any way to programmatically create (client or server side (PHP)) a image from a specific DIV or a complete (web) page? I'm currently creating a web-site for free coupons and the idea is when the end-user clicks on the ""Print"" button, the app opens a new tab/window with all the selected coupons as a single image (JPG, PNG or etc..) in A4 format ready for printing. Each coupons has it's own data (Article name, price, description etc..) so I need it to be done programmatically over a coupon-template I designed. I do not ask you to write code for me, just to suggest a solution I could use/develop. If not already exist, I will upload/publish it for free :) Update: I did it with the PHP GD library :) Still not satisfied with the idea to use Images instead of PDF, because each printing results with different Coupon sizes (images) on different PC's. That's why PDF may would be a better solution. You can see/test it on demo.svikuponi.ba - Just select a few Coupons and click the PRINTAJ button above. <code> ",Programmatically create image from web-page or a single DIV

Is it possible to POST an array from an HTML form without javascript, I have a form that is a little complex and I am hoping to simplify the server-side (PHP) processing by natively POSTing an array of tuples.The first part of the form represents a User:First NameLast NameEmailAddressetcThe second part of the form represents a Tree:FruitHeightetcThe problem is that I need to be able to POST multiple Trees for a single User in the same form. I would like to send the information as a single User with an array of Trees but this might be too complex to do with a form. The only thing that comes to mind is using javascript to create some JSON message with a User object and an array of Tree objects. But it would be nice to avoid javascript to support more users (some people have scripts turned off). <code> ,POST an array from an HTML form without javascript
How to prevent users from accessing application from Desktop shortcut (saved page)," I have a web application which is used by lots of non-technical users. I have found that several of these users are saving the login page of the application to their desktops (which also saves the associated CSS and JS files). Then, to start using the application, they double click on that desktop icon which shows the local copy using the file:// protocol. This can cause problems later on, e.g. if I change the login form, or the URL it posts to, etc. Also, certain javascript utilities, e.g. PIE.htc don't work using the file:// protocol.Obviously what they should be doing is saving a browser bookmark/favorite, I'm looking for a way of detecting and warning those users without confusing the rest. I have been using some javascript to warn these users: But this will only warn users that have saved the desktop copy since I have added this piece of javascript. Has anyone else had this problem and come up with clever solutions that they'd like to share?ThanksUpdate:In the end I decided to do this by setting a cookie with a nonce value upon login page request, and storing the same value as a hidden field in the form. Then, in the form submit handler, check that the two are the same and show an error message if not. One could store the nonce in a session instead of a cookie, but I don't want to create unnecessary sessions.If the user has saved the login page locally, they will likely have different nonce values in the saved form compared to the cookie (if they have a cookie at all).Normally one wouldn't add CSRF protection (that's sort of what this is) to a login form, but it fulfills my requirements. I read about this technique on The Register, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/02/google_web_attack_protection/, Google implemented similar protection for their login forms, to protect against forging of login requests, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Forging_login_requests.  <code>  if (top.location.protocol == 'file:') { alert('This application is not designed to be accessed from a desktop copy...')}",How to prevent users from accessing a web application from a locally saved Html login page?

What is overflow hidden actually doing here?," A common problem that I have with web pages is floating div tags creeping outside of their containers, like shown in the snippet.

I am happy, but I have no idea WHY it works this way?All the documentation, I had looked at, indicates overflow:hidden is for hiding content, not resizing a parent to fit its children...Can anybody offer a explanation for this behavior?ThanksOriginal snippets:Live example 1: http://jsfiddle.net/ugUVa/1/Live example 2: http://jsfiddle.net/ugUVa/2/ <code>  #wrapper { border: 1px solid red;}#wrapper div { float: left; font-size: 3em;} <div id=""wrapper""> <div>Hello World</div></div> #wrapper { border: 1px solid red; overflow: hidden;}#wrapper div { float: left; font-size: 3em;} <div id=""wrapper""> <div>Hello World</div></div>",Why does overflow hidden stop floating elements escaping their container?

Are floats bad? What should be used in its place," I've made the jump from HTML table layout for designing webpages to CSS about a week ago and have since been reading more about it. Yesterday, I read a long post here on Stack overflow where users were knocking float and how deprecated they are for layout. There was a lot of talk about inline-block being used in its place.I have an HTML5 design that I just finished and it looks fantastic in Firefox and Chrome, but when tested in Internet Explorer 7, 8, and 9, the design absolutely explodes. It seems to me that anything in this design that I've floated right is not honored in IE. It just seems to wrap under whatever is to the left of it.I'd like to know if I'm OK with floats or if I should I be using inline-block instead.

For example, if you had a dynamically generated list of items for a user to select from by speech, how would you specify that what they will say will most likely be one of those items? P.S. I am testing this with Google Chrome, thus using the x-webkit-speech attribute instead of speech and likewise x-webkit-grammar instead of grammar.  <code> ",HTML5 Speech recognition --- is there a way to set what the user is expected to say dynamically?

How can I achieve this pseudo-vertical centered layout using only CSS?," OVERVIEWI've read a bunch of the ""vertical-centering with CSS"" tutorials out there:http://emergentweb.com/test/valign.htmlhttp://blog.themeforest.net/tutorials/vertical-centering-with-css/http://www.jakpsatweb.cz/css/css-vertical-center-solution.htmlhttp://www.alistapart.com/d/footers/footer_variation1.htmlhttp://phrogz.net/css/vertical-align/index.html... but there is another component to my layout that is not represented in any of these methods in addition to the vertical centering..There are 2 components to this layout. First, vertically & horizontally centering the content between the header and footer (which is a sticky footer). I have the code in a fiddle to demonstrate but I haven't been able to get this to work in IE (the code is at the bottom of the post).http://jsfiddle.net/UnsungHero97/yZPwu/4/embedded/result/The second component is where the green arrow is pointing. That represents a hidden element which is meant to expand vertically downwards when clicking on some of the text. However, I DO NOT WANT this expansion to move the content upward as if everything was being centered... I want this element to expand downwards without affecting the position of the content AND pushing the sticky footer down as it expands. In most cases, a browser scrollbar will appear.So the effect of the hidden element expanding should be like a banner falling off an edge. This is what the layout should look like after the hidden element has been expanded:QUESTIONSo how would I achieve this layout using only CSS and have it be cross-browser compatible Please let me know if I need to explain further to clarify confusion.CODE SO FARNote...

The above is what I'm reading from W3C and from wikipedia but Head First HTML5 Programming (Freeman & Robinson) describes LocalStorage in depth, then has Web Storage (with info on Cache Manifest) in the appendix (""things we aren't covering).Am I understanding this correctly? <code> ",Is AppCache = Application Cache = Web Storage's LocalStorage?

How does PHP interact with HTML and vice versus?," I'm learning how the internet and websites work. I think I understand how .php files get processed by the PHP processor:Browser requests webpage ending in .php and sends request to server for that webpage.Server asks 'can I find that page?'If server does not find it, server sends back error.If server finds page, server asks 'does file extension end in .html or .php'?If it ends in .html, server send page back to browser.If it ends in .php, hand page to PHP processor.PHP processor scans the page, line by line. It build a processed HTML page.If it finds HTML, it passes that on as part of the processed HTML page it is building.If it finds PHP scripts, the PHP processor may or may not output HTML.When the PHP processor is done, the processed page is handed to the web server for sending to the browser.Does HTML still provide structure to a .php file, the same way HTML provides structure to a webpage that also uses CSS? When I say structure I mean divisions, and head and body sections. Structure as in the bare bones skeleton of the webpage. It seems that on some web pages, there's more PHP than there is HTML. Sometimes there's the bare minimum HTML, and the rest is PHP and Javascript, is this the way webpages were made to be?In summary, a web page that has PHP code in it needs be have a .php extension. Once the PHP processor encounters <? PHP or <?, the server sends the code to the PHP processor (this wording is probably redundant). The output of the PHP processor can be anything. Anything includes:CssHTMLJavascript?XML?XHTML?ImagesSound?Video?Animations such as flash? Apparently forcing content type may be needed, but it can be done.HTML is WYSIWYG. To control and manipulate a web page after it has reached the user's browser, Javascript can be used. With the advent of mobile devices and a few different types of browsers, jQuery was invented to make the developing Javascript programs easier. <code> ",How does PHP interact with HTML and vice versa?

What does idl attribute mean in the WHATWG html5 stasndard document?," While reading over the WHATWG's HTML5 - A technical specification for Web developers I see many references such as: Reflecting content attributes in IDL attributes Some IDL attributes are defined to reflect a particular content attribute. This means that on getting, the IDL attribute returns the current value of the content attribute, and on setting, the IDL attribute changes the value of the content attribute to the given value.and: In conforming documents, there is only one body element. The document.body IDL attribute provides scripts with easy access to a document's body element. The body element exposes as event handler content attributes a number of the event handlers of the Window object. It also mirrors their event handler IDL attributes.My (admittedly fuzzy) understanding comes from the Windows world. I think an .idl file is used to map remote procedure calls in an n-tier distributed app. I would assume a content attribute refers to html element attributes.There is no place in the standard that I can see that explains this usage of the terms ""content attribute"" and ""IDL attribute"". Could anyone explain what these terms mean and how the two kinds of attributes relate? <code> ",What does idl attribute mean in the WHATWG html5 standard document?

Button visible text different than value submitted in query string," Short version: How can I have my form's button label text differ from the value submitted to the server without using the <button> tag?Long version:I wanted to have the text that appeared in a button in a form to be different than the value submitted in the query string. So, I looked around, and came across this approach... ...and that worked on IE9 on one of my laptops and I was happy. The user saw ""Update Config"" and the server received method=repackage in the query string.Then I brought this app to work and ran it on a workstation, also with IE9. But something had gone wrong. The user still saw ""Update Config"", but the server now received method=Update%20Config in the query string.So I investigated some more. I found that www.w3schools.com recommmended not using a <button> tag in a form. They say: ""If you use the <button> element in an HTML form, different browsers may submit different values. Use <input> to create buttons in an HTML form"" in this article. This seems to be what I am experiencing.So I looked some more, and found lots of conflicting information about the right way to do this.

One solution could possibly be to open the links externally with: but then again there is still the problem of lack of selectors.Update: When clicking the button while on the license page or in Google maps I get the following error message in logcat: 11-13 16:20:30.500: E/Web Console(31508): Uncaught ReferenceError: cordova is not defined:1 <code>  document.addEventListener(""backbutton"", function(e){ history.back();} navigator.app.loadUrl([href here], { openExternal:true } );",Cordova Phonegap and Google Maps v3 javascript api: How to add backbutton functionality when clicking either the license link or the Google maps logo

CSS margin terror; Margin adds space outside parent element," My css margins doesn't behave the way I want or expect them to. I seems like my header margin-top affect the div-tags surrounding it.This is what I want and expect:...but this is what I end up with:Source: I have exaggerated the margin in this example. Default browser margin on h1-tag is somewhat smaller, and in my case I use Twitter Bootstrap, with Normalizer.css which sets default margin to 10px. Not that important, main point is; I can not, should not, want not change the margin on the h1-tag.I guess it is similar to my other question; Why does this CSS margin-top style not work?. Question is how do I solve this specific issue?I have read a few threads on similar problems, but haven't found any real answers and solutions. I know adding padding:1px; or border:1px; solves the problem. But that only adds new problems, since I do not want a padding nor a border on my div-tags.There must be a better, best practice, solution?

I know this is possible with delegates and that's probably the best way to go, but just play along here. This example is purely hypothetical just for the sake of proposing the question.So the hypothetical situation is this:I'm writing a javascript validation library that has javascript events tied to input fields via inline HTML attributes like so: But, I'd like to make the library a little better by unbinding my events, so that people working with this library in a single-page application don't have to manage my event handlers and so that they don't have to clutter their code at all by wiring up input events to functions in my hypothetical validation library... whatever. None of that's true, but it seems like a decent usecase.Here's the ""sample"" code of Hypothetical Validation Library.js: http://jsfiddle.net/CoryDanielson/jwTTf/To test, just type in the textbox and then click elsewhere to fire the change event. Do this with the web inspector open and recording on the Timeline tab. Highlight the region of the timeline that correlates to when you've fired the change event (fire the change event multiple times) and you'll see the event listeners (in the window below) increase by 100 on each change event. If managed & removed properly, each event listener would be properly removed before rendering a new input, but I have not found a way to properly do that with inline javascript events.What that code does is this:onChange, the input element triggers a validation functionThat function validates the input and colors the border if successfulThen after 1 second (to demonstrate the memory leak) the input element is replaced with identical HTML 100 times in a row without unbinding the change event (because I don't know how to do that.. that's the problem here). This simulates changing the view within a single-page app. This creates 100 new eventListeners in the DOM, which is visible through the web inspector.Interesting Note. $('input').removeAttr('onchange'); will actually prevent the onchange event from being fired in the future, but does not garbage collect the eventListener/DOM stuff that is visible in the web inspector.This screenshot is after change event fires 3 times. Each time, 100 new DOM nodes are rendered with identical HTML and I've attempted to unbind the onchange event from each node before replacing the HTML.Update: I came back to this question and just did a quick little test using the JSFiddle to make sure that the answer was valid.

If managed & removed properly, each event listener would be properly removed before rendering a new input, but I have not found a way to properly do that with inline javascript events.What that code does is this:onChange, the input element triggers a validation functionThat function validates the input and colors the border if successfulThen after 1 second (to demonstrate the memory leak) the input element is replaced with identical HTML 100 times in a row without unbinding the change event (because I don't know how to do that.. that's the problem here). This simulates changing the view within a single-page app. This creates 100 new eventListeners in the DOM, which is visible through the web inspector.Interesting Note. $('input').removeAttr('onchange'); will actually prevent the onchange event from being fired in the future, but does not garbage collect the eventListener/DOM stuff that is visible in the web inspector.This screenshot is after change event fires 3 times. Each time, 100 new DOM nodes are rendered with identical HTML and I've attempted to unbind the onchange event from each node before replacing the HTML.Update: I came back to this question and just did a quick little test using the JSFiddle to make sure that the answer was valid. I ran the 'test' dozens of times and then waited -- sure enough, the GC came through and took care of business. <code>  <input type=""text"" onchange=""validateString(this)""></input> <input type=""text"" onchange=""validateString(this)""></input>",Unbind inline javascript events from HTML elements in memory

iOS Phonegap text select bug?," I am creating a Phonegap app that requires the user to select text inside a p element, and then ""copy"" the text which modifies it to me needs.There is a problem, however, with selecting text inside the p tag. The text is retrieved from my server where it is outputted like so: This will alow the text to retain the line breaks without me using <br/> tags, which do not currently work within my Javascript.Anyways, when you try to select text in this element, the entire p element is selected instead. Here's the transition of what happens when you select a word, then move the bounds to select more text:NOTE: The text is different in the first sequence because I took the screenshot with different text, but the effect is still the same.I can't provide a jsFiddle for this as it seems to be only replicated in Phonegap, but I've uploaded my source to test: http://cl.ly/2w0O1d3l3h17There is no JS in the project, but the HTML and CSS look like this:HTML: CSS: One potential solution that I've found is to use contenteditable=""true"" on the p element, but this has some downfalls:I can't allow for more tags to be created within the elementI can't have the keyboard showingAnother solution I've found is to remove the pre formatting.

How to programatically scroll an HTML element?," I am trying to create a web page that has a table of elements that the user can select from. The number of elements could be as small as a single element but also grow as large as about 120. I don't want the table to stretch down the page, so I'm stuffing it into its own <div> tag with a defined height and a vertical scroll bar. A bare-bones example: In this example, the table is in a vertically-scrolling area and the active item is the last one in the table. So far so good.My question is: When updating this table, how can I set it so that it automatically scrolls to the end? E.g., when the page is created, it's supposed to select element #9 automatically; the UI should already highlight that item in the list and that means automatically setting the scrollbar to the end.I don't see a way to do it with the <div> tag (though I may be missing something). Do I need to use an <iframe> tag some how? I figure that if each line of the table has an anchor tag, then the scroll position could be set that way. I'm not completely sure how to do that, though, so I thought I would ask.I know there are probably data table plugins I can use to do this (I was using YUI previously, and I never figured out if it could solve this particular problem). But this seems simple enough that I don't feel I should need to import any plugin that could easily be used as an entire in-browser spreadsheet. <code>  <div style=""width:100px; height:100px; overflow-y:scroll; overflow-x:hidden;""> <table> <tr><td>item 1</td></tr> <tr><td>item 2</td></tr> <tr><td>item 3</td></tr> <tr><td>item 4</td></tr> <tr><td>item 5</td></tr> <tr><td>item 6</td></tr> <tr><td>item 7</td></tr> <tr><td>item 8</td></tr> <tr style=""color:#00aa00""><td>item 9</td></tr> </table></div>",How to programmatically scroll an HTML element?
CSS Horizontal list items," So, I have attempted to create a horizontal list for use on a new website I am designing.

Appropriate way to hide icons from screen readers," In my web application, I have made myself a font that consists solely of icons. I use these icons to complement titles and sub titles within the application and make it more visually appealing.However, screen readers like JAWS read this out and it makes for an unpleasant experience for users of screen readers.For instance the character c displays an image of a cloud. I use it in this way to complement for instance a header such as <h1>:<span class=""my-font"">c</span>Now I would like for screen readers to completely ignore this as this is just complementing an existing title and not adding any new meaning to what's on the page. Through my research I have found two possibilities:aria-hidden=""true"" or role=""presentation""I'm just not sure which one of these (or perhaps both) are suitable to what I am trying to achieve. <code> ",What is the appropriate way to hide icons from screen readers

angular ng-href and svg xlink," I'd like some input on using xml namespaced attributes with angular.The problem is angular comes with a couple of directives to handle writing attributes such as href and src when angular has parsed the expresssions (otherwise the browser will try to load {{mymodel.myimage}} as a url)https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/directive/booleanAttrs.js#L329The problem I'm facing is that I'm using angular to output svg together with D3 and since angular doesn't have a way to output xlink:href I was stuck.I created a custom directive that outputs xlink:href Full demo: http://plnkr.co/edit/cMhGRhBut it seems that if I don't manually add xlink:href to the element, the svg image will not render.Any suggestions on how to best handle xml namespaces / svg together with angular would be greatly appreciated. <code>  app.directive('ngXlinkHref', function () { return { priority: 99, restrict: 'A', link: function (scope, element, attr) { var attrName = 'xlink:href'; attr.$observe('ngXlinkHref', function (value) { if (!value) return; attr.$set(attrName, value); }); } };});",AngularJS ng-href and svg xlink

Basic authentication programatically in REST in case of HTML5-client," Environment:JAVAGlassfishREST-services in different machineHTML5-client withAJAX and JQueryJerseyThis is what I have implemented so far:HTML5-client SERVERIn Security, I haven't got Security Manager enabled, it is disabled!I have configured BASIC-authentication to Glassfish and my web.xml looks like that: GLASSFISHLOG QUESTION:If I encrypt (NOT encode) password in client when user is signing up and transfer it under the SSL/HTTPS, is this secure and good way to implement this?If I use REST-service without client, it is always open, WHY? No BASIC-authentication? Have I understood something wrong with those url-patterns? IF I get this working how to test that, because now if I authenticate once, I am authorised always? Is it possible to ""log out"" programatically inside the REST-service or in generally how to implement Log out?When using Authorization in header with mandatory base64-encoded username:password do I have to encode my username and password to DB as well? I tried that and added Encoding (allowed values are Hex and Base64) to jdbcRealm to Glassfish and it seems that password is enough, but what happens when both are encoded in client?UPDATE: I changed web.xml and now BASIC-authentication is working when calling REST-service straight in browser :http://localhost:8080/SesameService/users/secured/loginChanges:I enabled security manager in GlassfishI changed url-pattern I changed the url to service to this: http://localhost:8080/SesameService/users/secured/loginNow I get a HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized when trying to authenticate from HTML5-client.Request headers: Response: UPDATE 2When I try to authenticate with JavaScript + Authorization-header I got 401 error and that in the log: UPDATE 3I can't be the first and only person who is trying to authenticate using BASIC in cross domain case.I changed my cross origin filters like that: NO 401 error anymore but still error in JavaScript. IN Glassfish log: BTW, because I have never get this work, does this work same way than calling the REST-service direct in its own domain. So, First client requests, server requests and username-password window opens, then client request and server authenticate and response the page? I am trying to get it: Request with Authorization header in it, response from server with result from the rest service and that's it. Any idea how to secure REST-services? Easier than that? This is impossible.UPDATE 4I just tried to move my HTML5-client to under java web-project, just pure html-pages and under same domain and BASIC-authentication is working 100 %. So the reason is because of cross-domain environment. <code>  $('#btnSignIn').click(function () { var username = $(""#username"").val(); var password = $(""#password"").val(); function make_base_auth(user, password) { var tok = user + ':' + password; var final = ""Basic "" + $.base64.encode(tok); console.log(""FINAL---->"" + final); alert(""FINAL---->"" + final); return final; } $.ajax({ type: ""GET"", contentType: ""application/json"", url: ""http://localhost:8080/SesameService/webresources/users/secured/login"", crossDomain: true, dataType: ""text"", async: false, data: {}, beforeSend: function (xhr) { xhr.setRequestHeader('authorization', make_base_auth(username, password)); }, success: function () { alert('Thanks for your signin in!

I could loop through all the models but that seems inefficient.Again in the render method, how do I get the model that belongs to this view?In the render method, how can I only render the pig view the event was on, and not render all the pigs?Maybe I'm going for a total wrong approach over here.

Bootstrap 3: understanding the grid classes ( col-sm-# and col-lg-# )," I'm getting started on Bootstrap 3 and I'm having some trouble understanding how the grid classes are meant to be used.Here's what I've figured out so far: It appears that the classes col-sm-# and col-lg-# differ from plain old col-# in that they will only apply when screens are above a certain size (768px and 992px respectively). If you omit the -sm- or -lg- the divs will never collapse into one column.However, when I create two divs inside a row that are both col-sm-6 it seems they are only side by side when the window is between 768px and 992px wide. In other words, if I shrink the window all the way down and then slowly widen it, the layout is single column, then two columns, then back to single column again.Is this the intended behavior?If I want two columns for anything over 768px, should I apply both classes?

Reformatting poorly formatted html tables with beautifulsoup in python," I am currently using Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape some website data. I'm trying to pull cells from a table which is formatted like so: The problem with the above HTML is that BeautifulSoup reads it as one tag. I need to pull the values from the first <td> and the third <td>, which would be 1 and 20, respectively. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to go about this. How can I get BeautifulSoup to read the 1st and 3rd <td> tags of each row of the table?Update:I figured out the problem. I was using html.parser instead of the default for BeautifulSoup. Once I switched to the default the problems went away. Also I used the method listed in the answer. I also found out that the different parsers are very temperamental with broken code. For instance, the default parser refused to read past row 192, but html5lib got the job done.So try using lxml, html, and also html5lib if you are having problems parsing the entire table. <code>  <tr><td>1<td><td>20<td>5%</td></td></td></td></tr>",How can I get the first and third td from a table with BeautifulSoup?

drop down menu/ text field in one," I'm working on building new site, and I need a drop down menu to select the amount of something in my site.

angularjs cascading select/dropdowns," I'm attempting to create a chained/cascading drop-down (select elements) using AngularJS but I'm having difficulty filtering and updating the 'selected' properties with my object properties.When the page first loads, the selected items are filtered and displaying in the drop-downs properly. Once I change the parent drop-down, the child selected item doesn't grab the first item in the filtered list, causing the grandchild drop-down to not update.Any insight would be greatly appreciated and note that I have the parent/child/grandchild arrays separated (and not in sub-arrays) because I will eventually be pulling my data from separate spocs/tables in SQL.

Is it possible to apply some 'funny' graphical transformation to the whole HTML document?," This question has been flagged as off-topic (apparently because it is to recommend or find a tool, library or favorite off-site resource), but I fail to see why. It is certainly not about recommending a tool or anything like that. I would just like to know if something is possible to do, and if it is: how.Let's say we have some ordinary HTML page, and want to apply some graphical effect to it, just for a while, then return to the previous form as if nothing has happened.An effect I have in mind is something like that:Are there any jQuery plugins (because it seems there is a jQuery plugin for everything) that can do that? Is it even doable, with HTML5 or CSS3 (I don't care much about legacy browsers support)?The only thing I could come up with was to replace the page with some image, and then apply the transformation to that image, but that doesn't seem like a very good solution, because it would not be possible for the image to look exactly like what a user sees (since the page content is usually dynamic).Okay, so CSS3 has this transform thing, but for what I can see it provides only relatively simple transformations. What about my case of twisting and squeezing? <code> ",Is it possible to apply a twist & squeeze transformation to a whole HTML document?

"jQuery Scrolling, Anchor Cycler/Dropdown List, Table Autosizing, JSON Updating (Large post)"," SO, I've been working on some html/javascript/css recently to create an online table for my students to view details, scores and various bits of information but I've hit a brick wall and am unsure how to do what I'm trying to do.The reason I'm posting all of these in one thread is because several of these I think could conflict and cause the previous edit(s) to fail to function...I realise that there are a lot of questions in one here and don't expect someone to code the entire thing, I'm just looking for some help / snippits / ideas and would greatly appreciate especially those with comments/descriptions so that I can continue to learn and improve :)Update 13/11/2013 @ 02:43 GMTLATEST: http://jsfiddle.net/pwv7u/I'm trying to get Next Class | Previous Class to be cycle buttons to move to and from classes the same way the dropdown works.The scroll bar what used to be at the bottom of the page has disappeared because of the width has been changed...The footer at the bottom doesn't show correctly on mobile devices and the Scroll Left and Scroll buttons don't appear at all on mobile devices.The scroll left button is unable to be clickedRefreshing the page resets the horizontal scroll position to far left (I'm pretty sure this relates to the scroll bar)In regards to the loading/refreshing I guess I'll have to make another post as the current options are nearly there but not quite, I'll example below the way(s) that I ideally want it to work.main.html will not contain any class details it would be: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=HwXM67upThe ""option"" (dropdown) would somehow poll a json file to gather a list of classes avaliableThe ""option"" (dropdown) will have options for each individual school class aswell as ""All Updating"" and ""All Non-Updating""Selecting an individual school class will import ONLY that specific school class into the page.Selecting a different individual school class will destory the old school class and import the newly selected school class.Individual school classes will periodically poll the json file to check for updates / changes to that school classes data and on a change/update it will re-draw/re-import.Selecting ""All Updating"" will import ALL school classes and periodically poll the json file to check for updates / changes to any school class (if possible only updating the school class what has changed/updated) but with all classes visible on the page.Selecting ""All Non-Updating"" will do the same as above but won't need to poll the json file to update.I can split the data into blocks like: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=MRpjvJp0 (first block example) fairly easily and give them correct titles (titles that would be used in the Option dropdown), unsure how to put them into json format though <code> ",Anchor Cycler / Dropdown to import school class data periodically

How to define decimal and integer input fields?," I'm looking for an accessible way to define whether a field is meant to accept integer or decimal amounts. The input fields come in two varieties: a simple <input> which is meant for decimal values (dollars and cents), and an <input> with a trailing "".00"" that indicates a whole number is required (dollars only).Example:Since the "".00"" is not in the <label> it won't be read by the screen reader. I've had to use an ugly hack to make it accessible: (Even though the span is hidden JAWS will read it when the input has focus.)What is a more accessible and semantic way to inform assistive technologies which number format is being requested?Some notes:In my case it's not acceptable to allow the user to enter ""123.45"" and then round it to ""123"" on the server if I need a whole number. There is no client-side validation, so if they user enters the wrong type of value the page will come back with a descriptive error message on the field. The inputs cannot be type=""number"" due to the controls inserted by the browser. <code>  <label>Total amount due ($): <span style=""display:none;"">Please enter dollars and cents</span></label><label>Amount owed ($): <span style=""display:none;"">Please enter a dollar amount</span></label>",How to clearly label the formats for numeric input for screen readers?

AngularJS directive / When directive's name really matters," I've just come across a strange behavior from Angular:Here's the scenario:In a registration form, I want to check for email uniqueness (through an http call to server).Thus, I created a directive called emailUnique whose client code is: For the rest of the post, let's suppose that user is typing: michael, that is clearly not a valid mail.Let's take a look at the interesting portion of my directive code, triggering the behavior I'm interested to: Before giving the answer, at first glance, the response would logically be: Why? Because:We precise the type=""email"" attribute and not simply type=""text""michael isn't a valid mail.Angular's compiler is supposed to conform to classic HTML behavior.After testing it, the answer is undefined as expected. My complete directive's logic will be based on that and the whole works fine.Now, let's rename the directive: emailUnique becoming somethingUnique.Client being now: Surprise: the console.log(viewValue) is now displaying: michael, not undefined ...Clearly, starting with email for the name has a strange effect when dealing with an email field in this case. My question is simple: Is there a good reason? A possible bug? Might I misunderstand some notion?Some further precisions: The Angular's documentation about Email field with angular does not present some email attribute that could interfere with email-unique. Indeed, it's based on the type=""email""I came across the same issue whether the form's novalidate attribute is present or not. <code>  <form name=""form"" novalidate><!-- some other fields --><input name=""email"" type=""email"" ng-model=""user.email"" required email-unique/></form> angular.module('directives.emailUnique', []) .directive('emailUnique', function () { return { restrict: 'A', require: 'ngModel', link: function (scope, el, attrs, ctrl) { ctrl.$parsers.push(function (viewValue) { console.log(viewValue); //What do you expect here for viewValue? answer below }); } }; }); undefined <input name=""email"" type=""email"" ng-model=""user.email"" required something-unique/>",When Angular directive's name really matters

Basically, the idea is to cut out any extra overhead when the page loads in the browser.So there are 2 ways I can go about doing this:I can either...a.) remove any extra parts from the library, create a new build, and then load that into our project.For example: Or... b.) modularize the entire Bootstrap3, separate each component into its own file, and write the entire build into the html, while commenting out the things we don't need.For example: etc...The advantage of using the second option would be that it would give the other developers more control of the bootstrap components that we're loading into the project, without having to go and rebuild it again. If in any event in the future they need to load some new Bootstrap components, they can just uncomment that line of code. That would make this more flexible for other developers to use, and it wouldn't restrain them from developing further throughout the project using Bootstrap.What are some thoughts about this however? Would pulling more files into the project (as opposed to pulling in one large file) increase the overhead at loading time? Is this against ""good/best practice""? <code>  <!-- Custom build of a slimmed down Bootstrap --><script src=""/bootstrap/3.0.3/js/bootstrap.min.js""></script> <!-- All Bootstrap components--><script src=""/bootstrap/3.0.3/js/glyphicons_bootstrap.min.js""></script><script src=""/bootstrap/3.0.3/js/buttongroups.min.js""></script><script src=""/bootstrap/3.0.3/js/inputgroups_bootstrap.min.js""></script><!-- <script src=""/bootstrap/3.0.3/js/navs_bootstrap.min.js""></script> DON'T NEED THIS --><script src=""/bootstrap/3.0.3/js/navbars_bootstrap.min.js""></script><!-- <script src=""/bootstrap/3.0.3/js/breadcrumbs_bootstrap.min.js""></script> DON'T NEED THIS --><script src=""/bootstrap/3.0.3/js/pagination_bootstrap.min.js""></script>",Separately loading in Bootstrap components

Zooming out a div using CSS," I have a DIV that is covering the whole page (height and width are 100%). I am trying to use CSS (and possibly JavaScript) to create a zoom out animation effect so the DIV is smaller (making everything inside the div - its children - smaller as well) to a specific point on the page (middle of the page) and to a specific width and height (let's say 100 * 100px for example).I am starting with the following code: The issue with this code is that it zooms out on component down (the parent div) and immediately zooms out what's inside it then goes back to zoom in the components. Basically it is a little buggy. Any helpful fixes to make it zoom out everything together? It would be great if I can zoom out everything together to a specific location on the page and to a specific width/height (for example, zoom everything out to left: 100px, top: 100px and the parent div should be: 100px * 100px and everything else is relative in size).I understand this might be easier with JavaScript? Any help?One final note, if you notice the animation is not really reflecting a zoom animation. Although this would be an additional plus, the actual zoom animation would be great.JSFiddle link to make it easier: http://jsfiddle.net/HU46s/ <code>  <div id=""toBeZoomedOut""> <div>something</div> <div><img src=""background.jpg""></div></div>#toBeZoomedOut { background-color: black; border: 1px solid #AAAAAA; color: white; width: 300px; height: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; -webkit-transition: 1s ease-in-out; -moz-transition: 1s ease-in-out; transition: 1s ease-in-out;}#toBeZoomedOut img { height: 250px; width: 250px;}#toBeZoomedOut:hover { zoom: 0.5;}",How to zoom out a div using animations?

Whatever happened to the archive attribute?," Back in the day (yes I really am this old) you could reference scripts out of a renamed zip file like this This was supported on IE4, NS4 and Opera5 with identical mark-up and semantics, but has been consigned to the digital scrapyard. Why?OK for those of you interested in the answer but not interested enough to trawl through an old message thread (see comments below) the long and the short of it is that you get the compression from the transport layer merely by specifying Content-Encoding: gzip so it is inappropriate to support mark-up in the presentation layer and therefore it was removed. This also improves granularity because script files are individually versioned in the cache.Given the transport layer use of gzip, what is the point of minification? The gzip dictionary tokenising pass will achieve this over the wire without producing a horrible debugger experience.I agree that concatenation will improve the compression yield. I suppose some server/browser combinations might fail to use gzip, in which case minification would help. <code>  <script archive=""path/to.jar"" src=""some.js""></script>",Why minify when the transport will gzip?

Most cross-browser safe way to build dynamic and resuable graphical element in pure CSS or CSS/SVG," 1. The GoalI am working on a highly dynamic, extensible block/inline-block level element-style. It'll look like this:2. What I Actually NeedAdvice on choosing from amongst my options, basically. What approach is most compatible with cross-browser friendliness & extensibility as primary concerns? I'm using SASS to render my CSS, so the <style> element in my example(s) is pseudocode. I want to be able to dynamically control the following with a well-defined class heirarchy:text content (idiosyncratic)height (highly variable)width (5 possible widths; I'm developing in Zurb's Foundation 5, the element will always be between 1 and 5 columns)background color (only 2-5 options here)color (only 3 options here)direction (L & R are probably adequate)3. Things I've triedBitmap This is no good; I'd have to make too many and can't control the angle of the point as it is stretched across heights.Pure CSS This is what I expect I'll have to do. SVGSo I'll just confess that I only loosely understand how to harness what I know is the very powerful potential of SVG, here. I've generated this SVG in Illustrator, though I think that probably it needs to be modified in order to be as extensible as I'd like: But don't reeeeeally understand how to use it; I gather, for example, that I cannot achieve my ends if I use it as the background-image property argument of an element that otherwise contains the text; but neither do I get how this is done on the fly via CSS. UPDATEA comment requested the compiled CSS, here it is; I haven't checked the colors, I expect they are nonsensical at the moment, but otherwise I think this covers it: <code>  <!-- the HTML --><div class=""arrow-label""> <h4 class=""expand""><?php echo $label-text;?></h4> <a href=""#"" class=""triangle right-facing""></a></div><style> div.arrow-label { h4 { display:inline-block; background-color: $arrow-label-background-color; } .triangle { background-color: $arrow-label-background-color; } }.triangle { width:0; height:0; display:inline-block; margin:0; border-style: solid; transition: border-color 300ms ease-out; // I have removed transitional selectors (ie. :hover) below for brevity's sake &.up-facing { border-width: 0 rem-calc(12px) rem-calc(15px) rem-calc(12px); border-color: transparent transparent $triangle-color transparent; } // rinse/repeat for .left-facing, .right-facing, .bottom-facing &.disabled { transition:none; color: $triangle-disabled-color; } &.inherited-transition { transition: inherit} }</style> <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?><!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""><svg version=""1.1"" id=""Layer_1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" x=""0px"" y=""0px"" width=""635.436px"" height=""156.041px"" viewBox=""0 0 635.436 156.041"" enable-background=""new 0 0 635.436 156.041"" xml:space=""preserve""><polygon fill=""#333333"" points=""576.576,155.254 635.436,78.02 576.576,0.787 576.576,0 575.976,0 575.976,0 575.976,0 0,0 0,156.041 576.576,156.041 ""/></svg> /* The element itself */div.arrow-label h4 { display: inline-block; background-color: #323232;}/* the code I use to make triangles, and in this case, would be capping the element with note that, as per the standard, 1rem = 16px here */.triangle { width: 0; height: 0; display: inline-block; margin: 0; border-style: solid; transition: border-color 300ms ease-out;}.triangle.up-facing { border-width: 0 0.75rem 0.9375rem 0.75rem; border-color: transparent transparent #ff5555 transparent;}.triangle.up-facing:hover { border-color: transparent transparent #ffa1a1 transparent;}.triangle.up-facing:active { border-color: transparent transparent #683939 transparent;}.triangle.down-facing { border-width: 0.9375rem 0.75rem 0 0.75rem; border-color: #ff5555 transparent transparent transparent;}.triangle.down-facing:hover { border-color: #ffa1a1 transparent transparent transparent;}.triangle.down-facing:active { border-color: #bb0000 transparent transparent transparent;}.triangle.right-facing { border-width: 0.75rem 0 0.75rem 0.9375rem; border-color: transparent transparent transparent #ff5555;}.triangle.right-facing:hover { border-color: transparent transparent transparent #ffa1a1;}.triangle.right-facing:active { border-color: transparent transparent transparent #683939;}.triangle.left-facing { border-width: 0.75rem 0.9375rem 0.75rem 0; border-color: transparent #ff5555 transparent transparent;}.triangle.left-facing:hover { border-color: transparent #ffa1a1 transparent transparent;}.triangle.left-facing:active { border-color: transparent #683939 transparent transparent;}.triangle.disabled { transition: none; color: #ffa1a1;}.triangle.inherited-transition { transition: inherit;}","Most cross-browser safe way to build dynamic and resuable graphical element in pure CSS, CSS/SVG or CSS/HTML5"

Typing inside and input type text is extremely slow on iPad mini with iOS8 Mobile Safari," In mobile Safari (iOS 8.0 iPad Mini) it seems that, the more inputs (I've tried with different types) a web has, the slower the ""typing"" gets (I've even managed to freeze safari just typing). Just to make sure it was not the keyboard, I tested with Swiftkey, but the same problem arose. With Swiftkey, the input was fast, but the text was slowly inserted inside an input type text.I've created a jsFiddle with some inputs and it really goes slow (as hell). At this fiddle, I added some select with lots of ""option"" tags because I found out that this makes the situation even worse. I also tried adding autocomplete attribute (set to false) but it doesn't seem to affect in any way.This is more or less how would a ""problematic"" code look like: And now the weird thing: this doesn't happen on an iPhone 5S (didn't test it on any other iPad).Does anybody know why this happens? Or if it happens on any other device?Thanks in advance. <code>  <input class="""" type=""text"" autocorrect=""off"" /><input class="""" type=""text"" autocorrect=""off"" /><input class="""" type=""text"" autocorrect=""off"" /><input class="""" type=""text"" autocorrect=""off"" /><input class="""" type=""text"" autocorrect=""off"" /><input class="""" type=""text"" autocorrect=""off"" /><input class="""" type=""text"" autocorrect=""off"" /><input class="""" type=""text"" autocorrect=""off"" /><input class="""" type=""text"" autocorrect=""off"" /><input class="""" type=""email"" autocorrect=""off"" /><select><!-- lots of ""option"" tags --></select>",Typing inside a text input is extremely slow on iPad mini with iOS8 Mobile Safari and Safari 8

why is google chrome cancelling my request?," I have a problem in loading a webpage that has a html5 video element in it that runs into a weird problem in chrome. I say it is weird because the behavior is inconsistent.here is a screenshot to explain my problem...this is the side by side comparison of the same page when opened in firefox and chrome. The firefox loads the page as it should but chrome does not load the video when play is clicked. Even IE 11 had no issues in loading the video.Now let me specify the environment where the problem occurs as well. The whole application is hosted on IHS/ Websphere (test environment-although WAS does all the job- not under my control). The link is,http://wwwtest.courts.mo.gov/civiceducation/pages/const_proj_home.htmlI do have another environment where the site is hosted by tomcat where there is no problem at all no matter what browser is used. The link to that page (the exact page under review) is,http://www.courts.mo.gov/civiceducation/pages/const_proj_home.htmlI would appreciate if someone would help me in understanding what is causing this issue or why. Thanks in advanceUPDATE::: durin my research i found this SO post What does status=canceled for a resource mean in Chrome Developer Tools? and found this link which says that it is a chrome bug issue dated april 2013 http://wwwtest.courts.mo.gov/civiceducation/pages/const_proj_home.html but then why does chrome load the videos when a different webserver(tomcat) is used?UPDATE #2 ::::i was able to isolate the problem just to mp4 files.In my section of code that handled the video, I flipped the source tags that pointed to mp4 and webm such that the webm is now listed first... Now the page load works just fine. Even though this solved my original problem, I would still like to know what is causing this issue.UPDATE #3::: Disregard update#2I thought that the problem was solved but over the weekend I did not test it and now even webm files are not working. Its cancelling the request again. Only when I have websphere as my app server. Hence in am adding the tag ""Websphere"" back into the mix. Here is a screenshot now...And here is the comparison screenshot between tomcat server and WAS 8.5 side by side on chromeI am running out of ideas as my requirement going forward is that the content is going to be hosted on the Websphere server.

nicely formated tables in Markdown: kniter not compiling stargazer>html table," I'm trying to embed an output table, nicely formatted by the stargazer function, in a markdown document.

Chrome Extension: Is there a flexible way to modify the contents of an editable element?," Subject:I am creating a Google Chrome extension that interacts with web pages via a content script and an event page. I have context menu options that appear if a user clicks on an element that is categorized as editable by the chrome.contextMenus API. The options act like shortcuts for commonly entered text. When the user clicks an option, some text is placed inside the element at the position of the cursor. If the user has text highlighted, it is deleted. Problem:Not all editable elements can be modified the same way. If the element is a simple textarea the desired result can be achieved by implementing this solution:Replacing selected text in the textareaHowever, I can not assume that I am interacting with a normal textarea. Possible nuances include:The text area being hidden inside an Iframe, which complicates the process of finding the element to interact with (document.activeElement may return the Iframe, rather than the element that actually contains the text).The <textarea> not being a <textarea>/<input> at all, but rather a contentEditable <div>. The .value approach will not work in this case.So I am searching for a flexible way to do this that can handle all edge cases elegantly. Some solutions I have tried:option 1 :I originally planned on storing the value in the system clipboard. Then, I could conceivably just use document.execCommand('paste') to modify the element. However, after trying it, this approach seems to have the same drawbacks as my initial approach. (See this question) Additionally, this approach would delete whatever was in the clipboard before the operation. This is undesirable and any solution that utilizes this approach must provide a work around. option 2 : Another option that I have considered is dispatching keyboard events for each character in the string. However, with this solution, you still run into the Iframe problem and it doesn't allow you do use special Unicode characters.

what is the current state of the style element in HTML5," It states here http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/style.html#style: Permitted parent elements any element that can contain metadata elements, div, noscript, section, article, asidethat <style> is more or less allowed every where (where <div> is allowed)but, on the other hand, I found a more detailed information here http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html5-20121025/the-style-element.html#attr-style-scoped Contexts in which this element can be used: (annotation: style) and later in this document: The scoped attribute is a boolean attribute. If present, it indicates that the styles are intended just for the subtree rooted at the style element's parent element, as opposed to the whole Document. If the scoped attribute is present and the element has a parent element, then the style element must be the first node of flow content in its parent element other than inter-element whitespace, and the parent element's content model must not have a transparent component.This reads like there are (or will be) ""two different <style> elements"": a <style> - global - ~~only within <head> <""scopestyle""> - only(!) with bool scope attr and ~~only at start of <div>(pls. read ""~~"" like ""more or less"")But the later link is more than 2 years old, and all Browsers (I tested Chrome, FF, IE, Opera) interpret the inflow <style> as if it was in header. (and ignore AFAIK the scope - yes - still no standard) So my 3-part questionIs my interpretation of the W3C documents (the 2 styles - logic) correct?What is the state now - 2015?And, is there probably someone out there, who knows whats on the horizon coming?  <code>  If the scoped attribute is absent: where metadata content is expected.If the scoped attribute is absent: in a noscript element that is a child of a head element.If the scoped attribute is present: where flow content is expected, but before any other flow content other than inter-element whitespace, and not as the child of an element whose content model is transparent.","What is the current state of the ""scoped"" attribute for the style element in HTML5?"

Does Angular use DOM diffing?," I'm new to Angular, but I've already heard (and read) some ""rumors"" about its rendering model and how it is different from for example React.I've read some posts of Angular experts who claim that if you have to render long lists with Angular, it could be slow because Angular would re-render the whole list if something changes, while React (for example) ""won't re-render the whole list from scratch once it has already been rendered but it will keep track of rendered DOM elements internally and upon new invocation create new virtual DOM, compare it to the previous one and only apply the changes"" (quoted from a random blog post about Angular rendering issues)So as I started learning Angular, my first thing was trying this out.And it seems that I cannot reproduce the problem...Here is a dummy Plunker which I created to reproduce the issue.You can add new items to a list of messages which is rendered with ng-repeat like this: You can click on a button which could update one such item, and you can update another property which is totally unrelated to the list (name)Now if I open developer toolbar, and modify an item's HTML attributes inside the table and then I click on ""add a new message"", my modifications don't get lost or overwritten by Angular - it seems that Angular doesn't re-render the DOM fully. It seems to be pretty smart.Has Angular started to use DOM diffing lately?

How to calculate a CRC32 of an arrayBuffer (javascript) compatible with php," On the client side (Javascript) I'm using the FileReader() Object to read a local file from a browser and this file is sent to the server (PHP) thanks to the XMLHttpRequest() object. The object I recover thanks to the FileReader object is an arrayBuffer. This ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer and its content can not be manipulate directly.To optimize the transfer I split the file in several chunk. I want to check the integrity of each chunk transferred (Each chunk is about 100KB). The idea is to calculate the CRC on the javascript side and the server side, then compare the two CRC to check the integrity and retry the transfer if needed.JAVASCRIPT PHP <code>  var fileReader = new FileReader();fileReader.onload = function(event){ var arrayBuffer = event.target.result; // // TODO : calculate the crc of this arrayBuffer var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); ... xhr.open(YourMethod,YourUrl,true); ... xhr.addEventListener('loadend', function (event) { var CRCFromPhp = event.target.responseText; // TODO : compare the CRC from php with the CRC from javascript }}fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob); $file_crc = hash_file(""crc32b"",$target_file,FALSE); $file_crc = sprintf('%u',hexdec($file_crc)); echo $file_crc; ",How to calculate the CRC of an arrayBuffer (From FileReader in javascript) compatible with the CRC32 function in php?

CSS is not applied when refreshing on another view," I'm currently working on my first Ionic App and working with Angular for the first time.I am using the pie-chart library to display charts on the dashboard of the app. This works nicely if I refresh while I am on the dashboard and looks like this:https://imgur.com/YUCAO6i,oakGp8c#1But if I navigate to another tab, lets say the server tab, and refresh there, the width and height is not applied to the charts on the dashboard. Instead they are rendered using the standard width and height (500h x 900w instead of 100h x 100w). (See second picture on imgur). If I refresh on the dashboard again, they will render normally.I went through the source code of the library and saw that when refreshing on the dashboard, the element[0].parentElement.offsetWidth equals 100, but if I refresh when on another view, it is 0, so the default values are used. It looks like the pie-chart directive can't access the parent when on another view.Here is the HTML and CSS used:HTML CSS I tried to find an answer for hours, but I am not even sure what exactly I need to search for.

"Why is the `keyup` handler being invoked here, and can I prevent it?"," Consider the following HTML5+Javascript: Originally, all this did was to capture click events on the text hello, replacing the text with an input box. When the user then hit Enter, the new text would be saved to server via AJAX and the input box again replaced with just the text.Now I've added the a tag to allow navigation via Tab+Enter rather than only using the mouse (accessibility; yay!), but I'm finding that, when doing so, the call to focus() magically triggers the keyup() event. (I know this because commenting out the call to focus() otherwise results in the desired behaviour.)The result is that tabbing and entering onto the text opens but then immediately closes the input box, and as far as the user's concerned, nothing has happened at all.Why is the input's keyup handler being triggered by a click event on a completely unrelated element?

Paragraph overflow," So I have a cell with a fixed height with title and content(shown below).When the screen size gets smaller, the title gets text-overflow:ellipsis;.Here is the markup that I used for both title and content: However with the content part (simple div), the content extends beyond the container (not shown in the picture). Also because content usually has a paragraph, when i apply the same css markup as above, it goes simply beyond the container in a long line without break.What I am trying to achieve is the last part (red circle) in the image.So, I already have outer cell max-heightset. How can I make it so that the content stays within the cell max-height and whatever overflows goes to a next line and text-overflow: ellipsis; is applied instead of a long straight line?Thanks guys. <code>  overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; ",Paragraph overflow with ellipsis

What am I doing wrong?Is there any other similar solution that can merge SVGs into one file and use them as responsive images?Thanks! <code>  <svg style=""display:none;""><defs><symbol id=""mys""> <path fill-rule=""evenodd"" clip-rule=""evenodd"" fill=""#3F77BC"" d=""M222.1,77.7h-10.3c0.1-0.8,0.2-1.4,0.2-2.3 c0-8.5-6.9-15.4-15.4-15.4c-8.5,0-15.4,6.9-15.4,15.4c0,0.9,0.1,1.5,0.2,2.3h-9.3v4h-24.9v-5.2H89.4c0-0.3,0-0.6,0-0.9 C89.4,67.1,82.5,60,74,60s-15.4,6.9-15.4,15.4c0,0.3,0,0.6,0,0.9h-6.2V60.7h4.3l5.3-5.3h22.8L74.3,44.9l-13.5-3.6l0.5-1.7 l-16.5-4.4c-0.3,0.1-0.7,0.2-1,0.2l0,21.4h2v7.2c0,0-2,0.6-1.9,1.3c0.1,0.7,4.1,2.6,3.4,5.5c-0.6,2.9-1.6,4.8-4.4,4.5 c-2.7-0.3-3.4-1.4-3.4-2.6c-0.1-1.2,0-3,0-3L38,67.9c0,0,2-0.5,2.6,1.1c0.6,1.5-0.2,2.7,0.6,3.5c0.8,0.8,4.1,1.4,4.1-1.1 c0-2.5-0.5-2.4-2.1-3.6c-1.7-1.2-3.4-2.8-3.4-3.3c0-0.5-0.1-7.7-0.1-7.7h2.1l0-21.7c-1.4-0.7-2.5-2.1-2.5-3.8 c0-2.3,1.9-4.2,4.2-4.2c2,0,3.6,1.4,4.1,3.2l15.3,4.1l0.4-1.6l55.8,15.1h28.1c0,0,0-23.5,0-26.2c0-2.7,2.1-2.6,2.1-2.6 s32.5-0.5,35.1,0.5c2.7,1,3.3,3.7,3.3,3.7h-2l5,11.6c0,0,7.3,4.6,17.6,7.6c10.3,3,13.6,7.6,13.6,7.6l-1,17.6l1.3,2V77.7z M81.5,46.8l8.6,8.6h9.3l2.9-2.9L81.5,46.8z M175.5,25l-17.4-0.1v12.6h9.6l2.7,2.7h6.6L175.5,25z M183,23.7h-4c0,0,2,6.6,3,9.9 s0.9,4.2,2.7,4.2c1.9,0,4.2,0,4.2,0L183,23.7z M74.2,63.8c6.8,0,12.3,5.5,12.3,12.3S81,88.4,74.2,88.4c-6.8,0-12.3-5.5-12.3-12.3 S67.4,63.8,74.2,63.8z M196.6,63.8c6.8,0,12.3,5.5,12.3,12.3s-5.5,12.3-12.3,12.3s-12.3-5.5-12.3-12.3S189.8,63.8,196.6,63.8z""/></symbol></defs></svg><div style=""position:relative;width:100%;background:blue;""> <svg class=""mys"" viewBox=""0 0 254 108"" preserveAspectRatio=""xMaxYMax meet"" style=""width:100%;""> <use xlink:href=""#mys""></use> <svg></div>",SVGs not scaling properly in IE - has extra space
Javascript - Cloning audio source without having to download it again," I'm creating a piano in the browser using javascript. In order for me to play the same key multiple times simultaneously, instead of just playing the Audio object, I clone it and play the clone, otherwise I'd have to wait for the audio to finish or to restart it, which I don't want.I've done something like this: The problem is, I was checking chrome's inspector, and I noticed that every time I clone the object, the browser download it againI checked some people who wanted to achieve similar things, and noticed that most of them have the same problem that I do, they redownload the file. The only example I found that can play the same audio source multiple times simultaneously is SoundJs http://www.createjs.com/SoundJSI tried checking the source could but couldn't figure out how it was done.

Jquery - copy HTML table structure to clipboard, Im just looking for advice on this. Ive been looking trough the internet for possible solutions on how to copy an HTML table structure with it's text to clipboard but no so lucky so far.What I have at the moment is a simple table with data and users would need to copy that into an email using Outlook and when you copy/paste it. Pasting this manually into Outlook would show the table structure and its text rendered correctly. The only issue is that sometimes users could have several large tables making it sometimes clumsy to copy and scroll down at the same time to reach the bottom of the page.So I am looking to get a simple button that essentially will do that automatically. So I am looking for something that would find my main div container and copy all of the table structures and text within it to the user's clipboard. I found that the most popular solution is called ZeroClipboard however it only copies the text and not the actual HTML table structure with it. Would anyone know if this is something that is possible to accomplish with Jquery or other addons? I would appreciate any advice on this. <code> ,Copy HTML table structure to clipboard

Manually fire an IDBOpenDBRequest.onupgradeneeded event?," I am writing a Chrome extension that utilizes IndexedDB to store some information client side in an IDBObjectStore within an IDBDatabase.The nature of the data is such that I need my users to be able to modify the object store at their whim. (add new objects modify existing ones etc.) I am accomplishing this through a settings page and all is fine and dandy so far.The caveat comes when I want to release a new version of the (default) object store. If I didn't care about overwriting my users' data, then I could just handle the onupgradeneeded event the same way I handle it when it is fired in reaction to a fresh install. Which would be something like: ...but I do care.So, what I am currently doing is placing a conditional inside of the upgrade(event) function that checks for the truthyness of event.oldVersion (its 0 on a fresh install). If the value is greater than 0, then I open a new tab that contains an options page where the user can pick and choose which objects he wants to update.Now the tricky part: Once this page closes I need to send a message to the background page that contains the necessary upgrade information. Normally, I would just receive the message in my listener and perform the update, utilizing the provided information. However, IDBDatabase.createObjectStore() throws an InvalidStateError if:The method [is] not called from a versionchange transaction callback.When I look at the spec for IDBDatabase.transaction(storenames, mode), in the mode parameter description, it says:versionchange mode can't be specified here.So, it seems to me like I need to trigger an onupgradeneeded event, but I also need to pass the event handler an additional parameter, besides the event itself, which contains information that it can use to decide how to perform the upgrade.I don't know how to go about doing this though.Can anyone offer me some insight? <code>  var request = window.indexedDB.open(DB_NAME, CURRENT_DB_VERSION);request.onupgradeneeded = upgrade;function upgrade(event){ var db = event.target.result; var objectStore = db.createObjectStore(""domains"", {keyPath: ""id"", autoIncrement: true}); objectStore.createIndex(""domain"", ""domain"", {multiEntry: true }); for(var i=0; i<tags.length; i++){ objectStore.add(tags[i]); console.log(""added "" + tags[i][""domain""] + "" to the IDBObjectStore 'domains' in the IDBDatabase 'Tags' (Format)""); }}",IndexedDB: Can you manually initiate a version change transaction?

Is an input field valid while is emtpy?," I've been experimenting with css pseudo classes and pseudo elements and I discover something that I have not been able to get around.Consider the following html input field: In order to achieve 3 states: empty, valid and invalid. I'm using the ::after pseudo element (applied to the span adjacent to the input) to add a checkmark when the value of the filed is valid, and an X when the value is invalid. I'm using the pseudo classes :valid and :invalid and it seems that when an input field is empty (value="""") its state is also valid. The CSS in question is as follows: For what I'm able to tell, after clearing the value in the browser, the second css rules takes precedence, even though the specificity is the same.I tested the selectors here: specificity calculator and it seems that attributes and pseudo classes have the same weight.  <code>  <input type=""number"" value=""1"" min=""1"" max=""1000"" step=""1"" pattern=""\d"" /><span></span> .v3_forms input[value=""""] + span::after { content: """";}.v3_forms input:valid + span::after { content: ""\2713""; color: limegreen;}.v3_forms input:invalid + span::after { content: ""X""; color: #ce0000;}",Is an input field valid while is empty?

HTML/CSS Obscurity Compiling," I have a question about obfuscate the final output of an HTML and CSS file.Lets stay I have this HTML code below with the corresponding class names declared in a separate CSSfile: Is there a way to take my HTML/CSS file and process it in a way that it will take original class names/ids in a HTML/CSS file and randomly generate new files to replace the existing class names/ids with meaningless class names/ids to obscure the final output? For example, The above output would be processed and result in the html shown below with a corresponding style sheet that has the abstracted class/id names defined. <code>  <div class=""header""> <div class=""logo""></div> <div class=""session-info""></div></div> <div class=""bank-account-content""> <div class=""account-info""></div> <div class=""account-info""></div> <div class=""here-is-my-ss-number""></div></div> <div class=""1dcx4y""> <div class=""1354fs""></div> <div class=""f3wecd""></div></div> <div class=""retv5""> <div class=""dgee2f></div> <div class=""fhg54h""></div> <div class=""dgd426""></div></div> ",HTML/CSS Obfuscation Compiling
Keeping flexbox centered when text wraps to 2 or more lines," I am trying to center two div elements side by side in a row with flexbox (display:flex).The first div element, on the left, just has an image.The second div element, on the right, has left-aligned inline text of unspecified length.When the line of text is short enough to fit on one line, both divs are aligned and justified to the center as I expect.When the line of text is long enough to wrap onto two lines, the second div element does not wrap itself around the content as I expect. Instead, it leaves a large white space on the right side of the div.I mocked up an example here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NGqYQX?editors=110.

Jekyll CSS styling," I have been playing around with Jekyll for a couple of weeks now and I am trying to create a default style for each of my blog posts, but I'm not exactly sure where and how it's supposed to be done. My main index page works fine in terms of styling but my posts have no CSS being passed to them whatsoever despite trying various methods. Is the CSS for blog posts supposed to be written in _layouts/default.html or _layouts/posts.html, and do I have to specify which stylesheets I want to use in the YAML, by using {% include ...%}, or by writing I wasn't able to find information that gave a clear cut answer. <code>  {% if page.style %} <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""{{ page.style }}"">{% endif %}",Including CSS stylesheets in Jekyll pages

How to prevent controls from stealing focus," The default behavior on Mac OS X is that clicking checkboxes and buttons doesn't steal focus from other controls that have focus (for example, a textbox).

Weird behaviour in Internet Explorere when changing src attribute on image," I have a problem with some javascript in Internet Explorer.It works fine in other browsers.I have the following method, that changes the src property of an images and when this happens a download of that image should start. See below: The problem is that in when changing this property Internet Explorer starts an endless loop of downloading images. Notice that i have put a console.log in the for-loop. I can confirm that this for-loop does not run in an endles loop. It is only run once for each image that should be downloaded. So that is not the problem.The behaviour can actually be seen on this page: http://www.energy-frames.dk/Konfigurator. Hit F12 and check in the network tab. Make a change to image on the homepage so a download of new images is started, e.g. Bredde(Width in english), see below:When this change is made new images are downloaded in an endless loop(it happens almost every time in IE). See below of what you could changeI have really spent a lot of time debugging in this and i cant see why it behaves like this in IE but not in all other browsers.So does anyone have any idea why this happens? Or have some suggestions on what i could try?EDIT:@gxoptgI have tried what you suggested. using ""javascript:void 0"" like this: and this: gives me this error:On the other hand, if i completely remove the line img.attr(""src"", """");in the imgLoadError method, then i see that images are not downloaded in an endless loop. On the other hand they are not displayed. So am i using the javascript:void 0 wrong?When i do the following: Then the there is not endless loop but the image wont appear in IE - still works fine in chrome. <code>  for (var i = 0; i < imagesStartedDownloading.length; i++) { if (imagesStartedDownloading[i] == false && responseItems[i] == true) { console.log(""image"", i); var url = baseurl + ""/ImageDownload/?imageName="" + hash + ""_"" + imageDegrees[i] + "".jpg"" + ""&r="" + Math.random(); imagesStartedDownloading[i] = true; images.eq(i).attr(""src"", url); }} var newimg = $(""<img class='rotator"" + (isMainImage ?

List inside nested flexbox layout will not grow," I am working on a nested flexbox layout which should work as follows:The outermost level (ul#main) is a horizontal list that must expand to the right when more items are added to it. If it grows too big, there should be a horizontal scroll bar. Each item of this list (ul#main>li) has a header (ul#main>li>h2) and an inner list (ul#main>li >ul.tasks). This inner list is vertical and should wrap into columns when needed. When wrapping into more columns, its width should increase to make room for more items. This width increase should apply also to the containing item of the outer list. My problem is that the inner lists don't wrap when the height of the window gets too small. I have tried lots of tampering with all the flex properties, trying to follow the guidelines at CSS-Tricks meticulously, but no luck.This JSFiddle shows what I have so far.Expected result (what I want):Actual result (what I get):Older result (what I got in 2015):UPDATEAfter some investigation, this is beginning to look like a bigger issue. All major browsers behave the same way, and it has nothing to do with my flexbox design being nested. Even simpler flexbox column layouts refuse to increase the list's width when the items wrap.This other JSFiddle clearly demonstrates the problem. In current versions of Chrome, Firefox and IE11, all items wrap correctly; the list's height increases in row mode, but its width does not increase in column mode. Also, there is no immediate reflow of elements at all when changing the height of a column mode, but there is in row mode.However, the official specs (look specifically at example 5) seem to indicate that what I want to do should be possible.Can someone come up with a workaround to this problem?UPDATE 2After a lot of experimenting using JavaScript to update the height and width of various elements during resize events, I have come to the conclusion that it is too complex and too much trouble to try to solve it that way. Also, adding JavaScript definitely breaks the flexbox model, which should be kept as clean as possible.For now, I'm falling back to overflow-y: auto instead of flex-wrap: wrap so that the inner container scrolls vertically when needed. It is not pretty, but it is one way forward that at least does not break useability too much. <code>  #main { display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: nowrap; overflow-x: auto; /* ...and more... */} .tasks { flex-direction: column; flex-wrap: wrap; /* ...and more... */}","When flexbox items wrap in column mode, container does not grow its width"

"CSS position:fixed without top has ""interesting"" behavior"," Given: And: Note that position:static, this gives the expected result (fiddle):However, change position:static to fixed, and you get this (fiddle)Even though the #fixed div is not inside #nonfixed, it has taken on the top margin of #nonfixed. This happens in both Chrome and Firefox. Curiously, the dev tools in both browsers do not show the #fixed div having any margins, so clearly it's being positioned as if it was fixed inside the #nonfixed div.If I add top:0 to the #fixed ruleset the div goes back to the top of the window, but shouldn't this appear at the top (i.e. where it would in normal flow, but without affecting other elements) in the absence of a top specification?For completeness: position:relative produces the same result as static and absolute looks the same as fixed.I cannot find anything in the spec that directly addresses why an absolutely positioned element should be positioned relative to a subsequent sibling. In fact, reading the spec I find (emphasis mine): 10.6.4 Absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements ... If all three of 'top', 'height', and 'bottom' are auto, set 'top' to the static position and apply rule number three below. ... 'height' and 'bottom' are 'auto' and 'top' is not 'auto', then the height is based on the content per 10.6.7, set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0, and solve for 'bottom' This seems to indicate the #fixed box should indeed be at the top of the viewport.Since both FF and Chrome do the same thing I'm guessing it's supposed to work this way, but I'd like to know why. Can anyone explain this behavior in terms of the spec? <code> ",CSS position:fixed without top gives unexpected layout?
"Is there a standard way to provide alt="""" text for screen-readers on HTML5 animations?"," When creating HTML5 animations, is there a technique that can be used to ""synchronize"" the alternate text so that screen-readers reads the given element that appears the moment it appears (or triggered by an event / timeline-driven)?Ideally, something that I could invoke with GSAP (using it as the animation library for my projects).Or could such a thing just make the screen-reader speak and pause repeatedly too often, ending up sounding more frustrating than actually enhancing the experience of the user? Would I be better off just to paste essentially a ""script"" of all the animation that is going on, on one line in the alt=""..."" attribute?EDIT:This question is mostly targetted for HTML5 ads - so I'm assuming there has to be a non-invasive way to screen-read the events happening in an animation without requiring the user to actually click the ad to gain focus (which would involuntarily open up the link the ad refers to). At the same time, wouldn't it be some sort of user violation to ""force focus"" on the ad's dynamic text if the user is in middle of reading an article / only interested to another area of the page? This raises so many other questions! <code> ","Is there a standard way to provide alt="""" text for screen-readers on HTML5 ads / animations?"

CSS way to keep box-shadow direction consistent by transform: rotate," When giving e.g. a <div> a box-shadow as well as rotating it will cause a rotation of the box-shadow direction - which is problematic when the box-shadow should create an illusion of lighting.Example: https://jsfiddle.net/5h7z4swk/ The answer to this problem should look similar to this mock up:How can I rotate a <div> and still keep the box-shadow going the same direction?The solution should be pure CSS...Note: The animation in the CSS is for demonstration purposes. The use case will use JavaScript to set the rotation. But the JavaScript will know nothing about the box-shadow as it is in the responsibility of the design to define a (or many...) shadows. That's why it should be a pure CSS solution. <code>  div { width: 50px; height: 50px; margin: 20px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px #000; display: inline-block;}#box1 { background-color: #b00;}#box2 { background-color: #0b0; transform: rotate(30deg);}#box3 { background-color: #00b; transform: rotate(60deg);}#box4 { background-color: #b0b; transform: rotate(90deg);}@keyframes spin { from { transform: rotate(0deg); } to { transform: rotate(360deg); }}#box6 { background-color: #0bb; animation-name: spin; animation-duration: 2s; animation-iteration-count: infinite;} <div id=""box1""></div><div id=""box2""></div><div id=""box3""></div><div id=""box4""></div><div id=""box6""></div>",Keep box-shadow direction consistent while rotating

Default context for HTML attributes in Sightly," I'm using Sightly and while investigating a bug in my application I noticed a behaviour I didn't expect.Some of the links would render with ampersands in the query string escaped twice. Example: Upon closer inspection, it turned out we had an org.apache.sling.rewriter.Transformer implementation escaping special characters in all href attributes running in AEM.Coupled with Sightly XSS protection, this resulted in double escapes.While investigating this further, I disabled the transformer and noticed a strange behaviour in Sightly itself.The attribute context and the default context in href attributes don't matchGiven the following three elements, I'd expect them to render the href value in the same way (with the query string escaped, consistent with W3C standards) However, only the last one performs the escaping and I get For some reason, the the last one, using context='attribute' (the only one that does something with the & characters) escapes the ampersands twice, yielding invalid links.This can be achieved with arbitrary element and attribute names so I think I can safely assume this is not some rewriter kicking in. Outputs: Furthermore, the Display Context Specification gave me the impression that the context, when rendering an attribute, would be picked up automatically as attributeTo protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, Sightly automatically recognises the context within which an output string is to be displayed within the final HTML output, and escapes that string appropriately.Is the observed behaviour here to be expected or am I looking at a potential bug in Sightly?Which context should I be using here? All contexts apart from attribute ignore the fact that query strings should be escaped in href. attribute on the other hand appears to be doing this twice. What's going on?I'm using Adobe Granite Sightly Template Engine (compatibility)io.sightly.bundle 1.1.72The uri context does not escape query strings in the way expected in HTML5 href attributesI did also try using But it fails to escape the & chars, resulting in invalid HTML5. Result of validation as HTML5:Error Line 70, Column 35: & did not start a character reference. (& probably should have been escaped as &.)<a href=""http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3"">explicit uri context</a>The html context correctly renders links with multiple query parameters in href attributesIt seems the only context I could possibly use here at the moment is html (text escapes & twice, just like attribute) yields Changing to this context would allow me to get the right value in the href, as rendered by the browser. However, it doesn't seem to have the correct semantics.To quote the description of the html context from the Sightly spec:Use this in case you want to output HTML - Removes markup that may contain XSS risks <code>  <a href=""http://www.google.com?a=1&amp;amp;b=2&amp;amp;c=3""> link with explicit attribute context</a> <a href=""${'http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3'}"">no explicit context, expression used</a><a href=""http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3"">no explicit context</a><a href=""${'http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3' @ context='attribute'}""> explicit attribute context</a> <a href=""http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3"">no explicit context, expression used</a><a href=""http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3"">no explicit context</a><a href=""http://www.google.com?a=1&amp;amp;b=2&amp;amp;c=3""> explicit attribute context</a> <stargate data-custom=""${'http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3' @ context='attribute'}""> attribute context in custom tag</stargate> <stargate data-custom=""http://www.google.com?a=1&amp;amp;b=2&amp;amp;c=3""> attribute context in custom tag</stargate> <a href=""${'http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3' @ context='uri'}"">explicit uri context</a> <a href=""http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3"">explicit uri context</a> <a href=""${'http://www.google.com?a=1&b=2&c=3' @ context='html'}"">explicit html context</a> <a href=""http://www.google.com?a=1&amp;b=2&amp;c=3"">explicit html context</a>",Default/correct context for HTML href attributes in Sightly

CSS / HTML fixed 5 circle rating," I'm trying to make a 5 circle rating system using CSS and HTML only (see below image for what I'd like it to look like), but I'm not sure how to achieve this.My initial idea was to make 5 circles and then somehow use them as a mask for a background colour that's the complete width of all 5 circles. So the first image has a width of 90% with a background colour of #4a494a , while the second image has a width of 60% and again, a background colour of #4a494a. These circles are fixed so no interaction shall be needed to paint them.Does anyone have any ideas on how I might do this? <code> ",Creating a fixed 5 circle rating using CSS/HTML

I would really appreciate if anyone can point out what I am doing wrong here, as the JS and CSS really seems to be perfect but the css transforms using transit is just not working as expected. <code>  $('.main-header .nav-toggle-button').on('click' , function() { // $('.main-header .navigation').toggleClass('show'); if ($('.main-header .navigation').hasClass('show')) { $('.main-header .navigation').stop().removeClass('show'); return false; } $('.main-header .navigation').stop().transition({ perspective: '1000px', rotateY: '180deg', duration : 0 }, function() { $(this).addClass('show').stop().transition({ rotateY: '0' }); }); return false;}); ","CSS-3 Transform bug, menu appearing stuck"

How to change :root color variables in JavaScript," Alright, I'm creating a system for my webpage that allows users to change the theme.

Why can't inline SVG be cached in Browsers?," SVGs have been around for years due to its scalability and it is long-familiar that the benefit of inline SVG is one can manipulate it with CSS and JS, and when we want to repeat the same SVG over a html document, then we can use the <use> tag to reference the original element. Furthermore, inline SVGs could also reduce the number of HTTP requests.However, many articles suggest (without explaining the details) that while we use inline SVG to save HTTP request, it is no longer cacheable by a browser as a separate subject, which means it is not reusable across the pages.As I happen to use inline SVGs extensively for a project, I would like to know exactly how inline SVG (the renowned html5 element, which is a w3c recommendation) can be cached in browsers whilst using SVGs with <img> tag or background-image are cacheable.If DOM is cacheable, then why can't the SVG DOM ? (which builds upon and is compatible with DOM Level 2. Ref: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/svgdom.html)So far, the solution I came up with cachebility is to use Data URI scheme (Also Ref: Optimizing svgs in data uris )But by doing so, it loses the ability to deal with CSS and JS for styling and manipulation.A few examples around the web suggest the use of JS to load cacheable resource or by replacing placeholder elements such as <object> tag, as well as using localStorage, CacheStorage and Service Worker. But I still need some guide lines to get started to achieve an ideal solution.Could someone shed me some light please?---Ref: Caching SVG Sprite in localStorageRef: Inline SVG and cachingRef: SVG ON THE WEBRef: Do Inline SVGs Weigh Down Websites? <code> ",How can we cache inline SVG in Browsers?

How to parse a HTML table with rowspans in python?," The problemI'm trying to parse an HTML table with rowspans in it, as in, I'm trying to parse my college schedule.I'm running into the problem where if the last row contains a rowspan, the next row is missing a TD where the rowspan is now that TD that is missing.I have no clue how to account for this and I hope to be able to parse this schedule.What I triedPretty much everything I can think of.The result I get As you can see, there's a vak key with the value PROJ-T in the output snippet above, dag is 4 while it's supposed to be 5 (a.k.a Friday/Vrijdag), as seen here:The result I wantA Python dict() that looks like the one posted above, but with the right valueWhere:day/dag is an int from 1~5 representing Monday~Fridayblock_start/blok_start is an int that represents when the course starts (Time block, left side of table)block_end/blok_eind is an int that represent in what block the course endsclassroom/lokaal is the classroom's code the course is inteacher/leraar is the teacher's ID course/vak is the ID of the courseBasic HTML Structure for above data The codeHTML Python <code>  [ {

Read the n lines of a big text file," The smallest file I have has > 850k lines and every line is of unknown length. The goal is to read n lines from this file in the browser. Reading it fully is not going to happen.Here is the HTML <input type=""file"" name=""file"" id=""file""> and the JS I have: Obviously, the problem here is that it tries to first real the whole file and then split it by newline. So no matter of n, it will try to read the whole file, and eventually read nothing when the file is big.How should I do it?Note: I am willing to delete the whole function and start from scratch, given that I will be able to console.log() every line that we read.*""every line is of unknown length"" -> means that the file is something like this: Edit:The way to go would be something like filereader api on big files, but I can't see how I can modify that to read n lines of the file...By using Uint8Array to string in Javascript too, one can do from there: but this may not read the last line as a whole, so how are you going to determine the lines later? For example here is what it printed: <code>  var n = 10;var reader = new FileReader();reader.onload = function(progressEvent) { // Entire file console.log(this.result); // By lines var lines = this.result.split('\n'); for (var line = 0; line < n; line++) { console.log(lines[line]); }}; (0, (1, 2))(1, (4, 5, 6))(2, (7))(3, (8)) var view = new Uint8Array(fr.result);var string = new TextDecoder(""utf-8"").decode(view);console.log(""Chunk "" + string); ((7202), (u'11330875493', u'2554375661'))((1667), (u'9079074735', u'6883914476',",Read n lines of a big text file

Replacing Boostrap Dropdown with Dropup (Different activity on two near identical implementations)," I'm working on a project over at github pages, which I replace a bootstrap .dropdown with .dropup if the div's overflow-y: scroll will cause the dropdown menu to be cutoff / overflow. You can see the function working properly at this jsfiddle. Notice if you click on the ellipsis icon to the right on the top rows, it will drop down, if you click on the icon on the bottom rows, it will drop up. Now, my actual implementation (github page), the code is exactly the same (below), but it wants to replace all .dropdown classes with .dropup when opened, including the top-most row which gets cut off, seen in the photo below. I've been struggling with this for a week and can't quite figure it out. I've tried a few different things that I thought fixed it but ended up just being a hack and didn't work on mobile, or replaced some but not all etc. Here is the Javascript / jQuery I'm using, which can be seen in the jsfiddle and my github source here. Edit: To clear up any confusion, here's an example of the behavior without my added .dropup function. jsfiddle Notice when you click the last menu item, it opens the menu but requires scrolling. I specifically want to remove the .dropdown class and add .dropup in this case, so no scrolling is required. <code>  $(document).on(""shown.bs.dropdown"", "".dropdown"", function () { // calculate the required sizes, spaces var $ul = $(this).children("".dropdown-menu""); var $button = $(this).children("".song-menu""); var ulOffset = $ul.offset(); // how much space would be left on the top if the dropdown opened that direction var spaceUp = (ulOffset.top - $button.height() - $ul.height()) - $('#playlist').scrollTop(); // how much space is left at the bottom var spaceDown = $('#playlist').scrollTop() + $('#playlist').height() - ((ulOffset.top + 10) + $ul.height()); // switch to dropup only if there is no space at the bottom AND there is space at the top, or there isn't either but it would be still better fit if (spaceDown < 0 && (spaceUp >= 0 || spaceUp > spaceDown)) $(this).addClass(""dropup"");}).on(""hidden.bs.dropdown"", "".dropdown"", function() { // always reset after close $(this).removeClass(""dropup"");});",Replacing Bootstrap Dropdown with Dropup (Different activity on two near identical implementations)

This media media query does not do the job:  <code>  var b = document.getElementById (""menu-button"");b.addEventListener(""click"", showMenu, false);var i = 0;function showMenu () { i++; if(i % 2 == 1) document.getElementById(""menu"").style.display = ""block""; else document.getElementById(""menu"").style.display = ""none"";} @media screen and (min-width:640px) { #menu { display: block; }}",Hiding and showing element based on screen size

Android: Is it possible to pass different value then link in hyperlink tag(<a> tag)?," May be this question is already asked or duplicate of another question, but I didn't get any solution for my search.Here are the links which I followed for my question:Link1 Link2Actually, my question is related to sharing HTML text in android default intent with an ACTION_SEND. When I am trying to create a hyperlink to URL with different value then it is showing a simple text of value. That is not clickable as a link.Here is how I am doing: For body2:When I share the text using Gmail then in email hyperlinked text will come as a normal text. Simply ""Click Me"". I checked it on desktop browser also. But there also it is same. I checked this text in Inspect Element(You can get Inspect Element of a browser page like: Right click on browser page>> In popup window click at the bottom Inspect OR refer Inspect Element) format and found there was no tag for hyperlink text. For body1:It's working and I got the URL as a hyperlink in the email, but I got the URL as a hyperlink I don't want to show the same URL in email rather than there should be some hint value as body2 format. This format can be achieved by direct URL sharing in the body no need of tag.So finally my search is, Is there any way in Android for sharing hyperlink text with different hint value rather than as of link(URL). <code>  Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);intent.setType(""text/html"");String link = ""https://www.android.com/"";String linkValue = ""Click Me"";String body1 = ""<a href=\"""" + link + ""\"">"" + link+ ""</a>"";//I don't want thisString body2 = ""<a href=\"""" + link + ""\"">"" + linkValue + ""</a>"";//This is not workingintent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, Html.fromHtml(body2));startActivity(Intent.createChooser(intent, ""Share With""));",How to pass hyperlink to Gmail in Intent ACTION_SEND?

Variables and functions?," Yes, I know that this is probably a very stupid question, but this has been bugging me for a while. Ok, so I have been learning JavaScript for a while now and have understood everything perfectly. . .except for function ""parameters"" (I believe they are called). I was taught that they work like so: This makes perfect sense to me. However, recently, I've come across some that were a little different. What I seriously do not understand is why the updateTimer always needs date within the parentheses, when the variable date is an already existing variable within the global scope. Same with startTimer. I don't understand why I need to pass that in. Why not just access the variable within the function, as they do have a global scope, and be done with it. Instead I need to pass in the variable as a parameter, for the function to work.I've tried and tried, but the only way to make the function work is by passing in the variables. Why is that???As I am still learning, I've searched the internet for more information on functions and their parameters, but all show me something similar to my first example. I know this is all probably just going over my head, but for the life of me, I just do not understand.Note: I am still learning, so sorry if this whole question is plain stupid.Also, the the code for the JS that I am having a problem with won't actually run. This is due to me not wanting to put in all of my code, but rather just the code I am having trouble with.  <code>  function test(number) { document.write(number); };test(1);test(12); var counterDays = document.getElementById('days');var counterHours = document.getElementById('hours');var counterMinutes = document.getElementById('minutes');var counterSeconds = document.getElementById('seconds');var date = new Date('December 28, 2016 00:00:00');function updateTimer(date) { var time = date - new Date(); return { 'days': Math.floor(time / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)), 'hours': Math.floor((time/(1000 * 60 * 60)) % 24), 'minutes': Math.floor((time / 1000 / 60) % 60), 'seconds': Math.floor((time / 1000) % 60), 'total': time };};function startTimer(counterDays, counterHours, counterMinutes, counterSeconds, date) { var timerInterval = setInterval(function() { var timer = updateTimer(date); //Changes the text of the 'counter' counterDays.innerHTML = timer.days; counterHours.innerHTML = timer.hours; counterMinutes.innerHTML = timer.minutes; counterSeconds.innerHTML = timer.seconds; window.onload = function() { startTimer(counterDays, counterHours, counterMinutes, counterSeconds, date); }; <span id=""days"">&nbsp;</span> <span id=""hours"">&nbsp;</span> <span id=""minutes"">&nbsp;</span> <span id=""seconds"">&nbsp;</span>",Why Use Function Parameters Vs.

I'm literally setting the state to be the same as the event.target.checked in the line above it!But it always returns the opposite of what it should.Same goes for when I use !this.state.barClubLounge; If it starts false, on my first click it remains false, even though whether the checkbox is checked or not is based off of the state!!It's a crazy paradox and I have no idea whats going on, please help! <code>  class NightlifeTypes extends Component {constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { barClubLounge: false, seeTheTown: true, eventsEntertainment: true, familyFriendlyOnly: false } this.handleOnChange = this.handleOnChange.bind(this);}handleOnChange = (event) => { if(event.target.className == ""barClubLounge"") { this.setState({barClubLounge: event.target.checked}); console.log(event.target.checked) console.log(this.state.barClubLounge) }}render() { return ( <input className=""barClubLounge"" type='checkbox' onChange={this.handleOnChange} checked={this.state.barClubLounge}/> )} handleOnChange = (event) => { if(event.target.className == ""barClubLounge"") { this.setState({barClubLounge: !this.state.barClubLounge}); console.log(event.target.checked) console.log(this.state.barClubLounge)}",Why calling setState method doesn't mutate the state immediately?

Bootstrap Navbar collapse point < 767px," This is an OLD question for Bootstrap 3 -> changing the collapse point for the navbar, but the methodologies suggested here:https://coderwall.com/p/wpjw4w/change-the-bootstrap-navbar-breakpointand here:Bootstrap 3 Navbar Collapsedo not work for collapsing below 768px, it only seems to work for extending the collapse point, not retracting it. I have a particular situation where my navbar has 3 buttons, so it doesn't need to collapse so early. I would like it to collapse at 420px instead.Is there a CSS solution to this?

Horizontal slider start slide again from first one," I don't know why people's are not answering this question.I'm making a horizontal infinite loop slider.

Add spacing between vertically stacked columns in Twitter Bootstrap 4," Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a good way to manage vertical spacing between columns that transition from a horizontal stack to a vertical stack at certain breakpoints. There does seem to be a solution when a form is involved, but that's not the situation here. I've tried this solution, but it doesn't work when there are multiple columns that wrap in a row. To illustrate my scenario, here's the structure of my HTML: https://jsfiddle.net/b74a3kbs/6/At medium-device size (md) and above, I'd like there there to be spacing between the two ""rows"" of columns, but no spacing above the ""first row"" of 3 columns and none below the ""second row"" of 3 columns. When the columns stack vertically at below the medium-device size (md), I'd like there to be spacing between each of the columns, but none above the first child and none below the last child.Ideally, the solution would work regardless of how many columns (e.g., 3, 5, 6, 12) are contained within the row. <code> ",Add spacing between vertically stacked columns in Bootstrap 4

"How to do a synchronous require of Webpack build module, from outside of Webpack build"," Say I have an HTML file like so: as the comment says in the script tag, I am trying to figure out: how I can import/require something from inside the Webpack build from just about any old JavaScript code?Is it possible? How? ...I could set global variables in the build, but I am wondering if there is another better way.Note:I would be willing to use Browserify instead of Webpack to create the bundle/build, if that makes it easier to require modules from the build, from outside of the build.I tried doing this with RequireJS and SystemJS - these two tools would make it much easier to do what I want to do. But apparently it's pretty hard to create deep builds from NPM packages with RequireJS or SystemJS, and in this case I need a deep build that includes many NPM deps. I even tried TypeScript transpiler to create a deep build, to no avail. So it seems like it's gotta be either Browserify or Webpack, but I am open to anything that might work.Note that if we used AMD or SystemJS, this would be straightforward: But using Webpack/Browserify makes it a little trickier to do what I want to do. <code>  <!DOCTYPE html> <meta charset=""UTF-8""> <title>Suman tests</title> <head> <script src=""../dist/suman.js""></script> <-- webpack build here // how can I do a synchronous require() here, from something // inside the Webpack build? </script></head><body></body></html> <head> <script src=""../dist/suman-amd.js""></script> <--AMD build here <script src=""../dist/suman-system.js""></script> <--SystemJS build here <script> // using AMD define(['/a-module-from-amd-build'], function(myMod){ // my unique code goes here }); // or with SystemJS System.register('my-module', ['a-module-from-system-build'], function(myMod){ // my unique code goes here }); </script></head>","How to do a synchronous require of Webpack build module, from *outside* of Webpack build"

EDIT:The problem is when i set fixed font-size within width range the font is resized anyway relative to svg size.  <code>  #svg-container { width: 100%; padding-bottom: 70%; overflow: hidden; border: 1px solid red;}#svg-container svg text tspan { font-size: 14px;}@media (min-height: 800px) { #svg-container svg text tspan { font-size: 50px; }} <div id=""svg-container""><svg xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"" xmlns:cc=""http://creativecommons.org/ns#"" xmlns:rdf=""http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"" xmlns:svg=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:sodipodi=""http://sodipodi.sourceforge.net/DTD/sodipodi-0.dtd"" xmlns:inkscape=""http://www.inkscape.org/namespaces/inkscape"" version=""1.1"" viewBox=""0 0 500 350"" data-name=""Layer 1"" id=""Layer_1"" inkscape:version=""0.91 r13725"" sodipodi:docname=""Desktop_Enhanced.svg"" width=""100%"" style=""position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0;"" > <sodipodi:namedview pagecolor=""#ffffff"" bordercolor=""#666666"" borderopacity=""1"" objecttolerance=""10"" gridtolerance=""10"" guidetolerance=""10"" inkscape:pageopacity=""0"" inkscape:pageshadow=""2"" inkscape:window-width=""1280"" inkscape:window-height=""961"" id=""namedview51"" showgrid=""false"" inkscape:zoom=""1.0054235"" inkscape:cx=""231.42799"" inkscape:cy=""361.93137"" inkscape:window-x=""1272"" inkscape:window-y=""-8"" inkscape:window-maximized=""1"" inkscape:current-layer=""Layer_1"" fit-margin-bottom=""150"" /> <metadata id=""metadata75""> <rdf:RDF> <cc:Work rdf:about=""""> <dc:format>image/svg+xml</dc:format> <dc:type rdf:resource=""http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage"" /> <dc:title>Desktop</dc:title> </cc:Work> </rdf:RDF> </metadata> <defs id=""defs3""> <style id=""style5"">.cls-1{fill:#da1f26;}.cls-2{fill:#252e43;}.cls-3{fill:#d1d3d4;}</style> </defs> <title id=""title7"">Desktop</title> <polyline id=""polyline9"" points=""329.4 62.24 343.54 76.39 329.4 90.53"" class=""cls-1"" style=""fill:#da1f26"" transform=""translate(59.579252,-43.513817)"" /> <polyline id=""polyline11"" points=""333.56 328.83 347.7 342.97 333.56 357.11"" class=""cls-2"" style=""fill:#252e43"" transform=""translate(59.579252,-43.513817)"" /> <path id=""path35"" d=""m 394.84925,294.48618 -25,0 c -57.81,0 -77.28,-34.66 -96.1,-68.18 -15.35,-27.34 -29.86,-53.16 -63.9,-53.16 l -31.27,0 0,10 31.3,0 c 28.19,0 40.7,22.27 55.18,48.06 9.68,17.23 19.69,35.06 35.5,49.13 18.26,16.22 40.93,24.15 69.33,24.15 l 25,0 z"" class=""cls-2"" inkscape:connector-curvature=""0"" style=""fill:#252e43"" /> <path id=""path43"" d=""m 390.97925,27.876183 -21.09,0 c -28.4,0 -51.07,7.9 -69.32,24.15 -15.81,14.08 -25.82,31.9 -35.5,49.129997 -14.48,25.79 -27,48.06 -55.18,48.06 l -31.31,0 0,10 31.3,0 c 34,0 48.54,-25.82 63.9,-53.16 18.8,-33.569997 38.3,-68.179997 96.11,-68.179997 l 21.09,0 z"" class=""cls-1"" inkscape:connector-curvature=""0"" style=""fill:#da1f26"" /> <path id=""path45"" d=""m 429.38925,17.956183 a 14.92,14.92 0 1 0 14.92,14.92 14.92,14.92 0 0 0 -14.92,-14.92 z m 0,21 a 6.08,6.08 0 1 1 6.08,-6.08 6.08,6.08 0 0 1 -6.08,6.08 z"" class=""cls-1"" inkscape:connector-curvature=""0"" style=""fill:#da1f26"" /> <path id=""path47"" d=""m 433.38925,284.53618 a 14.92,14.92 0 1 0 14.92,14.95 14.92,14.92 0 0 0 -14.92,-14.95 z m 0,21 a 6.08,6.08 0 1 1 6.09,-6.05 6.08,6.08 0 0 1 -6.09,6.05 z"" class=""cls-2"" inkscape:connector-curvature=""0"" style=""fill:#252e43"" /> <flowRoot style=""font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:40px;line-height:125%;font-family:sans-serif;letter-spacing:0px;word-spacing:0px;fill:#000000;fill-opacity:1;stroke:none;stroke-width:1px;stroke-linecap:butt;stroke-linejoin:miter;stroke-opacity:1"" id=""flowRoot4236"" xml:space=""preserve"" transform=""translate(0,-72.53)""><flowRegion id=""flowRegion4238""><rect y=""179.54243"" x=""18.988897"" height=""58.373276"" width=""94.241196"" id=""rect4240"" /></flowRegion><flowPara id=""flowPara4242"">ZakadaZ</flowPara></flowRoot> <text x=""27.791037"" y=""169.90349"" font-size=""20px"" id=""text49-1"" style=""font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:normal;font-size:15px;line-height:125%;font-family:sans-serif;-inkscape-font-specification:'sans-serif, Bold';text-align:start;writing-mode:lr-tb;text-anchor:start;fill:#252e43;fill-opacity:1"" sodipodi:linespacing=""125%""> <tspan sodipodi:role=""line"" id=""tspan4528"" x=""27.791037"" y=""169.90349"">PLEASE CHOOSE</tspan> </text></svg></div>",SVG: fixed font size

How to create a flex item that has a percentage basis and is able to shrink," As can be seen in this JS-Fiddle, I basically try to use this CSS to create two divs that should fullfill these requirements:If twice the space of the wider item is available, both should use 50% width (that works)If not enough space for both items is available, they should wrap (that works)If enough space is available for both items, but less than twice the width of the wider one, the narrower item should shrink (that does NOT work, it wraps)I don't understand this behavior, because I have set flex-shrink for the flex items, so they should be able to shrink - but they don't: If the narrower item would be less than 50% wide, it wraps. (Tested on Firefox and Chrome) <code>  .m { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;}.l_1 { background-color: red; flex: 1 1 50%;}.r_1 { background-color: yellow; flex: 1 1 50%;} <div class=m> <div class=l_1> left_______________________________________________X </div> <div class=r_1> right </div></div>",How to create a flex item that shrinks before it wraps?
Owl Carousel 2 items stack on top of each other," I'm trying to group images into groups of 8, and use each grouping as a separate slide for Owl Carousel. However, rather than stacking horizontally like normal, the groupings are just stacked vertically.My owl settings: The php generating the HTML (uses ACF gallery plugin for WordPress) I got the following CSS that applies to the carousel: I've included owl.carousel.min.css and owl.theme.default.min.css, and I'm running the latest version of jQuery. No errors in the console.I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it, but one thing to note is that I use negative margins on some elements like my header and footer to stretch out background colors. Perhaps this is affecting things? <code>  //Gallery carouselgallery();function gallery(){ $('.gallery').owlCarousel({ margin: 10, nav: true, items: 1, });} <!-- Gallery Thumbs --><?php $images = get_field('gallery');if( $images ): ?> <div class=""gallery""> <div class=""gallery-group""><!-- Group the images in pairs of 8 --> <?php $i = 0; ?> <?php foreach( $images as $image ): ?> <?php $caption = $image['caption']; ?> <a data-fancybox=""gallery"" href=""<?php echo $image['url']; ?>""> <img src=""<?php echo $image['sizes']['thumbnail']; ?>"" alt=""<?php echo $image['alt']; ?>"" /> </a> <?php if ($caption): ?> <p><?php echo $caption; ?></p> <?php endif; ?> <?php $i++; ?> <?php if ($i % 8 == 0): ?> </div> <div class=""gallery-group""> <?php endif; ?> <?php endforeach; ?> </div> </div><?php endif; ?> .hentry{ position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);}.gallery{ width: 1000px;}",Owl Carousel - Items are stacking on top of each other

How to prevent half-pixel SVG shift on Retina?," I have a HTML webpage with SVG image. I get a problem (excess white line, shown on the picture below) on the webpage when I visit it using iOS Safari or Android Browser. The screenshot resolution is 2x, the saw edge is a SVG image.I've found out that it happens when the page Y-position of the SVG image is not an integer amount of CSS pixels (px), i.e. with px. The browser rounds the SVG image position to integer px when it renders the webpage while doesn't round the other elements positions. That's why the px line appears.You can reproduce the problem using the snippet below (or this CodePen). You should run the snippet on a device with a high pixel density. You can also reproduce it in desktop Safari if you go to the responsive design mode and pick iPhone or iPad. How to prevent px SVG shift on iOS Safari and Android Browser? Is it a bug and I should report it to WebKit developers?

Turn an image of stained glass into clickable elements," I need to make a pattern of many non rectangular shapes. Each shape must be interactive and reveal an image on click.The request is to take an image of a stained glass and turn it into a webpage that is filled with the image. Each pane must be clickable, similar to those you see in churches, but on first load each shape is black and white and on click it reveals the color of the glass.I imagine that this solution will encompass 2 parts, the color version of the entire stained glass image and a black and white version ontop of it. Then somehow each little glass pane on click needs to hide the black and white portion underneath it to reveal the color image underneath.I have no idea what the best solution to go about this would be and haven't found anything useful to help along the way of doing something similar with shapes and so random interactive areas. I have inserted an example below of the outcome, imagine each glass portion is clickable and on click reveals the color.The white lines just designates that each pane behaves independently of the others. <code> ",Pattern of irregular clickable shapes

How can I sort DOM elements triggering the least amount of reflows?," I've got the following example. If I want to order these div's in an ascending order (1,2,3,4,5). I would normally do a loop and append the div's in order to the parent div. This will however mean I always make 5 changes to the dom (regardless of the order of the div's), one for each div.You can however use the .insertBefore() method to order the div's correctly with only 2 changes! Question 1 By making only 2 changes to the DOM I assume less reflow ocours, making the '2 change' sorting action faster than the '5 change'sorting action. Is this correct?Question 2 What sort of method/algorithm would be able to figure out to only do the insert 1 before 2 and 5 behind 4?Question 3 (bonus) Will this 'optimized' algorithm still be faster as the amount of items incease? Range 10 - 100 - 1.000 - 10.000 - 100.000Maybe to clarify: I am not searching for a way to figure out the order (1,2,3,4,5) in the most optimal way.

Purpose of nomodule attribute if default is text/javascript?," I am not clearly understanding why the nomodule attribute exists in the new browsers that support ES6 modules.In HTML 5, the type attribute is optional and defaults to text/javascript: The type attribute gives the language of the script or format of the data.

The default, which is used if the attribute is absent, is ""text/javascript"".It doesn't default to <script type=""module"" src=""module.js""></script>. Has this default changed? If not, why would nomodule be necessary?

How can I generate large data that the user can download client side in JavaScript?," Checking MDN I see there used to be BlobBuilder and that I could call blobBuilder.append to continue adding data to a blob but according to MDN BlobBuilder is deprecated in favor of the Blob constructor. Unfortunately the Blob constructor requires all data in memory at construction time. My data is too large to be in memory at construction time. Looking at the File API see nothing there either.Is there a way to generate large data client side and put it in a blob? For example say I wanted to render a 16k by 16k image. Uncompressed that's a 1gig image.I have an algorithm that can generate it 1 or a few scan lines at a time but I need way to write those scan lines into a file/blob and then when finished I can use the standard way to let the user download that blob but, I can't seem to find an API that let's me stream data into a blob.The only thing I can think of is apparently I can make a Blob from Blobs so I suppose I can write each part of the image to a separate blob and then send all the blobs to another blob to get a big blob.Is that the only solution? Seems kind of um .... strange. Though if it works then \_()_/ Someone voted to close as they don't understand the question. Here's another explanation.Write 4 gig to a blob The code above will crash because the browser will kill the page for using too much memory. Using BlobBuilder I could have done something like That would not have run out of memory because there is never more than 1meg of data around. The browser can flush the data being appended to the BlobBuilder out to disk.What's the new way to achieve writing 4 gig to a blob? Is it only writing lots of small blobs and then using those to generate a larger one or is there some more traditional way where traditional means steaming into some object/file/blob/storage. <code>  const arrays = []; for (let i = 0; i < 4096; ++i) { arrays.push(new Uint8Array(1024 * 1024)); // 1 meg } // arrays now holds 4 gig of data const blob = new Blob(arrays); const builder = new BlobBuilder(); for (let i = 0; i < 4096; ++i) { const data = new Uint8Array(1024 * 1024); // 1 meg builder.append(data); } const blob = builder.getBlob(...);",Is there a way to stream data into a blob (or generate a giant blob)

html grid layout disrupted by svg child element," I'm trying to make a page with a simple 3x3 grid layout: header top, footer bottom, two sidebars, and the main display. Everything works fine until I add the SVG element that should fill the main-display div: The whole grid layout gets confused at this point, with the browser eliminating the header, extending the page below the height: 100% that I have declared, etc. I can easily ""fix"" this by setting my SVG max-height and max-width arbitrarily small (below ~60% in Firefox 62.0.3; in Safari 12.0, <90%). But that isn't really a fix since it leaves a conspicuous gap (a huge one in Firefox). I much prefer to size my SVG 100% to fill its space in the grid. I must be missing something. What am I doing wrong? Edit: Adding a screenshot of what I want and (one version of) what I have. Here is what I have. Here is what I want.The stylesheet for what you see is below. The only difference between the two images is the change in max-width and max-height from 10% to 100%.  <code>  <div class=""main""> <svg viewBox=""0 0 500 500""></svg></div> * { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; } body { display: grid; border-style: solid; // to show that body renders improperly border-color: red; grid-template-columns: 3fr 9fr 2fr; grid-template-rows: 1fr 10fr 1fr; width: 100vw; height: 100vh; } div { border: solid black 1px; // to show div positions } .header { grid-column: 1 / 4; grid-row: 1; } .main { grid-column: 2; grid-row: 2; } .side1 { grid-column: 1; grid-row: 2; } .side2 { grid-column: 3; grid-row: 2; } .footer { grid-column: 1 / 4; grid-row: 3; } svg { max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%; }",HTML grid layout disrupted by SVG child element

Render dynamically changing images with same filenames in flask - Python," I have a flask view function as below: Outputs.html: I use the flask view function to display an image through the outputs.html file. The catch here is that the static image file that is served keeps changing every time based on user inputs. In other words, I keep overwriting the image file based on the inputs the user has selected. But the problem is that the changing image file is not served. The old image file that was used for first time render is only displayed for every new input of the user. I have already referred to old posts regarding serving dynamic content in flask. But none of them served useful. <code>  @app.route('/myfunc', methods = ['POST', 'GET'])def myfunc(): var = request.form[""samplename""] selected_ecg=ecg.loc[ecg['Patient ID'].isin([var])] selected_ecg = selected_ecg.drop('Patient ID', 1) arr = np.array(selected_ecg) y = arr.T x=np.array(range(1,189)) plot.plot(x,y) #Remove the old file os.remove(""static\graph.png"") #Now save the new image file plot.savefig(""static\graph.png"") return render_template(""outputs.html"") <html> <head> </head>",Render dynamically changing images with same filenames in Flask

Best approach to hiding an absolutely positioned <div> gradient when horizontally scrolling?," I have an example of my current work here: https://jsfiddle.net/pv5xroLc/My problem is that when the table in my example is fully scrolled to the right, the faded gradient still covers part of my table even though it cannot be scrolled further, thus it makes the last column harder to read. I am wondering what the best solution to hiding this gradient is while still making it clear that the table can be scrolled horizontally (this is going to appear on mobile).Currently, my html structure is as follows: The .fader element has an ::after pseudo-element which contains the ""fader"" on it, which is an absolutely positioned element with the linear-gradient I'm using to indicate that the element can be scrolled horizontally. The .scrollable element is a horizontally scrolling element that holds my table.I currently have two solutions I have considered:Add a listener to check when the scrollbar has reached the right side (like this example), then hide or fade out the gradient. The problem with this is that I have more than one of these faded tables on the page, and I'm not sure what the most effective way to setup these listeners would be. I'm using Vue.js with this, so I'm not sure if this could/should be a directive or just a listener set on the page for each of these tables.Add some blank space to the right of the table, so you could scroll a little bit past the end of the actual table and the gradient would just blend into the background. I've tried adding padding and margins to both the table and the .scrollable element but it does not add any extra space after the table.If anyone has suggestions for what they think I should do, it would be greatly appreciated. <code>  <div class=""fader""> <div class=""scrollable""> *content* </div></div>",Best approach to hide an absolutely positioned <div> when horizontally scrolling?

How to use PHP to insert HTML tags to string by offsets mantaining a valid HTML?," I'm trying to add HTML tags between words inside a string (wrap words by html tags i.e. HTML annotations). The positions where the HTML tags should be written are delimited by an array of offsets, for example: So to annotate the following HTML text ($source) with the following HTML tag ($tag). That is wrapped the characters delimited by the $annotationPositions array (without taking into account the HTML tags of source). the result should be the following (https://jsfiddle.net/cotg2pn1/): How can I program the next function: taking into account that the HTML tags of the input string must not be taken into account when counting the characters described in the $annotationCharactersPositions array and each insertion of an annotation (i.e $tag) in the $source text must be taken into account for the encapsulation/annotation of the following annotations.The idea of this whole process is that given a input text (that may or may not contain HTML tags) a group of characters would be annotated (belonging to one or several words) so that the result would have the selected characters (through an array that defines where each annotation begins and ends) wrapped by HTML tag that can vary (a, span, mark) with a variable number of html attributes (name, class, id, data-*). In addition the result must be a well-formed valid HTML document so that if any annotation is between several annotations, the html should be writing in the output accordingly.

Is it some secret application properties that need to write? Or there is a config code that has to write?

Bootstrap Modal Iframe iOS 12 Hidden Behind Content," I am having an issue with Bootstrap 4.1 modals displayed within iframes in Safari on iOS 12. Every other browser tested works as expected (even Safari on iOS 11). The issue seems to be specific to iOS 12. I have created a minimal example demonstrating the issue. The first two buttons seem to function as expected, however the last 4 you can see the issue, with each one being worse as you traverse downward, where the last one disappearing all together when you attempt to scroll or focus on an element inside of the modal (see below screenshots):I will note that we are handling this functionality in a way that may be a tad unorthodox, as instead of allowing the content of the iframe to scroll, we adjust it's height after it has loaded by passing messages between parent and child via a message event handler and postMessage: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessageThis is where I suspect something has gone afoul (but have yet been able to track it down (and as mentioned previously this is only an issue on ios devices running version 12)).EditIt has recently been discovered that this issue is not specific to Safari on iOS 12, but chrome as well.Code below is from the previous minimal example link:Parent (/modal-test/index.html): Child (/modal-test/frameable.html) <code>  <!DOCTYPE html><html lang=""en""><head> <meta charset=""UTF-8""> <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no""> <title>Title</title> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""./bootstrap.min.css""> <script src=""./jquery.min.js""></script> <script src=""./popper.min.js""></script> <script src=""./bootstrap.min.js""></script> <script> $(document).ready(function(){ $ifCon = $(""#ifCon"");

ReactJs _ SVG : How can I center my clip-path's text relatively to the viewport and display all the clip-path's text?," Here my React component demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/epic-brown-osiq1, I am now using the viewBox's values, getBBox and getBoundingClientRect() to realize some calculations in order to position my element. Currently I have entered raw value based on the return the console have provided me from the getBoundingClientRect()'s logs. You can see it on the element I have implemented the getBoundingClientRect() on, namely the <svg>'s root element and the clip-path's text's element. Better but the text is more place tower the center of the screen that really aligned on center of the text's box-you can see the ""So""'s word is at the start of the ""Food""'s word instead of being aligned on the box's center. So I am at this point currently. Thanks for the feedback.*note: You will see some comments providing information or parts of my former trials inside the sandbox.What my code does ? concretely I display a clip-path's text with some animated panel travelling the clip-path - this is the color_panel_group's element- giving some dynamic to the composition.There is also a shadow behind the text to give some depth to the composition.Expectation: display a clip-path's text responsively positioned at the vertical and horizontal's centers of the viewport. Problem: My clip-path hides a part of the text and my trials to center the element relative to viewport fails to be fructuous. What I have tried: I have tried to play with the width of the element and the x's positions of the element -mainly text, clip-path, symbol and both case. Even tried to play with the use element by implementing some class in it, but at the end of the day very approximative result outcomed. Also In tspan and symbol I have tried to play with x's attribute, again with very approximative outcomes. I have tried to play with position absolute and a relative container -mainly on the SVG's CSS selector directly-, still with approximative outcomes.I am wondering what I am missing. Maybe someone can bring some explanation on my code's behavior?Here my second presentation's resulting code (approximately what React component produces): Thanks for any hint. <code>  body { background: orange;}svg { background: green; display: block; margin: auto; position: relative; z-index: 2; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100vw; height: 100vh;}.component { min-width: 100vw; min-height: 100vh; font-size: 100%;}.fade_in_background { opacity: 1; visibility: visible; transition: all 1.5s ease-out 0s;}.brandtype { margin: auto; text-align: center;}.brandtype_use { position: absolute; transform: translate(-112.65px, 0)}.clipPath_text { text-align: center;}.color_panel_group { padding: 25px;}.shape_animation { transform-origin: 0; transform: scale(0, 1) translate(0, 0); animation: moving-panel 3s 1.5s 1 alternate forwards;}.shadow { transform: translate(10px, 10px)}.shape_animation_shadow { fill: black; fill-opacity: .505; transition: all 1.3s ease-out 0.3s;}.brandtype { font-size: 6.8em;}@keyframes moving-panel { to { transform: scale(1, 1) translate(20px, 0); }} <div class=""component""> <svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"" viewBox=""0 0 965 657""> <defs> <symbol id=""panel_animation"" y=""0""> <clipPath class=""clipPath_text"" id=""clipPath_text""><text class=""brandtype"" word-spacing=""-.45em""> <tspan x=""0%"" y=""50%"" dy=""1.6em"">So</tspan> <tspan x=""0%"" y=""50%"" dy=""3em"">Food</tspan> </text></clipPath> <g class=""shadow"" clip-path=""url(#clipPath_text)""> <rect class=""shape_animation shape_animation_shadow"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"" x=""-25px""> </rect> </g> <g class=""color_panel_group"" clip-path=""url(#clipPath_text)""> <rect class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#F2385A"" width=""100%"" height=""100%""></rect> <rect class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#F5A503"" width=""80%"" height=""100%""></rect> <rect class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#E9F1DF"" width=""60%"" height=""100%""></rect> <rect class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#56D9CD"" width=""40%"" height=""100%""></rect> <rect id=""shape_animation_ref"" class=""shape_animation"" fill=""#3AA1BF"" width=""20%"" height=""100%"" x=""-25px""> </rect> </g> </symbol> </defs> <rect width=""100%"" height=""100%"" filter=""url(#background_light)""></rect> <use width=""500px"" height=""100%"" x=""50%"" xlink:href=""#panel_animation"" class=""brandtype_use""></use> </svg></div>",How can I center my clip-path's text relatively to the viewport and display all the clip-path's text?
Why is overflow-y creating a horizontal scroll bar?," I have two panels side by side. The right-hand one contains species names, which should not wrap (they're small enough to occupy only a small part of the screen). The left-hand panel contains more things, and occupy most of the screen. Here's my code. When there's no scrollbar, the width of the right-hand panel is correct. But as soon as I add a vertical scrollbar (overflow-y: auto), it's width gets much smaller, creating also a horizontal scrollbar. Why? And how to solve it? I only want the vertical scrollbar. The width of the panel should be enough to contain all the words on it.  <code>  html,body { height: 100%;}body { display: flex; margin: 0; overflow-y: hidden;}#left { background-color: skyblue; flex-grow: 1; padding: 1em;}#right { background-color: indianRed; white-space: nowrap; padding: 1em; display: flex; flex-direction: column;} <div id='left'>Some text wide enough to compete with the red panel -- some more words needed.</div><div id='right'><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p></div> html,body { height: 100%;}body { display: flex; margin: 0; overflow-y: hidden;}#left { background-color: skyblue; flex-grow: 1; padding: 1em;}#right { background-color: indianRed; white-space: nowrap; padding: 1em; display: flex; flex-direction: column; overflow-y: auto;} <div id='left'>Some text wide enough to compete with the red panel -- some more words needed.</div><div id='right'><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p><p>Some names.</p><p>Some names a little larger.</p></div>",Why is overflow-y: hidden creating a horizontal scroll bar in my flex layout?
CSS grid max-content across columns," I am trying to use the max-content option of grid-template-columns in such a way that all my columns have the width of the widest cell in the grid.

"Does rel=""home"" on an <a> tag do anything helpful?"," I see this a lot on site title links in WordPress themes (probably because Underscores does it and everyone copies that): I cannot find even a semi-authoritative statement anywhere that rel=""home"" on an anchor tag is used meaningfully today by any browser, screen reader, or other user agent.

Using it on a <link> has some pedigree from HTML v3, and there's reference to it in the wild from 2002. But I haven't seen anything about the <a> tag usage.So, is including it helpful for anything/anyone?

WebGL Reading pixels properly from offscreen canvas," I know there are a lot of resources on this, but none of them have worked for me.Some are: webgl readpixels is always returning 0,0,0,0, and this one: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44869599/readpixels-from-webgl-canvas\as well as this one: Read pixels from a WebGL texture but none of them have been either helpful or successful.The goal: Render an offscreen canvas with a WebGL shader, then use that as a texture in a separate WebGL shader.Notes:For these WebGL shaders, I'm using a generic vertex shader used for pixel shaders, specifically, a raytracer/raymarcher. This is: attribute vec2 a_position; void main() { gl_Position = vec4(a_position.xy, 0.0, 1.0); }. This vertex shader is inputted two triangles that cover the screen, so basically the fragment shader is doing all the work.Problem: In order to get the image data off of the offscreen canvas, I've tried these methods:The WebGL gl.readPixels function Using another canvas with getContext('2d') Both of these methods result in the capturedImageData array being filled with 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, . . . , which is obviously not right.If anybody has experience with this problem, help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!A direct link to the program is:https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/-/6289631977619456 <code>  var capturedImageData = new Float32Array(screenWidth * screenHeight * 4);gl.readPixels(0, 0, screenWidth, screenHeight, gl.RGBA, gl.FLOAT, capturedImageData); var offscreenCanvas = document.createElement(""canvas"");offscreenCanvas.width = screenWidth;offscreenCanvas.height = screenHeight;var ctx = offscreenCanvas.getContext('2d');ctx.drawImage(glCanvas, 0, 0);var capturedImageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, screenWidth, screenHeight);",WebGL Reading pixels properly from offscreen canvas [solved]
Why the div has height?," The w3c sendOn a block container element whose content is composed of inline-level elements, 'line-height' specifies the minimal height of line boxes within the element. The minimum height consists of a minimum height above the baseline and a minimum depth below it, exactly as if each line box starts with a zero-width inline box with the element's font and line height properties. We call that imaginary box a ""strut."" (The name is inspired by TeX.).https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#inline-box-heightBut when the span display is 'inline', why the div's height are 0?I am confused? <code>  div { background:red;} <div><span style=""display: inline-block""></span></div>",Why a div with an empty inline-block has height?
"Child's `height: 100%` is not parent's height, why?"," Both parent and child have box-sizing: border-box;.

For an unknown reason, the body of the center block is not correctly rendered in the code view.Perhaps my extensive css resets made my progress bar look differently than the bare code here.But its about the div with class name number that needs to be centered correctly, which is not at the moment.My Hacky Solution, Not Working Correctly and Not ElegantI tried wrapping the center piece with width:112% as a hack to the progress bar, to get the center block to perfectly middle, like so: However, while this does make the 50% appear perfectly horitontally centered, the end state 100% is now pushed beyond the div boundaries to the right, making the solution incorrect and unusable.Main Question and First Bounty (50 points)It would be nice to find another CSS (flex or calc) solution in which all three desirable states (see above three pictures) align perfectly, where the states fit the beginning state, the end state, and everything in between ""proportionally"".Bonus Question and Second Bounty (100 points)Part A) An elegant way to animate the progress (center piece and left colored bar) with only CSS, with an ease-in-ease-out motion, with a delay of 1 second after page load.Part B) The animation (and number) should start at 0% and the displayed number in the center piece then grows during the animation up to XX% (whatever was set in html as %) and ends with the right progress number and right horizontal progress location. <code>  body{margin: 100px; background: #CCC}.fullbar{ background-color: blue; width: 100%;}.progress{ background: green; margin: 10px 0 0 0; text-align: right; padding: 0 0px 1px 0px; line-height: 5px;}.number{ background: inherit; color: #FFF; padding: 4px; padding: 0 2px 1px 3px; } <div class=""fullbar""><div class=""progress"" style=""width:50%""> <div class=""number"">50%</div></div></div> <div class=""fullbar""> <div style=""width:112%""> <div class=""progress"" style=""width:50%""> <div class=""number"">50%</div> </div> </div></div>",Sophisticated proportional triple element progress bar design using only CSS
