"How to deal with ""java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"" error (64MB heap size)"," I am writing a client-side Swing application (graphical font designer) on Java 5. Recently, I am running into java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error because I am not being conservative on memory usage. The user can open unlimited number of files, and the program keeps the opened objects in the memory. After a quick research I found Ergonomics in the 5.0 Java Virtual Machine and others saying on Windows machine the JVM defaults max heap size as 64MB.Given this situation, how should I deal with this constraint?I could increase the max heap size using command line option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script. Besides, increasing to some finite max does not ultimately get rid of the issue.I could rewrite some of my code to persist objects to file system frequently (using database is the same thing) to free up the memory. It could work, but it's probably a lot work too.If you could point me to details of above ideas or some alternatives like automatic virtual memory, extending heap size dynamically, that will be great. <code> ","How to deal with ""java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"" error?"
java/hibernate (jpa) designing the server data reload," Our design has one jvm that is a jboss/webapp (read/write) that is used to maintain the data via hibernate (using jpa) to the db. The model has 10-15 persistent classes with 3-5 levels of depth in the relationships.We then have a separate jvm that is the server using this data. As it is running continuously we just have one long db session (read only). There is currently no intra-jvm cache involved - so we manually signal one jvm from the other.Now when the webapp changes some data, it signals the server to reload the changed data. What we have found is that we need to tell hibernate to purge the data and then reload it. Just doing a fetch/merge with the db does not do the job - mainly in respect of the objects several layers down the hierarchy. Any thoughts on whether there is anything fundamentally wrong with this design or if anyone is doing this and has had better luck with working with hibernate on the reloads.Thanks,Chris <code> ",How to maintain Hibernate cache consistency running two Java applications?

When to you use a JSP and when a Servlet?," I have an application that sends the customer to another site to handle the payments. The other site, outside of the customer, calls a page on our server to let us know what the status is of the payment. The called page checks the parameters that are given by the payment application and checks to see whether the transaction is known to us. It then updates the database to reflect the status. This is all done without any interaction with the customer.I have personally chosen to implement this functionality as a JSP since it is easier to just drop a file in the file system than to compile and package the file and then to add an entry into a configuration file.Considering the functionality of the page I would presume that a servlet would be the preferred option. The question(s) are: Is my presumption correct? Is there a real reason to use a servlet over a JSP? What are those reasons? <code> ",When do you use a JSP and when a Servlet?

Java 6 Excessive Memory," Does Java 6 consume more memory than you expect for largish applications?I have an application I have been developing for years, which has, until now taken about 30-40 MB in my particular test configuration; now with Java 6u10 and 11 it is taking several hundred while active. It bounces around a lot, anywhere between 50M and 200M, and when it idles, it does GC and drop the memory right down. In addition it generates millions of page faults. All of this is observed via Windows Task Manager.So, I ran it up under my profiler (jProfiler) and using jVisualVM, and both of them indicate the usual moderate heap and perm-gen usages of around 30M combined, even when fully active doing my load-test cycle.So I am mystified! And it not just requesting more memory from the Windows Virtual Memory pool - this is showing up as 200M ""Mem Usage"".CLARIFICATION: I want to be perfectly clear on this - observed over an 18 hour period with Java VisualVM the class heap and perm gen heap have been perfectly stable. The allocated volatile heap (eden and tenured) sits unmoved at 16MB (which it reaches in the first few minutes), and the use of this memory fluctuates in a perfect pattern of growing evenly from 8MB to 16MB, at which point GC kicks in an drops it back to 8MB. Over this 18 hour period, the system was under constant maximum load since I was running a stress test. This behavior is perfectly and consistently reproducible, seen over numerous runs. The only anomaly is that while this is going on the memory taken from Windows, observed via Task Manager, fluctuates all over the place from 64MB up to 900+MB.UPDATE 2008-12-18: I have run the program with -Xms16M -Xmx16M without any apparent adverse affect - performance is fine, total run time is about the same. But memory use in a short run still peaked at about 180M.Update 2009-01-21: It seems the answer may be in the number of threads - see my answer below.EDIT: And I mean millions of page faults literally - in the region of 30M+.EDIT: I have a 4G machine, so the 200M is not significant in that regard. <code> ",Java 6 Excessive Memory Usage

How is Java's notion of static different to that of C#'s?," I am reading Josh Bloch's book Effective Java and he suggests using a builder design pattern when building objects that have large amounts of members. From what I can see it isn't the vanilla design pattern but looks like his variation. I rather like the look of it and was trying to use it in a C# web application that I am writting. This is the code written in Java and works perfectly When I put this into what I think is the C# equivalent Then I get compiler warnings. Most of them ""cannot declare instance members in a static class"".So my question is firstly what have I missed? If I have missed something, can I do it in the manner Josh Bloch recommends but in C#, and lastly, and this one important too, is this thread-safe? <code>  public class Property { private String title; private String area; private int sleeps = 0; public static void main(String[] args) { Property newProperty = new Property.Builder(""Test Property"").Area(""Test Area"").Sleeps(7).build(); } private Property(Builder builder) { this.title = builder.title; this.area = builder.area; this.sleeps =builder.sleeps; } public static class Builder{ private String title; private String area; private int sleeps = 0; public Builder (String title){ this.title = title; } public Builder Area(String area){ this.area = area; return this; } public Builder Sleeps(int sleeps){ this.sleeps = sleeps; return this; } public Property build() { return new Property(this); } } } public class Property { private String title; private String area; private Property(Builder Builder) { title = Builder.title; area = Builder.area; } public static class Builder { // Required parameters private String title; private String area; // Optional parameters private int sleeps = 0; public Builder(String val) { this.title = val; } public Builder Area(String val) { this.area = val; return this; } public Builder Sleeps(int val) { this.sleeps = val; return this; } public Property build() { return new Property(this); } } }",How is Java's notion of static different from C#'s?

"Security with Java Scriting (JRuby, Jython, Groovy, BeanShell, etc)"," I'm looking to run some un-verified scripts (written in a yet-to-be-determined language, but needs to be Java-based, so JRuby, Groovy, Jython, BeanShell, etc are all candidates). I want these scripts to be able to do some things and restricted from doing other things.Normally, I'd just go use Java's SecurityManager and be done with it. That's pretty simple and lets me restrict file and network access, the ability to shutdown the JVM, etc. And that will work well for the high level stuff I want to block off.But there is some stuff I want to allow, but only via my custom API/library that I've providing. For example, I don't want to allow direct network access to open up a URLConnection to yahoo.com, but I am OK if it is done with MyURLConnection. That is - there is a set of methods/classes that I want to allow and then everything else I want to be off limits.I don't believe this type of security can be done with the standard Java security model, but perhaps it can. I don't have a specific requirement for performance or flexibility in the scripting language itself (the scripts will be simple procedural calls to my API with basic looping/branching).

Window events for JFrames that are hidden/unhidden?," Which kind of listener do I have to add to a JFrame to detect when it is being hidden or shown via setVisible?I tried using a WindowListener and the windowOpened and windowClosed methods, but they only work for the first time that a window is opened (windowOpened) or, respectively, when the window is closed using the dispose method (windowClosed).

The grid squares can only be full or not, there will be no different terrain.I'm hesitant to paste any code yet, as it's messy as I've learn a lot of new techniques to do with GUI in the past few months. My plan is to get to the milestone 1, making the patient go to the desk then the office and then leave. Once I have this, I will tidy up the code more.I've seen many implementations of A* and many different types. Can someone give me a starting point I can work with?

"Streaming Data through Spring JDBC, unkown length"," I currently have an application that inserts byte[] into our DB through the use of Spring JDBC [SqlLobValue]. The problem is, this is not a scalable way to take in data, as the server is buffering all the data in memory before writing to the database. I would like to stream the data from the HttpServletRequest Inputstream, but all the constructors I can find for any classes that take an Inputstream as an argument also require the content length as an argument. I do not, and will not, require the user to know the content length when POSTing data to my application. Is there a way around this limitation? I can find no documentation about what happens if I pass -1 for content length, but my guess is it will throw an Exception.

Why is Spring's ApplicationContex.getBean considered bad?," I asked a general Spring question: Auto-cast Spring Beans and had multiple people respond that calling Spring's ApplicationContext.getBean() should be avoided as much as possible. Why is that? How else should I gain access to the beans I configured Spring to create?I'm using Spring in a non-web application and had planned on accessing a shared ApplicationContext object as described by LiorH.AmendmentI accept the answer below, but here's an alternate take by Martin Fowler who discusses the merits of Dependency Injection vs. using a Service Locator (which is essentially the same as calling a wrapped ApplicationContext.getBean()).In part, Fowler states, ""With service locator the application class asks for it [the service] explicitly by a message to the locator. With injection there is no explicit request, the service appears in the application class - hence the inversion of control.Inversion of control is a common feature of frameworks, but it's something that comes at a price. It tends to be hard to understand and leads to problems when you are trying to debug. So on the whole I prefer to avoid it [Inversion of Control] unless I need it. This isn't to say it's a bad thing, just that I think it needs to justify itself over the more straightforward alternative."" <code> ",Why is Spring's ApplicationContext.getBean considered bad?
How can Java code detect if it is running in a container?," Thank you all for your help. A number of you posted (as I should have expected) answers indicating my whole approach was wrong, or that low-level code should never have to know whether or not it is running in a container. I would tend to agree. However, I'm dealing with a complex legacy application and do not have the option of doing a major refactoring for the current problem.Let me step back and ask the question the motivated my original question.I have a legacy application running under JBoss, and have made some modifications to lower-level code. I have created a unit test for my modification. In order to run the test, I need to connect to a database.The legacy code gets the data source this way:(jndiName is a defined string) My problem is that when I run this code under unit test, the Context has no data sources defined. My solution to this was to try to see if I'm running under the application server and, if not, create the test DataSource and return it. If I am running under the app server, then I use the code above.So, my real question is: What is the correct way to do this? Is there some approved way the unit test can set up the context to return the appropriate data source so that the code under test doesn't need to be aware of where it's running?For Context: MY ORIGINAL QUESTION:I have some Java code that needs to know whether or not it is running under JBoss. Is there a canonical way for code to tell whether it is running in a container?My first approach was developed through experimention and consists of getting the initial context and testing that it can look up certain values. Now, this seems to work, but it feels like a hack. What is the ""correct"" way to do this? Ideally, I'd like a way that would work with a variety of application servers, not just JBoss. <code>  Context ctx = new InitialContext();DataSource dataSource = (DataSource) ctx.lookup(jndiName); private boolean isRunningUnderJBoss(Context ctx) { boolean runningUnderJBoss = false; try { // The following invokes a naming exception when not running under // JBoss. ctx.getNameInNamespace(); // The URL packages must contain the string ""jboss"". String urlPackages = (String) ctx.lookup(""java.naming.factory.url.pkgs""); if ((urlPackages != null) && (urlPackages.toUpperCase().contains(""JBOSS""))) { runningUnderJBoss = true; } } catch (Exception e) { // If we get there, we are not under JBoss runningUnderJBoss = false; } return runningUnderJBoss; }Context ctx = new InitialContext();if (isRunningUnderJboss(ctx){.........",How should unit tests set up data sources when not running in an application server?

What I wonder about is, is it necessary to explicitly make sure the nested streams are closed, or is it enough to just make sure to close the outer stream (oos)?One thing I notice, at least dealing with this specific example, is that the inner streams only seem to throw FileNotFoundExceptions. Which would seem to imply that there's not technically a need to worry about closing them if they fail.Here's what a colleague wrote:Technically, if it were implemented right, closing the outermoststream (oos) should be enough.

Is log4j isDebugEnabled checking improves perfromance ?," I am using Log4J in my application for logging. Previously I was using debug call like:Option 1: but some links suggest that it is better to check isDebugEnabled() first, like: Option 2: So my question is ""Does option 2 improve performance any way?"".Because in any case Log4J framework have same check for debugEnabled. For option 2 it might be beneficial if we are using multiple debug statement in single method or class, where the framework does not need to call isDebugEnabled() method multiple times (on each call); in this case it calls isDebugEnabled() method only once, and if Log4J is configured to debug level then actually it calls isDebugEnabled() method twice:In case of assigning value to debugEnabled variable, andActually called by logger.debug() method.I don't think that if we write multiple logger.debug() statement in method or class and calling debug() method according to option 1 then it is overhead for Log4J framework in comparison with option 2. Since isDebugEnabled() is a very small method (in terms of code), it might be good candidate for inlining. <code>  logger.debug(""some debug text""); boolean debugEnabled = logger.isDebugEnabled();if (debugEnabled) { logger.debug(""some debug text"");}","In log4j, does checking isDebugEnabled before logging improve performance?"

The reason we've decided not to use EJB3 is because - and please correct me if I am wrong - if we use EJB3 we can only run it on a full blown java application server like jboss and if we don't use EJB3 we can still run it on a lightweight server like tomcat.

If you have any documentation from MS or otherwise that would be awesome although not the crux of the question.Edit: I discovered that the Windows 7 Play-to functionality is based on DLNA and any device supporting DLNA (I think) can be used as a destination for the Play-To context menu. However, I'm having a really difficult time finding any sort of documentation on DLNA. I'm wondering if you need to be a member of the DNLA to actually get access to the spec? Alternatively, I know DLNA is built on UPnP, it wouldn't exactly do what I want, but it would be a step in the right direction, so, to revise my question does anybody know of any open-source C/C++ or Java (preferable) libraries that would help me implement UPnP or DLNA?Thanks!Chris <code> ",Implementing DLNA/UPnP (Win7 Play To) on a mobile device

When I publish the web project as a war to JBoss only project B is packaged into the jar (no spring jars) I know I can do it with ant, I even have such build.xml to build the whole app, but I thought eclipse can also perform the packaging task for me.I added the Java project to the Java EE module dependencies in the web project.Should I use the export option in the Java project build path properties? should I add the dependencies of the Java project to the web project as well?What am I doing wrong?Edit: I am using Eclipse 3.5.1 <code> ",Eclipse Web Project Dependencies

Order of items in a HashMap differ when the same program is run in JVM5 vs JVM6?," I have an application which displays a collection of objects in rows, one object = one row. The objects are stored in a HashMap. The order of the rows does not affect the functionality of the application (that is why a HashMap was used instead of a sortable collection).However I have noticed that the same application runs differently when run using two different versions of the Java Virtual Machine. The application is compiled using JDK 5, and can be run using either Java 5 or Java 6 runtimes, without any functional difference.The object in question overrides java.lang.Object#hashCode() and obviously care has been taken to follow the contract specified in the Java API. This is evidenced by the fact that they always appear in the same order in every run of the application (in the same Java runtime).For curiosity's sake, why does the choice of Java runtime affect the order? <code> ",Order of items in a HashMap differ when the same program is run in JVM5 vs JVM6

JAVA inverse matrix calculation," I'm trying to calculate the inverse matrix in Java.

However, when the matrix is bigger than 12x12 the time it needs to complete the calculation increases exponentially.The matrix I need to invert is 19x19, and it takes too much time. The method that more time consumes is the method used for the calculation of the determinant.

Why do Exception.fillInStackTrace return Throwable?," I think Exception.fillInStackTrace should return Exception or derived Exception objects. Considering the two functions below, The exception handler could not catch the new Throwable() in the first function f().The exception handler could catch the e.fillInstackTrace() in the second function g().But the second function g() would still need to throws Throwable. This is really strange, since we could catch e.fillInstackTrace().So my question is why doesn't Exception.fillInStackTrace return Exception or Exception-derived instead of developing such a strange syntax?EDIT:To clarify my question: What I mean by ""strange syntax"" areSince Exception.fillInStackTrace() return Throwable reference,the exception handler which recieve Exception reference should not be able to catch the exception.Because java does not allow implict downcast,it should be something like return (Exception)e.fillInstackTrace().Since it is designed that the exception handler recieving Exception reference could handle the Throwable exception,there is no need to mark the method g() throws Throwable exception.But java compiler would enforce us to do so.thanks. <code>  public static void f() throws Throwable { try { throw new Throwable(); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(""catch exception e""); e.printStackTrace(); } }public static void g() throws Throwable { try { try { throw new Exception(""exception""); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(""inner exception handler""); throw e.fillInStackTrace(); } } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(""outer exception handler""); e.printStackTrace(); }}",Why does Exception.fillInStackTrace return Throwable?

Problems editing a JCheckBox node in a JTree," I am attempting to modify the standard Swing JTree to intermingle nodes with and without checkboxes. This is an example:When I attempt to check/uncheck one of the checkboxes (the 'User 01' node in this example), the tree loses nodes:I my code is an adaptation of this example: http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5321084&start=13.Instead of embedding a JCheckBox in a DefaultMutableTreeNode like this: I thought it made more sense to create a model node that derived from the DefaultMutableTreeNode, which I call JTreeNode. This class automatically sets the DefaultMutableTreeNode's UserObject to a JCheckBox. The class' ShowCheckBox property is used by the TreeCellRenderer to determine if the JCheckBox or DefaultTreeCellRenderer is used. The JTreeNode is used like this: I believe the problem is with the class that implements the TreeCellEditor, specifically in the getCellEditorValue() or getTreeCellEditorComponent() methods. I suspect the issue has something to with the getCellEditorValue() returning a derivative of the DefaultMutableTreeNode, rather than a simpler model instance. Here is the TreeCellRender's getTreeCellRendererComponent() method: Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. <code>  new DefaultMutableTreeNode(new CheckBoxNode(""Accessibility"", true)); JTreeNode user01 = new JTreeNode(""User 01""); user01.setShowCheckBox(true); user01.setSelected(true); public Object getCellEditorValue() { JCheckBox checkBox = renderer.getCheckBoxRenderer(); JTreeNode node = new JTreeNode(checkBox.getText()); node.setShowCheckBox(true); node.setSelected(checkBox.isSelected()); return node;}public Component getTreeCellEditorComponent(JTree tree, Object value, boolean isSelected, boolean expanded, boolean leaf, int row) { Component editor = renderer.getTreeCellRendererComponent(tree, value, true, expanded, leaf, row, true); // editor always selected / focused ItemListener itemListener = new ItemListener() { public void itemStateChanged(ItemEvent itemEvent) { if (stopCellEditing()) { fireEditingStopped(); } } }; if (editor instanceof JCheckBox) { ((JCheckBox) editor).addItemListener(itemListener); } return editor;} public Component getTreeCellRendererComponent(JTree tree, Object value, boolean selected, boolean expanded, boolean leaf, int row, boolean hasFocus) { Component component; //if object being passed for rendering is a JTreeNode that should show a JCheckBox, attempt to render it so if (((JTreeNode) value).getShowCheckBox()) { String stringValue = tree.convertValueToText(value, selected, expanded, leaf, row, false); //set default JCheckBox rendering checkBoxRenderer.setText(stringValue); checkBoxRenderer.setSelected(false); //not checked checkBoxRenderer.setEnabled(tree.isEnabled()); if (selected) { //removed colorization //checkBoxRenderer.setForeground(selectionForeground); //checkBoxRenderer.setBackground(selectionBackground); } else { checkBoxRenderer.setForeground(textForeground); checkBoxRenderer.setBackground(textBackground); } //DefaultMutableTreeNode if ((value != null) && (value instanceof JTreeNode)) { //userObject should be a JTreeNode instance //DefaultMutableTreeNode //Object userObject = ((JTreeNode) value).getUserObject(); //if it is //if (userObject instanceof JTreeNode) { //cast as a JTreeNode //JTreeNode node = (JTreeNode) userObject; JTreeNode node = (JTreeNode) value; //set JCheckBox settings to match JTreeNode's settings checkBoxRenderer.setText(node.getText()); checkBoxRenderer.setSelected(node.isSelected()); //} } component = checkBoxRenderer; } //if not, render the default else { component = defaultRenderer.getTreeCellRendererComponent(tree, value, selected, expanded, leaf, row, hasFocus); } return component;}",JTree rendering with JCheckBox nodes

How to use coldfusion.sql.QueryTable to convert from Java resultset to ColdFusion query in Railo?," The following works fine in CFMX 7 and CF8, and I'd assume CF9 as well: This creates a statement using a JDBC driver, executes a query against it, putting it into a java resultset, and then coldfusion.sql.QueryTable is instantiated, passed the Java resulset object, and then queryTable.FirstTable() is called, which returns an actual coldfusion resultset (for cfloop and the like).The problem comes with a difference in Railo's implementation.

Java: Synchronizing on primatives?," In our system, we have a method that will do some work when it's called with a certain ID: Now, this work can be done concurrently for different IDs, but if the method is called with the same ID by 2 threads, one thread should block until it's finished.The simplest solution would be to have a Map that maps from the Long ID to some arbitrary object that we can lock on. One problem I foresee with this is that we can have tons of IDs in the system and this map will keep growing every day.Ideally, I think we need a system where we each thread will fetch a lock object, lock when possible, do the work, then signal that we're done with the lock. If it's clear that nobody else is using this particular lock, then safely remove it from the lock map to prevent the memory leak.I imagine this must be a pretty common scenario so I'm hoping there is an existing solution out there.

Detecting Asymptotes in a Graph," I am creating a graphing calculator in Java as a project for my programming class. There are two main components to this calculator: the graph itself, which draws the line(s), and the equation evaluator, which takes in an equation as a String and... well, evaluates it.To create the line, I create a Path2D.Double instance, and loop through the points on the line. To do this, I calculate as many points as the graph is wide (e.g. if the graph itself is 500px wide, I calculate 500 points), and then scale it to the window of the graph.Now, this works perfectly for most any line. However, it does not when dealing with singularities.If, when calculating points, the graph encounters a domain error (such as 1/0), the graph closes the shape in the Path2D.Double instance and starts a new line, so that the line looks mathematically correct. Example:(source: imagesocket.com) However, because of the way it scales, sometimes it is rendered correctly, sometimes it isn't. When it isn't, the actual asymptotic line is shown, because within those 500 points, it skipped over x = 2.0 in the equation 1 / (x-2), and only did x = 1.98 and x = 2.04, which are perfectly valid in that equation. Example:(source: imagesocket.com) In that case, I increased the window on the left and right one unit each.My question is: Is there a way to deal with singularities using this method of scaling so that the resulting line looks mathematically correct?I myself have thought of implementing a binary search-esque method, where, if it finds that it calculates one point, and then the next point is wildly far away from the last point, it searches in between those points for a domain error.

comparator with null values.," We have some code which sorts a list of addresses based on the distance between their coordinates. this is done through collections.sort with a custom comparator.However from time to time an address without coordinates is in the list causing a NullPointerException. My initial idea to fix this was to have the comparator return 0 as distance for addresses where at least one of the coordinates is null. I fear this might lead to corruption of the order the 'valid' elements in the list.so is returning a '0' values for null data in a comparator ok, or is there a cleaner way to resolve this? <code> ",comparator with null values

Why is it a bad practice to call System.gc?," After answering a question about how to force-free objects in Java (the guy was clearing a 1.5GB HashMap) with System.gc(), I was told it's bad practice to call System.gc() manually, but the comments were not entirely convincing. In addition, no one seemed to dare to upvote, nor downvote my answer.I was told there that it's bad practice, but then I was also told that garbage collector runs don't systematically stop the world anymore, and that it could also effectively be used by the JVM only as a hint, so I'm kind of at loss.I do understand that the JVM usually knows better than you when it needs to reclaim memory. I also understand that worrying about a few kilobytes of data is silly. I also understand that even megabytes of data isn't what it was a few years back. But still, 1.5 gigabytes? And you know there's like 1.5 GB of data hanging around in memory; it's not like it's a shot in the dark. Is System.gc() systematically bad, or is there some point at which it becomes okay?So the question is actually double:Why is or isn't it bad practice to call System.gc()? Is it really merely a hint to the JVM under certain implementations, or is it always a full collection cycle? Are there really garbage collector implementations that can do their work without stopping the world? Please shed some light over the various assertions people have made in the comments to my answer.Where's the threshold? Is it never a good idea to call System.gc(), or are there times when it's acceptable? If so, what are those times? <code> ",Why is it bad practice to call System.gc()?

"In java, is there any disadvantage to static methods on a class?"," Lets assume that a rule (or rule of thumb, anyway), has been imposed in my coding environment that any method on a class that doesn't use, modify, or otherwise need any instance variables to do its work, be made static. Is there any inherent compile time, runtime, or any other disadvantage to doing this?(edited for further clarifications)I know the question was somewhat open ended and vague so I apologize for that. My intent in asking was in the context of mostly ""helper"" methods. Utility classes (with private CTORs so they can't be instantiated) as holders for static methods we already do. My question here was more in line of these little methods that HELP OUT the main class API.I might have 4 or 5 main API/instance methods on a class that do the real work, but in the course of doing so they share some common functionality that might only be working on the input parameters to the API method, and not internal state. THESE are the code sections I typically pull out into their own helper methods, and if they don't need to access the class' state, make them static.My question was thus, is this inherently a bad idea, and if so, why?

JUnit confusion: use 'extend Testcase' or '@Test' ?," I've found the proper use (or at least the documentation) of JUnit very confusing.This question serves both as a future reference and as a real question.If I've understood correctly, there are two main approaches to create and run a JUnit test:Approach A (JUnit 3-style): create a class that extends TestCase, and start test methods with the word test. When running the class as a JUnit Test (in Eclipse), all methods starting with the word test are automatically run. Approach B (JUnit 4-style): create a 'normal' class and prepend a @Test annotation to the method. Note that you do NOT have to start the method with the word test. Mixing the two seems not to be a good idea, see e.g. this stackoverflow question: Now, my questions(s):What is the preferred approach, or when would you use one instead of the other?Approach B allows for testing for exceptions by extending the @Test annotation like in @Test(expected = ArithmeticException.class). But how do you test for exceptions when using approach A?When using approach A, you can group a number of test classes in a test suite like this:TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(""All tests"");suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestA.class);suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestAbis.class);But this can't be used with approach B (since each testclass should subclass TestCase). What is the proper way to group tests for approach B?Edit: I've added the JUnit versions to both approaches <code>  import junit.framework.TestCase;public class DummyTestA extends TestCase { public void testSum() { int a = 5; int b = 10; int result = a + b; assertEquals(15, result); }} import org.junit.*;import static org.junit.Assert.*;public class DummyTestB { @Test public void Sum() { int a = 5; int b = 10; int result = a + b; assertEquals(15, result); }}",JUnit confusion: use 'extends TestCase' or '@Test'?
[Java] - Problem having my main thread sleeping, I have the main thread of execution which spawns new threads. In the main thread of execution in main() I am calling Thread.sleep().

Why can't your switch statement data type be long Java?," Here's an excerpt from Sun's Java tutorials: A switch works with the byte, short, char, and int primitive data types. It also works with enumerated types (discussed in Classes and Inheritance) and a few special classes that ""wrap"" certain primitive types: Character, Byte, Short, and Integer (discussed in Simple Data Objects).There must be a good reason why the long primitive data type is not allowed. Anyone know what it is? <code> ","Why can't your switch statement data type be long, Java?"

Java: how to do fast copy of a BufferedImage's pixels? (include unit test)," I want to do a copy (of a rectangle area) of the ARGB values from a source BufferedImage into a destination BufferedImage. No compositing should be done: if I copy a pixel with an ARGB value of 0x8000BE50 (alpha value at 128), then the destination pixel must be exactly 0x8000BE50, totally overriding the destination pixel.I've got a very precise question and I made a unit test to show what I need. The unit test is fully functional and self-contained and is passing fine and is doing precisely what I want.However, I want a faster and more memory efficient method to replace copySrcIntoDstAt(...).That's the whole point of my question: I'm not after how to ""fill"" the image in a faster way (what I did is just an example to have a unit test). All I want is to know what would be a fast and memory efficient way to do it (ie fast and not creating needless objects).The proof-of-concept implementation I've made is obviously very memory efficient, but it is slow (doing one getRGB and one setRGB for every pixel).Schematically, I've got this: (where A indicates corresponding pixels from the destination image before the copy) And I want to have this: where 'B' represents the pixels from the src image.Note that I'm looking for an exact replacement of the copySrcIntoDstAt(...) method, not for an API link/quote. <code>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA import org.junit.Test;import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;import static org.junit.Assert.*;public class TestCopy { private static final int COL1 = 0x8000BE50; // alpha at 128 private static final int COL2 = 0x1732FE87; // alpha at 23 @Test public void testPixelsCopy() { final BufferedImage src = new BufferedImage( 5, 5, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB ); final BufferedImage dst = new BufferedImage( 20, 20, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB ); convenienceFill( src, COL1 ); convenienceFill( dst, COL2 ); copySrcIntoDstAt( src, dst, 3, 4 ); for (int x = 0; x < dst.getWidth(); x++) { for (int y = 0; y < dst.getHeight(); y++) { if ( x >= 3 && x <= 7 && y >= 4 && y <= 8 ) { assertEquals( COL1, dst.getRGB(x,y) ); } else { assertEquals( COL2, dst.getRGB(x,y) ); } } } } // clipping is unnecessary private static void copySrcIntoDstAt( final BufferedImage src, final BufferedImage dst, final int dx, final int dy ) { // TODO: replace this by a much more efficient method for (int x = 0; x < src.getWidth(); x++) { for (int y = 0; y < src.getHeight(); y++) { dst.setRGB( dx + x, dy + y, src.getRGB(x,y) ); } } } // This method is just a convenience method, there's // no point in optimizing this method, this is not what // this question is about private static void convenienceFill( final BufferedImage bi, final int color ) { for (int x = 0; x < bi.getWidth(); x++) { for (int y = 0; y < bi.getHeight(); y++) { bi.setRGB( x, y, color ); } } }}",Java: how to do fast copy of a BufferedImage's pixels?

Do the 'up to date' guarantees provided by final field in Java's memory model extend to indirect references?," The Java language spec defines semantics of final fields in section 17.5: The usage model for final fields is a simple one. Set the final fields for an object in that object's constructor. Do not write a reference to the object being constructed in a place where another thread can see it before the object's constructor is finished. If this is followed, then when the object is seen by another thread, that thread will always see the correctly constructed version of that object's final fields. It will also see versions of any object or array referenced by those final fields that are at least as up-to-date as the final fields are.My question is - does the 'up-to-date' guarantee extend to the contents of nested arrays, and nested objects?In a nutshell: If one thread assigns a mutable object graph to a final field in an object, and the object graph is never updated, can all threads safely read that object graph via the final field? An example scenario:Thread A constructs a HashMap of ArrayLists, then assigns the HashMap to final field 'myFinal' in an instance of class 'MyClass'Thread B sees a (non-synchronized) reference to the MyClass instance and reads 'myFinal', and accesses and reads the contents of one of the ArrayListsIn this scenario, are the members of the ArrayList as seen by Thread B guaranteed to be at least as up to date as they were when MyClass's constructor completed?I'm looking for clarification of the semantics of the Java Memory Model and language spec, rather than alternative solutions like synchronization. My dream answer would be a yes or no, with a reference to the relevant text.Updates: I'm interested in the semantics of Java 1.5 and above, i.e. with the updated Java Memory Model introduced via JSR 133. The 'up-to-date' guarantee on final fields was introduced in this update.  <code> ",Do the up to date guarantees for values of Java's final fields extend to indirect references?

Backreferences syntax in replacement strings (why dollar sign?)," In Java, and it seems in a few other languages, backreferences in the pattern are preceded by a backslash (e.g. \1, \2, \3, etc), but in a replacement string they preceded by a dollar sign (e.g. $1, $2, $3, and also $0).Here's a snippet to illustrate: Questions:Is the use of $ for backreferences in replacement strings unique to Java?

How can I force a Constructor to be defined in all subclass of my abstract class.," I have an abstract class A that define abstract methods. This means that, for a class to be instanciable, all the abstract method have to be implemented.I'd like all my subclasses to implement a constructor with 2 ints as parameters. Declaring a constructor defeats my purpose, as I want the constructor defined in subclasses and I don't know anything about the implementation. Moreover I cannot declare a constructor as being abstract;Is there a way to do this ?Example of what I want:Lets say that I am defining the API of a Matrix class. In my problem, Matrix cannot change their dimensions.For a Matrix to be created, I need to provide its size.Hence, I want all my implementors to provide the constructor with the size as a parameter. This constructor is motivated by the problem, not by an implementation concern. The implementation can do whatever it wants with these, provided that all the semantic of the methods are kept.Let's say I want to provide a basic implementation of the invert() method in my abstract class. This method will create a new matrix with this inverted dimensions. More specifically, as it is defined in the abstract class, it will create a new instance of the same class as this, using a constructor that takes two ints. As it does not know the instance it will use reflection (getDefinedConstructor) and I want a way to waranty that I'll get it and that it will be meaningfull for the implementation. <code> ",How can I force a Constructor to be defined in all subclass of my abstract class

Running a standalone Hadoop on multiple CPU cores.," My team built a Java application using the Hadoop libraries to transform a bunch of input files into useful output.Given the current load a single multicore server will do fine for the coming year or so. We do not (yet) have the need to go for a multiserver Hadoop cluster, yet we chose to start this project ""being prepared"".When I run this app on the command-line (or in eclipse or netbeans) I have not yet been able to convince it to use more that one map and/or reduce thread at a time.Given the fact that the tool is very CPU intensive this ""single threadedness"" is my current bottleneck.When running it in the netbeans profiler I do see that the app starts several threads for various purposes, but only a single map/reduce is running at the same moment.The input data consists of several input files so Hadoop should at least be able to run 1 thread per input file at the same time for the map phase.What do I do to at least have 2 or even 4 active threads running (which should be possible for most of the processing time of this application)?I'm expecting this to be something very silly that I've overlooked.I just found this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-1367 This implements the feature I was looking for in Hadoop 0.21It introduces the flag mapreduce.local.map.tasks.maximum to control it.For now I've also found the solution described here in this question.  <code> ",Running a standalone Hadoop application on multiple CPU cores.

However, I haven't spent much time thinking about how to make pages stateless.If I understand correctly, making a stateless page is achieved by making the page bookmarkable and making sure that no stateful components are added to the page.For the website I am making I want to avoid ""Page expired"" messages, let users be logged in via cookies, make a whole lot of the content available without needing to login/create a session, and I want functionality such as pagination to be stateless and bookmarkable. This is no problem with e.g. PHP, but it seems to me that a whole lot of the useful Wicket components are stateful. Am I in for a whole lot of work, such as creating my own set of components that are stateless, or is it no big deal?I hope someone can help me out by pointing me in the right direction.EDIT: Lets say I wanted to make a blog. Browsing posts, categories and so on should be possible without having to worry that the page will have become expired if a user decides to read an article for 2 hours and then tries to navigate further via e.g. pagination. I want to allow users to stay logged in for a month at a time, but I do not exactly want to store their session for a month either.I'd greatly appreciate any help on how I can accomplish what I just described, with Wicket.  <code> ",Is it difficult to make a mainly stateless web application with Wicket?

logging framework disconnects," I'm building a small Java app and hoping to use logback for logging.My app has a dependency on an older project that does its logging via ...so my plan was to use ...to redirect the JCL logging to ...and ultimately to so my app can log through logback via its slf4j API while the old library code can log into the same location via the redirection.Alas, this results in I've tried higher and lower verision numbers on some of these jars and also digging through API documentation and such... but I'm unable to find and solve the problem. Help, please?Although logback is considered the ""strategic"" logging framework, I have some leeway in which logging mechanism I ultimately use.

Why Android uses Java?," OK, this should really be asked to someone from Google, but I just want other opinions.Even though Android supports Native code applications, the main development tool is still Java. But why? I mean, isn't it too slow to interpret code on a mobile device? When introducing Froyo, Google said that new JIT compiler can achieve 2-5 times faster applications. This means, that using Java over native code is 2-x times slower.Yes, I know that using managed code applications is safer in terms of system stability, since virtual machines have better control over program execution, but still, this performance drop is huge, and I don't see any point why to use it. <code> ",Why does Android use Java?

Multi-user  Datasources - Spring + Hibernate," I'm writing a web app that supports multiple users. Each user has their own database - using H2. all database schemas are the same.I wish to use Spring + Hibernate for this application.So I'm stuck at how to associate a user's database with that user - maybe associated it in the HTTPSession, and extend spring's AbstractRoutingDataSource? but wouldn't this effect Hibernate's cache? Another way is to have a SessionFactory with each datasource, even though every datasource's schema is the same... so I see that as a waste.Anyways selecting the datasource needs to be dynamic - they can't be pre-configured in context files, as each new user will have its own database created. Is there any existing frameworks/solutions?I don't know too much about Hibernate Shards, maybe that works? <code> ",Multi-user Datasources - Spring + Hibernate

ProcessBuilder vs Runtine.exec()," I'm trying to create a frontend app in Java to handle batch SVG conversions using Inkscape's command line feature. I'm taking and updating the code from https://sourceforge.net/projects/conversionsvg/. The way the original developer handled calling Inkscape by Runtime.getRuntime().exec(String). The issue I'm running into is some inconsistencies between using methodA and methodB. I created a simple java test project to demonstrate the different actions being performed.CallerTest.java RuntimeExecCaller.java ProcessBuilderCaller.java ResultBoth methodA(String) calls work, but when methodB(String[]) is called Inkscape is being started and the arguments are being passed incorrectly. After methodB(String[]) executes I get an Inkscape error dialog for each sayingFailed to load the requested file -f C:/test.svg -D -w 100 -h 100 -e C:\RuntimeExec-methodB.pngFailed to load the requested file -f C:/test.svg -D -w 100 -h 100 -e C:\ProcessBuilder-methodB.pngand when I click Close on the dialog, Inkscape pops up with a new blank document. So, I guess I have a few questions:What is the difference between Runtime.getRuntime().exec(String) and Runtime.getRuntime().exec(String[])?JavaDoc says that Runtime.exec(String) calls Runtime.exec(command, null) (which is Runtime.exec(String cmd, String[] envp)) which in turn calls Runtime.exec(cmdarray, envp) (which is Runtime.exec(String[] cmdarray, String[] envp)). So, if Runtime.getRuntime().exec(String) is calling Runtime.exec(String[]) anyways, why am I getting different results when using different methods?Is something happening behind the scenes where Java sets up the environment differently depending on which method is called? <code>  package conversion;import java.io.IOException;public class CallerTest { static String pathToInkscape = ""\""C:\\Program Files\\Inkscape\\inkscape.exe\""""; public static void main(String[] args) { ProcessBuilderCaller processBuilder = new ProcessBuilderCaller(); RuntimeExecCaller runtimeExec = new RuntimeExecCaller(); // methodA() uses one long command line string try { String oneLongString_ProcessBuilder = pathToInkscape + "" -f \""C:\\test.svg\"" -D -w 100 -h 100 -e \""C:\\ProcessBuilder-methodB.png\""""; String oneLongString_RuntimeExec = pathToInkscape + "" -f \""C:\\test.svg\"" -D -w 100 -h 100 -e \""C:\\RuntimeExec-methodA.png\""""; // processBuilder.methodA(oneLongString_ProcessBuilder); runtimeExec.methodA(oneLongString_RuntimeExec); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } // methodB() uses an array containing the command and the options to pass to the command try { String[] commandAndOptions_ProcessBuilder = {pathToInkscape, "" -f \""C:/test.svg\"" -D -w 100 -h 100 -e \""C:\\ProcessBuilder-methodB.png\""""}; String[] commandAndOptions_RuntimeExec = {pathToInkscape, "" -f \""C:/test.svg\"" -D -w 100 -h 100 -e \""C:\\RuntimeExec-methodB.png\""""}; processBuilder.methodB(commandAndOptions_ProcessBuilder);// runtimeExec.methodB(commandAndOptions_RuntimeExec); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } }} package conversion;import java.io.IOException;public class RuntimeExecCaller { Process process; // use one string public void methodA(String oneLongString) throws IOException { process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(oneLongString); } // use the array public void methodB(String[] commandAndOptions) throws IOException { process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(commandAndOptions); }} package conversion;import java.io.IOException;public class ProcessBuilderCaller { Process process; // use one string public void methodA(String oneLongString) throws IOException { process = new ProcessBuilder(oneLongString).start(); } // use the array public void methodB(String[] commandAndOptions) throws IOException { process = new ProcessBuilder(commandAndOptions).start(); }}",ProcessBuilder vs Runtime.exec()

I'm not sure what I'mm doing wrong but I think it also happens when I use other libraries in Eclipse.Source: The error message: <code>  import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;public class Main { static BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor(); public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(""Hello World""); textEncryptor.setPassword(""123""); System.out.println(textEncryptor.encrypt(""Hello World"")); }} java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/lang/exception/NestableRuntimeException at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCond(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source) at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source) at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source) at java.net.URLClassLoader.access$000(Unknown Source) at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor.<init>(BasicTextEncryptor.java:67) at eMain.<clinit>(eMain.java:4)Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.commons.lang.exception.NestableRuntimeException at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) ... 14 more",String encryption with Jasypt library
final and static in java, I have read this sentence in a book but I didn't understand it: A field that is both static and final has only one piece of storage that cannot be changed.Can anyone explain it for me? <code> ,final and static in Java
this vs super keywords, What is the difference between the keywords this and super?Both are used to access constructors of class right? Can any of you explain? <code> ,"Difference between ""this"" and""super"" keywords in Java"

How would you represent date of birthday in your java model?," And wait, don't rush to answer ""java.util.Date"", consider the following scenario.Person object having 2 fields: ""birthday"" and ""nextMeeting"" both java.util.Date.Now birthday stored in database as date type column (no time) for eg. 01-10-1979, and nextMeeting as datetime type for ex. 01-10-2010 20:00:00.You pull it from db, ""birthday"" will be auto set to midnight by JDBC.Now you need to send this object to other JVM using lets say RMI or whatever technology.On the other end JVM has timezone -1h from originating JVM. This is where problem starts.nextMeeting become 01-10-2010 19:00:00 which is absolutely FINE and CORRECT from user perspective etc...BUT birthday become 30-09-1979 23:00:00 which will be represented to user as 30th of September, which is really not what we want, cause obviously birthday is something static and NOT dependent on timezones. So column type in db chosen correctly (date). This type of column usually represented as java.util.Date. But in our case it is wrong java type to use.So how would you represent a birthday? Consider that you need to manipulate this object on a UI like in a datepicker component etc... <code> ",How would you represent date of birth in your java model?
Seam Faces @ViewScoped beans cause a deploy-time error.," I'm running a Java EE 6 application out of an EAR (bundling an EJB-JAR and a WAR) on GlassFish 3.0.1, using ICEfaces 2.0 Beta 1 and a Seam Faces 3.0.0 Alpha 3 Snapshot.When I deploy the EAR, I get an error. This error doesn't happen when I remove Seam Faces. Here's the error from my GlassFish log (I redacted the first bit, where it just lists out my session beans and says that they have been transformed. I cut off the last few exceptions, because of StackOverflow's 30000-character limit.): What gives? I've searched the web for this exception, and it looks like it happens when CDI is enabled on both an EJB-JAR and a WAR packaged inside a single EAR, but only my WAR has CDI enabled (only it has a beans.xml). I tried moving the dependency up to the EAR, but I just get a different exception then.Thank you! :) <code>  INFO: Loading application com.example.science_ScienceEar_ear_2.0.3-SNAPSHOT#ScheduleWeb-2.0.3-SNAPSHOT.war at /scheduleINFO: Initializing Mojarra 2.0.2 (FCS b10) for context '/science'WARNING: JSF1059: WARNING!

Seam Faces beans cause a deploy-time error.," I'm running a Java EE 6 application out of an EAR (bundling an EJB-JAR and a WAR) on GlassFish 3.0.1, using ICEfaces 2.0 Beta 1 and a Seam Faces 3.0.0 Alpha 3 Snapshot.When I deploy the EAR, I get an error. This error doesn't happen when I remove Seam Faces. Here's the error from my GlassFish log (I redacted the first bit, where it just lists out my session beans and says that they have been transformed. I cut off the last few exceptions, because of StackOverflow's 30000-character limit.): What gives? I've searched the web for this exception, and it looks like it happens when CDI is enabled on both an EJB-JAR and a WAR packaged inside a single EAR, but only my WAR has CDI enabled (only it has a beans.xml). I tried moving the dependency up to the EAR, but I just get a different exception then.Thank you! :) <code>  INFO: Loading application com.example.science_ScienceEar_ear_2.0.3-SNAPSHOT#ScheduleWeb-2.0.3-SNAPSHOT.war at /scheduleINFO: Initializing Mojarra 2.0.2 (FCS b10) for context '/science'WARNING: JSF1059: WARNING!

How mature is Ebean or Siena," In the last time I heard a lot of complaining about Hibernate. And indeed I have some painful experiences with Hibernate too. So I read about Ebean and Siena.Both have interesting approaches. Unfortunately, database access layers are very easy to write, but if your project grows and you have to handle great database-tables, you know if they are good or not. So it's really difficult to evaluate such a tool. Hibernate is well known and you could be sure that you can solve your problem with it. Sometime you need to learn a lot, but you can solve it.How is it with Ebean? Are there any real world applications? Which databases are supported? Is it reliable?After searching a little bit more I see that there are a lot more ORM-frameworks, so is there at least one reliable one? <code> ",How mature is Ebean or Siena?

JDBC  Oracle - Fetch explain plan for query," Im wondering how I can fetch the explain plan using Java. Reason I need this is because we have a framework where special users can craft reports.

Example code which gives me illegal column exception: <code>  ResultSet rs = null; try { oracle = ConnectionManager.getConnection(ConnectionManager.Test); pstmt = oracle.prepareStatement(""begin execute immediate 'explain plan for SELECT 1 from Dual'; end;""); rs = pstmt.executeQuery(); while (rs.next()) { System.out.println(rs.getString(1)); }",JDBC Oracle - Fetch explain plan for query

Android - embedding ListView inside Gallery," The goal is to implement a Gallery whose adapter returns ListViews (in other words, vertically scrolling ListViews embedded in a horizontally scrolling Gallery). It sort of works after a bit of work, but when attempting to scroll horizontally, the ListView looks very jittery, like there is some stickiness to it being centered. I have not observed this kind of behavior with any other type of View embedded in a Gallery.Here is what I have tried:Initially, I found that the ListView squashed touch events, so the gesture listener on the Gallery never gets fired.So in the onCreate() method of the Activity, I created a GestureDetector:galleryGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, gallery);Then, inside the getView() method of the Gallery adapter, after the ListView has been inflated and configured, I have some code like this: In this case I have even gone to the extreme step of returning true from the OnTouchListener to ensure that the onTouchEvent() method of the listView is never actually called. The same jittery behavior occurs. As a result, I think I can rule out competing onTouchEvent() implementations between the two views.I tried abusing the TouchDelegate concept as well by extending the Gallery's touch rectangle to include the ListView and then forcing the ListView to delegate to it, but this was a futile effort as well.I would throw up my hands and say it isn't possible currently, but the Social Networking app that packs with the DroidX somehow accomplishes it! <code>  listView.setOnTouchListener(new OnTouchListener() { public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) { galleryGestureDetector.onTouchEvent(event); return true; }});",Embedding ListView inside Gallery

By default the application display first selectOneMenu data at the top and corresponding Filter information at the bottom. If the user selects different selectOneMenu data, corresponding Filter information should be loaded on bottom content part. Filter component has CommandButton and user fills Filter information. On click of the button, and the Filter is approved, the application should load another component - Report.xhtml in place of Filter component. That is Filter component should be replaced by Report on bottom content part. Click on selectOneMenu item should repeat the process. That is display Filter screen and so on.Problem area1.

"@SuppressWarnings(""serial"") "," I have a question because I'm getting a little confused (or maybe I'm not noticing something obvious). Let's say that I've got some source code that contains a lot of classes which contain a great number of static fields defined like this one: As we all know, static fields are not going to be serialized.However, Java (and Eclipse) complains that ""The serializable class does not declare a static final serialVersionUID field of type long"". Why can't they notice that static is not going to be serialized?And the next question: would it be a right solution to this issue to use @SuppressWarnings(""serial"") to get rid of all such warnings?EDIT:None of my classes implements Serializable interface (or none of their superclasses). And Eclipse is pointing at HashMap<String, Byte> with its warnings. Why doesn't it detect that it's static field? <code>  public final class ConverterTYPE { private final static HashMap<String, Byte> STRING_MAP = new HashMap<String, Byte>() { { put(""A"", new Byte((byte)12)); put(""B"", new Byte((byte)13)); } };}","@SuppressWarnings(""serial"")"

Resolving protected resources with Flying Saucer (ITextRenderer," I'm using Flying Saucer to create a pdf from xhtml, hosted on a tomcat server. Most of the images included in the pdf are publicly available (logos and so on), but some of them are protected behind a login (that is, they are streamed through a servlet if the user is logged in).When I paste the url in the browser, the image is of course displayed fine, because the browser sends the session with the request. But when Flying Saucer renders the pdf, it doesn't include the protected image because it doesn't know anything about the session.So, my question is; is there any way to include the byte streams for Flying Saucer to resolve, just as it is possible to add resolvable fonts? I have tried something like this, but there is no easy way to set the UAC on the ITextRenderer, and it complained every time i tried. <code> ",Resolving protected resources with Flying Saucer (ITextRenderer)
Handling multiple user authentication types in Spring Security 3.x," I have been using Spring Security 3.x for handling user authentication for my projects, and so far, it has worked flawlessly.I recently received the requirements for a new project. In this project, it requires 2 sets of user authentication: one to authenticate employees against LDAP, and another to authenticate customer against database. I'm a little stumped on how to configure that in Spring Security.My initial idea was to create a login screen that has the following fields:-radio button field - for users to choose whether they are employees or customers.j_username user field.j_password password field.If the user selects ""employee"", then I want Spring Security to authenticate them against LDAP, otherwise the credential will be authenticated against database. However, the problem is the form will be submitted to /j_spring_security_check and there's no way for me to send the radio button field to my implemented custom authentication provider. My initial thought is I probably need two form submission URLs rather than relying on the default /j_spring_security_check. Each URL will be handled by different authentication providers, but I'm not sure how to configure that in Spring Security.I know in Spring Security, I can configure fall back authentication, for example if LDAP authentication fails, then it will fall back to database authentication, but this is not what I'm shooting for in this new project. Can someone share how exactly I should configure this in Spring Security 3.x?Thank you.UPDATE - 01-28-2011 - @EasyAngel's techniqueI'm trying to do the following:-Employee form login submits to /j_spring_security_check_for_employeeCustomer form login submits to /j_spring_security_check_for_customerThe reason I want 2 different form logins is to allow me to handle the authentication differently based on the user, instead of doing a fall-back authentication. It is possible that employee and customer have same user ID, in my case.I incorporated @EasyAngel's idea, but have to replace some deprecated classes. The problem I'm currently facing is neither filter processes URLS seem registered in Spring Security because I keep getting Error 404: SRVE0190E: File not found: /j_spring_security_check_for_employee. My gut feeling is the springSecurityFilterChain bean is not wired properly, thus my custom filters are not used at all.By the way, I'm using WebSphere and I do have com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokefilterscompatibility=true property set in the server. I'm able to hit the default /j_spring_security_check without problem.Here's my complete security configuration:- I'm starting a bounty here because I can't seem to get this working for several days already... frustration is the word. I'm hoping someone will point out the problem(s), or if you can show me a better or cleaner way to handle this (in code). I'm using Spring Security 3.x. Thank you.UPDATE 01-29-2011 - @Ritesh's techniqueOkay, I managed to get @Ritesh's approach to work very closely to what I wanted. I have the radiobutton that allows user to select whether they are customer or employee. It seems like this approach is working fairly well, with one problem... If employee logs in with right credential, they are allowed in... WORK AS EXPECTED.If employee logs in with wrong credential, they are not allowed in... WORK AS EXPECTED.If customer logs in with right credential, they are allowed in... WORK AS EXPECTED.If customer logs in with wrong credential, the authentication falls back to employee authentication... DOESN'T WORK. This is risky because if I select customer authentication, and punch it the employee credential, it will allow the user in too and this is not what I want. Here's my updated configuration. It has to be some really small tweak I need to do to prevent the authentication fall back but I can't seem to figure it out now. Thank you.UPDATE - SOLUTION to @Ritesh's techniqueOkay, I think I have solved the problem here. Instead of having EmployeeCustomAuthenticationProvider to rely on the default UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken, I created EmployeeUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken for it, just like the one I created CustomerUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken for CustomerCustomAuthenticationProvider. These providers will then override the supports():-CustomerCustomAuthenticationProvider class EmployeeCustomAuthenticationProvider class MyAuthenticationFilter class ... and WALAA! It works perfectly now after several days of frustration!

F.e., because list is huge and used intensively.I've read about Java, that its optimization policy is strict about multi-threading - if you don't synchronize your code correctly, it is not guaranteed to be executed correctly in inter-thread context - it can reorganize code significantly, providing consistency in context of only one thread (see http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/memory.html#17.3). F.e., op1; op2; op3;may be reorganized in op3; op2; op1;, if it produces same result (in one-thread context).Now I wonder, if I fill my list before wrapping it by synchronizedList,then wrap it up,then use by different thread, - is there a possibility, that different thread will see this list filled only partially or not filled at all?

How to retreive raw post data from HttpServletRequest in java," I'm trying to get the post data in Java. Seems like it should be one of the simplest things to do right? I mean, HttpServletRequest.getParameter has to do it right? So how can you get the raw post data?I found HttpServletRequest get JSON POST data and used Kdeveloper's code to pull the post data from a request. It works, but theres a catch: I can only get that post data once.Heres the method I made from Kdeveloper's code: Previously I had closed the reader at the end of this method, but that caused exceptions when the method ran more than once on the same request. Without closing it, no exceptions happen, but the method returns an empty string.Honestly, there should just be an exposed req.getPostData() method - did no one think that would be useful?So how can I write this method such that it always returns the correct post data? <code>  public static String getPostData(HttpServletRequest req) { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); try { BufferedReader reader = req.getReader(); reader.mark(10000); String line; do { line = reader.readLine(); sb.append(line).append(""\n""); } while (line != null); reader.reset(); // do NOT close the reader here, or you won't be able to get the post data twice } catch(IOException e) { logger.warn(""getPostData couldn't.. get the post data"", e); // This has happened if the request's reader is closed } return sb.toString();}",How to retrieve raw post data from HttpServletRequest in java

C# way slower than Java in memory access with loops?," I have two pieces of code that are identical in C# and Java. But the Java one goes twice as fast. I want to know why. Both work with the same principal of using a big lookup table for performance.Why is the Java going 50% faster than C#? Java code: It just enumerates through all possible 7 card combinations. The C# version is identical except at the end it uses Console.writeLine.The lookuptable is defined as: Its size in memory is about 120 Megabytes.The C# version has the same test code. It's measured with Stopwatch instead of nanoTime() and uses Console.WriteLine instead of System.out.println("""") but it takes at least double the time.Java takes about 400ms. For compilation in java I use the -server flag. In C# the build is set to release without debug or trace defines.What is responsible for the speed difference? <code>  int h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7; int u0, u1, u2, u3, u4, u5; long time = System.nanoTime(); long sum = 0; for (h1 = 1; h1 < 47; h1++) { u0 = handRanksj[53 + h1]; for (h2 = h1 + 1; h2 < 48; h2++) { u1 = handRanksj[u0 + h2]; for (h3 = h2 + 1; h3 < 49; h3++) { u2 = handRanksj[u1 + h3]; for (h4 = h3 + 1; h4 < 50; h4++) { u3 = handRanksj[u2 + h4]; for (h5 = h4 + 1; h5 < 51; h5++) { u4 = handRanksj[u3 + h5]; for (h6 = h5 + 1; h6 < 52; h6++) { u5 = handRanksj[u4 + h6]; for (h7 = h6 + 1; h7 < 53; h7++) { sum += handRanksj[u5 + h7]; }}}}}}} double rtime = (System.nanoTime() - time)/1e9; // time given is start time System.out.println(sum); static int handRanksj[];",C# is half as slow than Java in memory access with loops?

Why google api clients are not built on top of Apache Abdera project ?," First of all I want to give many thanks to Google GData API's engineers for their good work and I'd like to mention that this question is not meant to criticize anything.

It's like writing a new JDK for a Java project, because abdera client does what google api client library does and abdera server features and adapters could be used as well for many things, like entry persistence and many others.I'm aware of the fact that google data protocol is a little specific atom publishing, but if one needs to use some of the fancy extensions and features that Apache Abdera project offers for this protocol, it is better not to use google api client library and implement the client from scratch with Abdera... And I'm sure that in a lot of cases its features such as Abdera's JCR adapter would become very handy for google docs, google translator toolkit and practically for most of the others.Now it's great that there is a google api client library to be used for google docs, but what am I going to do with the documents and atom feed responses? I believe that in more than a half cases there is also a repository or database on the other side. And in that case, abdera is needed, not the simple google api clients that are only marshalling/unmarshalling the feeds...In fact, there is something to persist in all of the google APIs. It would make sense, if google decided to invest the effort into Abdera enhancement or integration... This doesn't... Especially considering a very known fact in software development, that second release is usually rewritten from scratch. Apache Abdera is a mature project with 5 years of its existence, used by tons of apps.If there are reasons, that I don't see and implementing the client with the use of pull parser only was really necessary, I would at least use a xml pull parser that is not deprecated.

RESTEasy will not map my Spring bean," RESTEasy 2.0.1GAJava 1.6Spring 3.0.3I have tried everything I can, and cannot make head or tail of what's going on. I have a Spring MVC application, however I'd like to have some RESTEasy endpoints available outside the Spring MVC app, but in the same container, ultimately being able to wire in the same beans. As a first step, I'm simply trying to stand-up RESTEasy inside the container, serving requests from a Spring-configured bean. I have tried the boilerplate from the instructions and have also tried manual setup, to no avail.Bean web.xml applicationContext.xml According to the documentation, all I have to do is manually register the RESTeasy BeanFactoryPostProcessor by allocating an instance of org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.spring.SpringBeanProcessor. I believe this spring configuration does that.Jetty starts and the app context spins up with no issues. Application works normally, however when I (""ei"" is the application context). The log shows (this and only this): Even if I could convince RESTEasy to show me the mappings, it seems that it's just not discovering my bean.If I map it explicitly via the resteasy.resources context param, it works, though obviously doesn't have access to auto-wired Spring beans.Anything else I can try? I have debug log on the entire RESTEasy codebase and I don't get any messages. I've also confirmed that Spring is, in fact, creating my bean, so it's just that RESTEasy isn't finding it.  <code>  @Resource@Path(""/"")public class NeighborComparison { private String foo; @GET @Path(value=""customer"") @Produces(""text/plain"") public String getNeighborComparison() { return ""foo""; }} <context-param> <param-name>resteasy.servlet.mapping.prefix</param-name> <param-value>/api</param-value></context-param><listener> <listener-class>org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.ResteasyBootstrap</listener-class></listener><!-- NOT configuring SpringContextLoaderListener because I declare my own, so if I do, everything blows up, plus all it actually does is sanity check configuration --><listener> <listener-class>com.example.MyCustomContextLoaderListener</listener-class></listener><servlet> <servlet-name>Resteasy</servlet-name> <servlet-class>org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.HttpServletDispatcher</servlet-class></servlet><servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>Resteasy</servlet-name> <url-pattern>/api/*</url-pattern></servlet-mapping> <bean id=""resteasy.providerFactory"" class=""org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResteasyProviderFactory"" factory-method=""getInstance""></bean><bean id=""resteasy.dispatcher"" class=""org.jboss.resteasy.core.SynchronousDispatcher""> <constructor-arg ref=""resteasy.providerFactory""/></bean><bean id=""resteasy.spring.bean.processor"" class=""org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.spring.SpringBeanProcessor""> <description> Add Resources and @Providers to the appropriate places in Resteasy's infrastructure </description> <constructor-arg ref=""resteasy.dispatcher""/></bean><bean id=""neighborComparison"" class=""opower.api.customer.neighbor_comparison.NeighborComparison""></bean> > curl -H""Accept: text/plain"" localhost:8080/ei/api/customer 2011-03-29 16:44:24,153 DEBUG [qtp-575315405-0] [EI] [] [asy.core.SynchronousDispatcher] PathInfo: /customer2011-03-29 16:44:24,156 DEBUG [qtp-575315405-0] [EI] [] [asy.core.SynchronousDispatcher] Failed executing GET /customerorg.jboss.resteasy.spi.NotFoundException: Could not find resource for relative : /customer of full path: http://localhost:8080/ei/api/customer",RESTEasy will not map my Spring bean with custom Spring ContextLoader

Java NIO Non-Blocking Write," So here I am reading one of my favorite software pattern books (Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture - Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects), specifically the sections on Proactor/Reactor asynchronous IO patterns. I can see how by using selectable channels I can implement a Reactor style asynchronous IO mechanism quite easy (and have done so). But, I cannot see how I would implement a proper Proactor mechanism with non-blocking writes. That is taking advantage of OS managed non-blocking write functions. Functionality supported by OS specific calls like GetQueuedCompletionStatus under win32. I did see that Java 7 brings some updates to NIO with asynchronous completion handlers (which seems to be in the right direction). That being said... Given the lack of unified cross-platform support for OS managed async operations (specifically async write) I am assuming that this is a quassy-implementation that is not utilizing native OS support.So my questions are, is proactor based IO handling possible in Java in such a way that it is advantageous to use for specific scenarios; and, if Java NIO does support proactor based IO handling (either in Java 6 or Java 7) is OS managed asynchronous IO support (i.e. completion callbacks from the OS) being utilized? Furthermore, if the implementation is purely in-VM are the performance benefits so little that using proactive event handling offers nothing more than a different (possibly simpler) way of constructing concurrent network handling software.For anyone interested in proactive event handling here is a good article that outlines pros / cons and a comparison to both traditional thread-per-connection and reactive IO models. <code> ",Java Non-Blocking and Asynchronous IO with NIO & NIO.2 (JSR203) - Reactor/Proactor Implementations

Spring startup performance issues.," I'm trying to integrate Spring in a pretty large application with thousands of classes, and i'm experiencing huge delays starting my container because of component-scanning.I have already narrowed the number of directories specified in the ""base-package"", to the minimum in order to reduce the time wasted in scanning irrelevant directories, but the class-path scanning part of initialization still takes about 1-2 mins.So, is there a way to optimize the scanning process ? I've thought of storing the candidate classes path in a file and make the container then get them from the file instead of scanning the class-path with every startup, but i don't really know where to start or if that is even possible.Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks in advance. Edit1: Loading bean definitions form an autogenerated xml file, reduced the Spring bootstrap time to 9~10 secs which confirms that the reflection api used by Spring for the components class-path scanning is the major source of startup delays.As for generating the xml file here is the code, since it might be helpful for someone with the same issues.

Except then I figured, that what I really want is to handle a wrapped exception separately, since I know its semantics are to wrap a checked exception, so I wrote this helper class: and then I can do this: and it seems to work great.But now I'm thinking, well, if I want to use this in a library as well as an application that uses the library, now they both depend on WrappedException, so it should really be in a base library that I can include everywhere.Which makes me think, maybe Guava has a standard WrappedException class somewhere, since I now include Guava as a dependency by default. So I can just do or or I just looked around in Guava and found Throwables which has Throwables.propagate() that looks similar, but it just wraps checked exceptions in a RuntimeException, rather than a special subclass of RuntimeException.Which approach is better? Should I not be using a special WrappedException as compared with a RuntimeException? My top-level code wants to know the topmost exception that adds informational value.If I have a RuntimeException that wraps a NastyException that wraps a NullPointerException, the wrapping RuntimeException doesn't add informational value, and I don't care about it, so the error I would log would be the NastyException.If I have an IllegalArgumentException that wraps a NastyException, the IllegalArgumentException does generally add informational value.So in my top code that does error logging, I'd have to do something like this: The philosophy feels right for me, but the implementation feels bad.

java when do you need to explicitly call a superclass constructor," So say I have a subclass that extends a superclass. In what scenarios do I need to explicitly type super() to get the superclass constructor to run? I'm looking at an example in a book about abstract classes and when they extend it with a non-abstract subclass, the subclass's default constructor is blank and there's a comment that says the superclass's default constructor will be called. At the same time I've also seen instances on here where someone's problem was not explicitly calling super(). Is the distinction from calling the superclass's default/non-default constructor from the subclass's default/non-default constructor? <code> ",When do you need to explicitly call a superclass constructor?

Prevent network sync trigger when syncing from network in Android ContentProvider," I'm writing my own ContentProvider which will be synced to a web service using a SyncAdapter. Problem happens when the sync adapter is modifying the content provider's data the provider triggers a network sync when internally calling getContentResolver().notifyChange causing a sync loop.The notifyChange with the network sync flag is required for when a client application does the modification but should be avoided when the sync adapter is modifying.How can one, inside a contentprovider, easly tell if it's being used by a client application (which should trigger network sync upon modification) or by a sync adapter (which should not trigger network sync).Currently I'm using different CONTENT_URI's (sync adapter accesses the data using a CONTENT_URI_NO_SYNC and client apps using a CONTENT_URI) to be able to distinguish between the two types of access and set the network sync flag accordingly. <code> ",Prevent network sync loop when syncing from network in Android ContentProvider
Sharing IntelliJ project with SVN between two computers," I'm trying to share a project between my desktop and laptop using Subversion. The project has 3 modules. I've imported the project folder into a repository in a shared folder that my laptop can access over the network. I checked the project out on my laptop and then tried to open the project. None of the modules are visible, only the project's .iml file, as in the screenshot below.I notice that the .iml file has a line for ""content url"", which refers to a location on my desktop. Maybe this is the problem. What can I do about it? Do I have to create a new project on the laptop and import the modules - so there would be 2 different top level .iml files, one for the desktop and one for the laptop? Am I going about this the wrong way?UPDATE: The problem seems to be with committing. When I make a change in a file, save, and hit Commit Changes, I get a popup saying ""No changes detected"". This is the same on both laptop and desktop, and meant that I downloaded the wrong version onto my laptop before. I deleted the repository and created a new one, and my project works on my laptop now, but I can't commit changes from within IntelliJ (only with TortoiseSVN via file manager). Also, when I imported my project into version control from my desktop computer, the working copy wasn't put under version control. So I can't update from my desktop unless I check it out to a different folder.I think there is something wrong with the SVN plugin with this version of IntelliJ (10.5.1). Does anyone else have problems with committing changes?RESOLUTION I needed to1) Update Settings | Version Control to map Subversion to the working directory2) Import into Version Control3) Check it out againIt may possibly have been caused by the fact that the modules were originally standalone projects which were in separate repositories. Whatever the cause, IntelliJ's ""No changes detected"" dialog isn't the most helpful. <code> ","IntelliJ and SVN: ""no changes detected"" upon commit"

How to use CipherOutputStream correctly to encrypt and decrypt log file (log created with log4j)," I have a problem in encrypting/decrypting log file generated by log4j's RollingFileAppender. For the encryption I have tried to extend the RollingFileAppender, just call it EncryptedRollingFileAppender. I override the method and basically I use CipherOutputStream and Base64OutputStream to encrypt and encode everything written to the output stream. Here's part of the code: And then i decrypt the file with this code: It worked but only partially. Some texts in the result file were decrypted correctly but some others were not. If you're curious, this is what I mean by partially: I also have tried changing the algorithm to ""DESede"" but it was still partially decrypted. Then I tried to use ""CBC/PKCS5Padding"" in both ends but I got an exception I assume the encryption is not properly padding the input but I wonder why... because when I use the same encryption and decryption algorithms without the CipherOutputStream the padding worked just fine.Anyone can help me to make this works?

Java: How to get Biggest BigDecimal Value," How can I get the largest possible value of a BigDecimal variable can hold?

Is there any way to programmatically generate java class from a template ?," I need a library or method to generate a java class (just generating source code of class as text format, no need to run or use it) from a template text file. as an example I have a class template and I want to add an library import, a function import and a parameter or line addition to template and add template to a project. //OPERATIONSafter import operations the code will be like : I searched some libraries for this operations FreeMarker and ApacheVelocity are recomended for some similar problems.

Is it wise to use Generics for Exceptions?," My team is in the middle of cleaning up our use of throws Exception and either removing or replacing them with specific exceptions. A common throws is because an entity was not found. Should we be throwing a generic NotFoundException or a specific SomeClassNotFoundException for each entity class?If we should be throwing a specific exception, should we be creating a specific Exception class for each entity type? Can we safely use generics? Like this class NotFoundException<T extends EntityBaseClass> extends Exception and then the constructor takes care of declaring what Entity type we're dealing with?If we should be throwing a specific exception and not using generics, should those exceptions extend or implement a NotFoundException abstract class or interface? <code> ",Is it wise to use generics for exceptions?
Calling VBA code from Java," I have an Excel file with a large set of VBA code. There are 4 public subroutines that take no parameters that can be called by the user when the document is opened in Excel, these manipulate the data in the various sheets as needed. We have a large Java application that we would like to interact with this document by calling the Macros from the Java environment. The point is that we only have to write the VBA code once and then Java can call it for execution. Furthermore, we want to assume that the user of the Java application does not necessarily have immediate access to Excel, but is operating on a Windows machine. How should one go about doing this?Do we compile the VBA code into a DLL, and call it from within Java? How do you compile the DLL, does that require the use of Visual Studio? How do we call the DLL from Java? Should we try some sort of COM object? <code> ",How do I call VBA code in an Excel spreadsheet from Java?

Java: Why does SSL handshake give 'Could not generate DH keypair' exception?," When I make an SSL connection with some IRC servers (but not others - presumably due to the server's preferred encryption method) I get the following exception: Final cause: An example of a server that demonstrates this problem is aperture.esper.net:6697 (this is an IRC server). An example of a server that does not demonstrate the problem is kornbluth.freenode.net:6697. [Not surprisingly, all servers on each network share the same respective behaviour.]My code (which as noted does work when connecting to some SSL servers) is: It's that last startHandshake that throws the exception. And yes there is some magic going on with the 'trustAllCerts'; that code forces the SSL system not to validate certs. (So... not a cert problem.)Obviously one possibility is that esper's server is misconfigured, but I searched and didn't find any other references to people having problems with esper's SSL ports, and 'openssl' connects to it (see below). So I'm wondering if this is a limitation of Java default SSL support, or something. Any suggestions?Here's what happens when I connect to aperture.esper.net 6697 using 'openssl' from commandline: As noted, after all that, it does connect successfully which is more than you can say for my Java app.Should it be relevant, I'm using OS X 10.6.8, Java version 1.6.0_26. <code>  Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not generate DH keypair at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.DHCrypt.<init>(DHCrypt.java:106) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.ClientHandshaker.serverKeyExchange(ClientHandshaker.java:556) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.ClientHandshaker.processMessage(ClientHandshaker.java:183) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Handshaker.processLoop(Handshaker.java:593) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Handshaker.process_record(Handshaker.java:529) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.readRecord(SSLSocketImpl.java:893) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.performInitialHandshake(SSLSocketImpl.java:1138) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(SSLSocketImpl.java:1165) ... 3 more Caused by: java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: Prime size must be multiple of 64, and can only range from 512 to 1024 (inclusive) at com.sun.crypto.provider.DHKeyPairGenerator.initialize(DashoA13*..) at java.security.KeyPairGenerator$Delegate.initialize(KeyPairGenerator.java:627) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.DHCrypt.<init>(DHCrypt.java:100) ... 10 more SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(""SSL""); sslContext.init(null, trustAllCerts, new SecureRandom()); s = (SSLSocket)sslContext.getSocketFactory().createSocket(); s.connect(new InetSocketAddress(host, port), timeout); s.setSoTimeout(0); ((SSLSocket)s).startHandshake(); ~ $ openssl s_client -connect aperture.esper.net:6697CONNECTED(00000003)depth=0 /C=GB/ST=England/L=London/O=EsperNet/OU=aperture.esper.net/CN=*.esper.net/emailAddress=support@esper.netverify error:num=18:self signed certificateverify return:1depth=0 /C=GB/ST=England/L=London/O=EsperNet/OU=aperture.esper.net/CN=*.esper.net/emailAddress=support@esper.netverify return:1---Certificate chain 0 s:/C=GB/ST=England/L=London/O=EsperNet/OU=aperture.esper.net/CN=*.esper.net/emailAddress=support@esper.net i:/C=GB/ST=England/L=London/O=EsperNet/OU=aperture.esper.net/CN=*.esper.net/emailAddress=support@esper.net---Server certificate-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----[There was a certificate here, but I deleted it to save space]-----END CERTIFICATE-----subject=/C=GB/ST=England/L=London/O=EsperNet/OU=aperture.esper.net/CN=*.esper.net/emailAddress=support@esper.netissuer=/C=GB/ST=England/L=London/O=EsperNet/OU=aperture.esper.net/CN=*.esper.net/emailAddress=support@esper.net---No client certificate CA names sent---SSL handshake has read 2178 bytes and written 468 bytes---New, TLSv1/SSLv3, Cipher is DHE-RSA-AES256-SHAServer public key is 2048 bitSecure Renegotiation IS supportedCompression: NONEExpansion: NONESSL-Session: Protocol : TLSv1 Cipher : DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA Session-ID: 51F1D40A1B044700365D3BD1C61ABC745FB0C347A334E1410946DCB5EFE37AFD Session-ID-ctx: Master-Key: DF8194F6A60B073E049C87284856B5561476315145B55E35811028C4D97F77696F676DB019BB6E271E9965F289A99083 Key-Arg : None Start Time: 1311801833 Timeout : 300 (sec) Verify return code: 18 (self signed certificate)---",Why does SSL handshake give 'Could not generate DH keypair' exception?

Android - different behaviour in release singed build?," Having some really strange ""bugs"" with my Android application at the minute, it I run it from Eclipse it runs fine, pretty much perfect.It contains a login screen that I can access and get to my main screen fine when running through Eclipse. When I press the home key and return to my application it returns to the last position (Activity) the application was in.However when I release sign a build and deploy it on the device it has different behavior,after going through the login screen when I press home and then return to the application the login screen always appears.Code is identical in both builds, only difference is one is signed with the default debug keystore while the other is signed with my own release keystore.Has anyone come across this? Its really confusing!EDIT: More info:The application currently works like this:Main activity is launched which then calls the login activity, login activity then moves to my app core activity.I have also discovered that it appears to be on the first run after install that I have the issue, if I run the app, force close it and then run it again it then runs perfectly without any issue.So it seems to be something really strange? <code> ",Android - different behaviour in release signed build?

Database theory in android with SQLite," I'm quite inexperienced with using databases in applications, so I need a bit of guidance.I have a Java object with several primitive fields, and several references to Strings and ArrayList objects. The primitives and Strings map nicely to available SQLite fields, but I'm not sure how I can persist the ArrayLists. I was entertaining two ideas, one of which is to serialise the ArrayLists and store them in a Text field, the other is to have a column which points to a table with arity 1, in which I can store the individual strings, but I'm unsure of how to implement this in android. I'm open to different approaches, but I wouldn't know how to implement the latter in java using SQLite, so a solution would be lovely.

How to provide a context configuration for a web application under Tomcat?," I have a web application that relies on some resources and parameters to be configured after it is installed, like a JDBC connection.What I have come up with is providing a META-INF/context.xml which is copied into [engine-name]/[server-name]/[app-name].xml by Tomcat when I deploy the application. This way all I am providing is a war file that can be copied into the appBase folder (webapps).Tomcat's documentation says if there is such a file it won't be overwritten which is really great, since the changes made after deployment won't be lost.But there is a subtle issue here:Since we deploy the application by copying into webapps directory, Tomcat will first uninstall the existing application as well as the configuration file. This way the configuration file will be lost / overwritten which is not desirable.Tomcat won't modify this behaviour as far as I know.The question is:Is there a way to work around this issue by installing the application in a way that Tomcat won't remove the existing configuration file.Or, is there a better way of packaging the application?Please note that we don't want to set autoDeploy to false and we cannot use human intervention for the installation (which rules out using Tomcat Manager web application).If I get the configuration file out of .war file and copy it separately as [engine-name]/[server-name]/[app-name].xml, Tomcat will still associate it with my application and remove it once I copy a new .war file.Another assumption is: We don't know in advance the values to the configuration. We will only provide a sample configuration (a placeholder, if you wish) while actual configuration will be performed at some time later (not necessarily in the installation time).

How do I implement a constant-time string comparison in Java?," I want to implement a String comparison function that doesn't take a different amount of time depending on the number of characters that match or the position of the first mismatch. I assume there must be a library out there somewhere that provides this, but I was unable to find it via a quick search.So far, the best idea I've got is to sum the XOR of each character and return whether or not the sum is 0. However, I'm pretty sure this wouldn't work so well with Unicode. I also have a vague concern that HotSpot would do some optimizations that would change my constant-time property, but I can't think of a specific optimization that would do this off the top of my head.Thanks.UPDATE: Sorry, I don't believe I was clear. I'm not looking for O(1), I'm looking for something that won't leak timing information. This would be used to compare hashed password values, and if the time it took to compare was different based on where the first mismatch occurred, that would be leaking information to an attacker. <code> ",How do I implement a string comparison in Java that takes the same amount of time no matter whether they match or where a mismatch (if any) occurs?

Factory Pattern to expose multiple Interfaces," I am currently working on a project where I am attempting to hide as much detail about a hierarchy I have created as possible. I want to do this to minimize the amount of information the user needs to know about objects (and to control what they can do to the state of the object). In addition, I'm using the pattern to limit what kinds of objects the application can make, and limit it to creation from the factory.The main issue I am having, however, is that there are a few different kinds of interfaces I would like to expose. Each interface is has additional functionality that I don't believe should be shared, and I would like to keep these interfaces separated. Finally, I don't know what new interfaces may come in the future, but I'd like to try and be ready for them.Weapon: Firearm: My question is what would be the best way to have the factory produce objects with different interfaces? Here's what I am thinking ""the best would be"":The most clear to the user (it's obvious what they're asking for and what they're getting back)The best for future expansion (I am uncertain what new interfaces I will be adding to this system).Here's what I have been thinking so far:Create properly named methods for each interface Do the above, but produce the factories in separately named classes Something completely differentI'm open to suggestions, and changes. This is a flexible project, so I can change as much as I want to (in terms of this portion of the project) to make a better result.Also - As a side note, I was uncertain if this question was too open-ended or not for SO. If I made a mistake posting here, let me know and I'll move my question elsewhere. <code>  public interface Weapon extends GameObject { Number attack(); boolean addWeaponAttribute(WeaponAttribute attribute);} public interface Firearm extends Weapon { void reload(Number rounds);} public static Firearm getFirearm(String firearmName) { ...}public static Weapon getWeapon(String weaponName) { ...} public class WeaponFactory { public static Weapon getWeapon(String weaponName) { ... }}public class FirearmFactory { public static Firearm getFirearm(String firearmName) { ... }}",Techniques to expose multiple Interfaces (via static creation methods)
Sorting and then arranging - java," This was a question in one my friend's programming class.Q.

Focus temporary changes to null," I'm pretty new to Swing development, hope my question is not a stupid one.I've got a following problem. I am tracking the focus using KeyboardFocusManager, listening for property permanentFocusOwner changes. However when the focus changes from one control to another, I get intermediate change of permanentFocusOwner property to null.My current UI logic is making some changes to the controls when the focus is inside one of the panels or its child panels. However getting intermediate null breaks this logic.I searched in Google for information about this problem, didn't find anything relevant.The question is, whether this behaviour is by design, and if there is some way to workaround intermediate nulls.Here is the minimal application reproducing the said behaviour: The log output is: (program start, focus sets to button 1 automatically) permanentFocusOwner changed from: null permanentFocusOwner changed to : javax.swing.JButton[,0,18,41x26, (skipped)] (clicked on button 2) permanentFocusOwner changed from: javax.swing.JButton[,0,18,41x26, (skipped)] permanentFocusOwner changed to : null permanentFocusOwner changed from: null permanentFocusOwner changed to : javax.swing.JButton[,41,18,41x26, (skipped)] (optional part, on the code intention)My goal is to make something looking like a list view, where the entries expand and display more information when they get focus (and collapse back when they lose it). The expanded view contains some additional buttons.JList doesn't seem to be the appropriate control, because (1) it doesn't allow clicks on the buttons, and (2) its entries have constant height, whereas I want the entries to expand dynamically on focus. JTable with its edit mode seems to be not an appropriate solution as well, at least because of constant entry size.So I am using plain JPanel with a vertical box layout as a container, and subscribe to model changes and update the visuals manually. The problem is that when I click on a button, the containing list item loses focus. I could detect that the focus still stays within the list item if the focus wouldn't change to null temporarily. <code>  import java.awt.*;import java.beans.*;import javax.swing.*;public class FocusNullTest extends JFrame { public static void main(String[] args) { EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { FocusNullTest self = new FocusNullTest(); self.setVisible(true); } }); } public FocusNullTest() { setSize(150, 100); setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); Container contentPane = getContentPane(); contentPane.setLayout(new BoxLayout(contentPane, BoxLayout.X_AXIS)); contentPane.add(new JButton(""1"")); contentPane.add(new JButton(""2"")); KeyboardFocusManager focusManager = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager(); focusManager.addPropertyChangeListener( ""permanentFocusOwner"", new PropertyChangeListener() { @Override public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent e) { System.out.println(""permanentFocusOwner changed from: "" + e.getOldValue()); System.out.println(""permanentFocusOwner changed to : "" + e.getNewValue()); } }); }}",Focus owner temporary changes to null

Why do JPA validation Min/Max constraints not support the double type?," Could somebody please explain to me why the JPA supports the double type as a field type, but the bean validation constaints in javax.validation.constraints (i.e. @Min/@Max) do not support it?I know documentation says this is due to rounding errors, but if I choose the field type to be double I already admit that I don't care that much about the explicit precision.The scenario I ran into this dilemma is the following: I have an Entity that represents a point on the earth's surface. If the precision is within a few centimeters it's fine. It looks something like this: Unfortunately this does not work, because the annotations do not support the double type. But using BigDecimal instead is not really an option, because I have some extensive computation with multiple points going on that still needs to be reasonably fast. I worked around it by defining a custom constraint check that does work with doubles, but somehow I think there is something I'm missing in the whole story. So, what am I missing? <code>  @Entitypublic class Point { /** * The longitude in radians. */ @Min(-Math.Pi) @Max(Math.Pi) double longitude; /** * The latitude in radians. */ @Min(-Math.Pi / 2) @Max(Math.Pi / 2) double latitude;}",Why do bean validation Min/Max constraints not support the double type?

OSGi Benefits Over JEE?," So I took some time this afternoon to finally sit down and begin reading up on the mysterious and elusive ""OSGi"" and its so-called bundles.OK, so I think I get it. An OSGi ""bundle"" is basically a JAR with some additional manifest information. And, instead of deploying it to a normal application server (or other container), you deploy it to an OSGi server like Apache Felix. It run and then provides services to users/clients.How is this any different than a normal EAR being deployed to an app server???OSGi seems to be on the rise (I keep running into it!), but for the life of me I don't understand what it offers (feature-wise) over anything you can do with real-deal enterprise server like GlassFish or Spring.I know the world hasn't gone crazy, so I'm obviously missing something.

Strategy for duplicate entries in a binary search tree," I have a BST which has duplicate entries. I am trying to find duplicate entries. Now obviously I can write a dumb algorithm which traverses the whole tree, which is easy.However, I want to write a more efficient one. Here's what I've done/thought so far:Assume the following tree. If I want to find all 8's, I will first find the 8 on the left subtree of the 10. To find a duplicate, if it has no right child, is it going to be the left-most node on the right-subtree of the the first parent that is larger than that node (8)? And if it did have a right child, then it can be either in the left most node of its right subtree or the right most node on its left subtree?Are those all the cases, which can be achieved with a bunch of loops and if-statements?If not, what's a better approach? Can anyone help?ThanksEDIT:Actually I just realized it can't be the ""left most node"" or ""right most node"". That would find the node that is the next highest value or the previous lowest value. Would it be one node before?EDIT 2:Fixed my BST example. It follows the following insertion method: This means duplicates will be added to the right of their duplicates.. right? <code>  10 / \ 5 15 /\ / \ 2 8 10 16 \ \ 8 12 if (node == null) return new NodeBST<Value>(name, value);if (node.key().compareTo(name) > 0) node.setLeft(insert(node.left(), name, value)); else node.setRight(insert(node.right(), name, value));",Strategy to find duplicate entries in a binary search tree

Finding a point on a bezier curve when given the distance from the start point?," I created a 4 point Bzier curve, and a distance. Starting at the start point, how do I find the x,y coordinates of a point which is that distance away from the start point? I've looked at the other examples, and from what I can tell, they approximate the values by dividing the curve into several thousand points, then finding the nearest point. This will not work for me. For what I'm doing, I'd like to be accurate to only two decimal places. Below is a simple form of what I have to create my Bzier curve. (The y values are arbitrary, the x values are always 352 pixels apart). If it matters, I'm working in Java. So assuming my start point is 0,400, how do I find the coordinates of a point that is 35 distance form that start point(along the curve)? (Ideally something not processor intensive.

JSF input filed to Double conversion error," I have a JSF2 application that uses Spring 3.0. I have a bean that has a property of type List<Double> with 5 elements: In my xhtml file I have this for every element: My purpose is to retrieve the values as ArrayList. Also, I do not want to keep individual properties for each member. A future requirement will make the value's total number to be dynamic (not the hard-coded 5), so I may use a loop to define the inputs for each element, but lets not focus on this now.So here is the problem. When I submit the page, the conversion is not correct. For instance, if my input was 1, 2.0, 3 (and 2 empty inputs for the last two elements, they are not mandatory), I am receiving the following array [1, ""2.0"", 3, """", """"], where 1 and 3 are of type BigDecimal, and 2.0 and the last 2 members are empty strings. This causes ClassCastexception each time I try to get a member of the array list, because by definition is generic and the generic type is Double. BigDecimal cannot be cast to Double; it is obvious that the string cast attempts will also fail. Now, I'd have expected at least all members to be converted by the converter and be of the same type. Also, I need a way to get correctly as Double. I also tried the following: but it caused an exception:<f:converter> Default behavior invoked of requiring a converter-id passed in the constructor, must override ConvertHandler(ConverterConfig)I must admit I am new to the JSF technology, but as far as this article is concerned, there was no need to override anything.

Stop eclipse switcth to Debug tab," My problem is somewhat like the question here and here, but none of those answer can apply to my situation.I am running tomcat inside Eclipse, and my project has some quartz job that run by schedule. Those quartz job meets null pointer exception very often (since they must parse documents from an untrusted source) and surely the team who are working with those jobs can't fix them right away.The result is that Eclipse pop up debug tab every now and then, usually take up focus so that I can't look what happen in console. Moreover, when Eclipse meet the exception, it pop out to take focus out of the program I currently work in (browser, email,...). It is very annoying.Can I simply skip all the null pointer exceptions (since the fail of the jobs doesn't affect my program anyway) or is there a way to keep the focus on the console tab, and keep Eclipse doesn't complain everytime an exception pop out?I'm very thankful for any possible solution.UPDATE: I'm using Eclipse Helios with few plugins. <code> ",Stop eclipse switch to Debug tab

Adding other video codecs to JavaFX 2.0," Update:Since the media side of JFX has been open sourced, I've looked into this myself and it is indeed possible, but requires changing and rebuilding the JFX source (both Java and C parts.) The process is described here for anyone that wants to have a go - I add MKV support in that example, but it should be very similar for other plugins.The remainder of the question is thus mainly historical, but I'll leave it here for reference.BackgroundI've been using VLCJ thus far for playing video in my application. It works, but if possible I'd like to see if I can achieve a similar level of support for common codecs by migrating to JavaFX and saving myself a lot of hassle with multiple VMs and suchlike that VLCJ needs to play multiple videos reliably. I won't go into it here but see my answer to this question if you're interested in the details. There's also the issue of cross-platform compatibility, it works on Mac and Linux ok but I haven't worked out how to get it to show on Mac yet (I believe there's some security in place to prevent one process gaining access to another's native components, but again that's beyond the scope of this question.)It boils down to the fact that while it works, it's a lot of maintenance and hassle working with multiple VMs and bridging them stably if there's another solution that would be easier. VLC does have a pretty legendary level of support for playing pretty much anything which is why I've gone with it thus far, and I'd be interested to see if I can get a similar result in JavaFX - or at least if it can provide the means for doing so in a cross platform manner.ResearchJavaFX 2.0 supports video - great! But at the moment the official line is it supports ""FLV containing VP6 video and MP3 audio"". Is there a way to extend this to add in support for more codecs? There's no hard codec that I'd like to support, it's more a case of as many as I can so I'm looking for an extensible method to go about the above.I wondered if it would play video for codecs installed natively on the machine and that it just doesn't advertise itself as such (because that functionality obviously is machine dependant and not cross-platform.) But no dice, I've tried a number of common formats and it really does refuse to play anything other than what it states.From looking at JavaFX 1.3 it also supports other platform dependant codecs depending on where it's installed. Is there a way to get this behaviour with JavaFX 2? Or is it planned at all for a subsequent release? I haven't been able to find any information on it on the roadmap or any comment from Oracle about it.Only thing I could find from searching extensively is here which implies that it may be possible but no-one seems to know how. I'd also be interested to know if it's based on GStreamer why all the formats supported by GStreamer aren't included by default either?In terms of playing DVDs with JavaFX I've got absolutely nowhere, so I'm assuming that's just a no-go at the moment. If anyone does have any ideas or information though, I'm all ears.Other approachesOne approach which I was half wondering may be possible is crowbarring the JMC jar out of the old JavaFX as described here and trying to get that working alongside JavaFX 2.

java hashtable hashfunktion remove method," I have read about hashtable and open adrdessing. If you want to insert the keys: 18,32,44 in an hashtable with size 13: You'll get a collision because there are already something on index 5. If you use linear probing you'll do hashfunction = (key+i) modulus N where i = 0,1,2.. until you find an empty place in the hashtable. Then 44 will get be inserted at index 7.What if you delete 32, and then you want to delete 44. You start by looking at hashfunction(44)=5 - that was not 44, then hashfunction(44 + 1) = 6 - that is empty. Then you might think that 44 is gone. How do you mark a place in the hashtable, that the place is not really empty, but does not contain a key, and that you should keep looking for 44 at the next index?If you then need to insert another key at index 6 then the key just overwrites the ""mark"" in the hashtable.What could you use to mark an index - saying here has been an key, but has been deleted - so you continue to look at next index? You can't just write null or 0 because then either you think the key has been deleted (null) or that an key with value 0 has overwritten 44. <code>  18 gets index 5 (18 modulus 13 = 5)32 gets index 6 (32 modulus 13 = 6)44 gets index 5 (44 modulus 13 = 5)",Handling hash collisions when using linear probing

What languages other than Java have security models for unpriviledged vs. priviledged code?," I recently learned about Java's security model. Most people think Java is secure because it is immune to buffer overflows, etc, but there is this entire Java security model centered around checking whether code has permission to take certain actions. They're really solving a challenging problem: how to let arbitrary untrusted code (say in a web browser) run but be prevented from accessing the underlying system in malicious ways while retaining the ability to interact with the system in some ways.Sandboxed C++ or something like that would have been very difficult to even attempt because the language dictates that you be able to do pointer arithmetic, etc., allowing malicious code to corrupt other parts of the process. Since there are many memory-safe languages, though, I was wondering what other languages have sophisticated security models and how they compare to Java's. I don't know offhand how many languages strive to have concepts like ""sandbox"", etc. I'm looking for some pointers to learn about this interesting direction of computer security. <code> ",What languages other than Java have security models for unprivileged vs. privileged code?

Android: Fragments onClick method in fragment element," I read quite some articles about fragments, but I am still confused about how to do what.I have a MainActivity, which displays two fragments side by side.

Whatever do you put for example in FragmentA.java then?

Java - Thread.wait in the main method," I'm reviewing Java code that essentially is a recurring process that moves/reads/parses some files on regular basis and outputs data into the database. The repeating part is done (roughly) as follows: My recommendation was to refactor code to Create instance of Collector and refactor static execute() method to the instance methodTo use Runnable or TimerTask to handle invocationsMy argument was that using Thread.wait from the main method and combining it with static access is not a good way of handling repeatable process especially doing file IO. To which the author replied (quoting) The description of Runnable says ""should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread"". In fact, I am intentionally avoiding threads in this program, for reasons of cost vrs.performance requirements.Here's another quote from same discussion which will hopefully help to clarify the author's position Technically, Java isn't executed at all, it is interpreted by the JVM which then executes machine instructions, to simulate that the Java code is executing. So it's really the JVM that is executing on a thread, or multiple threads. But as a Java code writer, I don't care. If I don't create ""threads"" in Java, then It's the job of the JVM to appear as if there are no threads even if the JVM is using threads ""under the covers"". A Java Pause is not executed, it is simulated by a sequence of machine instructions that may or may not call an OS 'wait'. (It probably does, because the JVM would not want to spin, burning CPU cycles, but that's a JVM implementation choice).So I have 2 questions:Is putting Thread.wait into the main method legit, safe and advisable way of doing repeatable task in this instance? And if not, why not since there's only one (main) thread of execution?What are the pitfals of using static metods in this context (if any)?I'll be happy to provide additional info if you have any other questions. <code>  public class CollectorMain { public static boolean signalRecieved = false; public static void main(String[] args) { Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() { public void run() { shutdown(); }}); while(!signalRecieved) { Collector.execute(); try { Thread.sleep(60 * 1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { break; } } // some shutdown logic } public static void shutdown() { signalReceived = true; }}public class Collector() { public static void execute() { // Move files from the queue dir to temp location // Read, parse files and insert records into database. // Then delete the processed files }}",Java - Thread.sleep in the main method

Java: What is the correct way to handle a situation where a method does not return," I use the OpenOffice API from my Java Program to handle Documents for me. Sometimes (once every 100k or so calls) the dispose method of a Document does not return, the CPU load stays at 100% but nothing seems to happen.How should I act / code correctly in this situation?My current approach is to wait for the dispose to succeed for two seconds. If it does not I try to terminate OpenOffice through the appropriate API. If that fails as well (as I would expect) then I kill the soffice process with a call to and then call to the Thread that initially tries to dispose the XComponent. Now the Java API says that Thread.stop() should not be used (and there are valid arguments to that) so I'm wondering if there are any better solutions that what I did. <code>  XDesktop xDesk = (...) // achive desktopxDesk.terminate();Runtime.getRuntime().exec(""pkill soffice""); // ""taskkill /IM soffice"" on windows disposeThread.stop();",Java: Method does not return.

Good pattern for create files," In one app, I have a task to create files that will be used by a third party.

As I mentioned its un-avoidable for me to make 6 http calls for which I do using 6 Async Tasks. As I get each one of the Async task response I will refresh the UI with new data.Its a bad UI experience if I refresh the UI 6 times in a very short period of time.Its give a flickering effect to my UI which is not desired.My Question:How can I hold-off from refreshing the UI until I get all the 6 Async Task responses? I understand each task is independent of each other. Should I run a while loop and wait until I get all the responses?Is there a better way to do this rather than a while loop because if any one of the call doesn't respond then I will stuck waiting forever.Note: I guess Android 1.6+ do execute Async tasks in parallel.This is more of a design question and I would appreciate any help on this.Thanks in advance <code> ,How to manage multiple Async Tasks efficiently in Android

JSTL empty operator," I am having a problem with JSTL and empty operator. I already made few simple pages and everything worked fine, but now I have: now no matter if I set the records attribute or not, the delete button shows up: in normal situation to records attribute I pass ArrayList and then use foreach, but sometimes ArrayList is empty, so in those situations I don't want delete button to show up, I fought that easiest way to achieve this would be to use this empty operator. Where am I making a mistake?I even tried to manually set this attribute to null: EDIT:@Qwe: yes you are right, it worked for me before because I tested if attribute was empty in my way, it was always true, because I used wrong construct, but it worked because I just wanted to show one string, if there was no String nothing showed up so I was thinking that everything worked fine. <code>  <%@ page language=""java"" contentType=""text/html; charset=UTF-8"" pageEncoding=""UTF-8""%> <%@taglib prefix=""c"" uri=""http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core""%> <html>","<c:if test='${not empty ""${records}""}'> never evaluates false"
Java 7 Automatic Resource Management JDBC," How to integrate the common JDBC idiom of creating/receiving a connection, querying the database and possibly processing the results with Java 7's automatic resource management, the try-with-resources statement? (Tutorial)Before Java 7, the usual pattern was something like this: With Java 7 you can go for: This will close the Connection and the PreparedStatement, but what about the rollback? I cannot add a catch clause containing the rollback, because the connection is only available within the try block.Do you still define the connection outside of the try block? What is the best practice here, especially if connection pooling is used? <code>  Connection con = null;PreparedStatement prep = null;try{ con = getConnection(); prep = prep.prepareStatement(""Update ...""); ... con.commit();}catch (SQLException e){ con.rollback(); throw e;}finally{ if (prep != null) prep.close(); if (con != null) con.close();} try(Connection con = getConnection(); PreparedStatement prep = con.prepareConnection(""Update ...""){ ... con.commit();}",Java 7 Automatic Resource Management JDBC (try-with-resources statement)

What's the best way to start Java applications on Windows?," RequirementsI want to publish a Java GUI application on Windows 7. This application is using the Swing Toolkit and doesn't need any native code. The application is installed using an NSIS installer. I want to integrate this application into Windows 7 as good as possible. This means:When the application is running it must be possible to pin the application to the taskbar.It must be possible to associate data files with the application so Windows opens these files with my application.Must automatically work with the 32 bit Java Runtime and with the 64 bit Java runtime. So when the user uninstalls a 32 bit Java and installs a 64 bit Java instead (Or vice-versa) then my application must still work.Must support large fonts setting of Windows. I don't really understand this feature. I just know that some applications ignore it completely, others (Like Google Chrome) are pixel-scaled (Looks really ugly) and others support it by simply using larger fonts as intended (That's what I want and normally it works. Only the WinRun4J solution mentioned below doesn't work with it).Tested solutionsWinRun4JWinRun4j is an EXE file which launches the Java application. Because the application doesn't fork a new Java process Windows thinks the EXE file IS the application. So there is no problem with the taskbar. File associations works because the files can be simply associated with the EXE file.Problems:Doesn't support large fonts. Application window is pixel-scaled instead (Like Google Chrome).Two different EXE files must be used depending on the installed JRE. So when the 64 bit JRE is installed then the application must be started with the 64 Bit EXE file. When 32 bit JRE ins installed then the other EXE must be used. This isn't user-friendly because the user doesn't understand why he must use the 32 bit EXE on a 64 bit operating system when only a 32 bit JRE is installed.Launch4JLaunch4J creates a 32 bit EXE which launches an external Java process to start the Java application. So unlike WinRun4J it can also start a 64 bit Java.Problems:Can't pin the application to the taskbar.System.out.println will not print to console if headerType=""gui"", regardless if application is started from console.JAROn Windows you can simply double click the JAR file to start the application. Installed JRE doesn't matter, simply works. But...Problems:Application can't be pinned to the taskbar.Can't create a shortcut in the start menu.Can't associate files with a JAR file.BAT/CMDA simple batch file like this can be used to start the application: A shortcut can be created for this batch file to set a custom icon.Problems:A DOS window pops up when the application is started.The batch file doesn't know where javaw.exe is located. Depending on which java version (32 or 64 bit) is installed it may be located in c:\windows\syswow64 instead and Windows doesn't redirect this call from batch files automatically. Using the JAVA_HOME environment variable is also a no-go because Java doesn't set this automatically.When associating files with the batch file then no custom icon can be set.Taskbar support isn't working properly. Application can be pinned to it when the batch file is started manually but when double clicking an associated file instead then it doesn' work.ShortcutInstead of using a batch file it is possible to only create a shortcut to start the application. It links to this command: c:\windows\system32\javaw.exe -jar ""c:\program files\myapp\myapp.jar"". Windows automatically redirects this call to the SysWOW64 directory if a 32 bit Java JRE is installed.Problems:Not possible to associate files with it because Windows only accepts EXE/COM/PIF/BAT/CMD files as association targets. LNK files don't work.QuestionIs there another solution which fulfills all the requirements from above? Or are there any tricks to solve the problems with the mentioned solutions? SolutionAfter solving the taskbar-pinning problem using Launch4j looks like the best solution. Launch4j can easily be integrated into a Maven project (With this or this plugin), configuration is pretty easy and everything works out of the box except taskbar pinning. For taskbar-pinning the Java application must set an appModelUserId as explained in the answer to this question.Additionally the Java application must be installed by an installer which must at least install one shortcut pointing to the EXE. This shortcut must also contain the appModelUserId. With NSIS this can be done with the WinShell plugin and a configuration like this: For some unknown reason this shortcut only has to exist. You don't have to use it. You can double-click the EXE and taskbar-pinning still works. You can even create the shortcut in some subfolder of your application folder. Taskbar-pinning stops working when the last shortcut of the EXE file is removed. <code>  @echo offstart c:\windows\system32\javaw.exe -jar ""c:\program files\myapp\myapp.jar"" %1 CreateShortCut ""$SMPROGRAMS\MyApp.lnk"" \ ""$INSTDIR\myapp.exe"" """" ""$INSTDIR\myapp.exe"" 0 SW_SHOWNORMALWinShell::SetLnkAUMI ""$SMPrograms\MyApp.lnk"" ""MyAppModelUserId""",What's the best way to start Java applications on Windows 7?

Mockito - Feeling that I don't use it's full potential," When using Mockito, I only use it to mock out dependencies, i.e. my workflow looks mostly like this:I have a class with dependencies: In my test class, I mock out those dependencies, and tell them which values to return when some specified methods are called: (I hope this example is not too simple or too derived ;-)). This works fine, it allows me to test classes (here: C) in isolation. Still, I never use Mockito's verify methods or any other of its features.

tomcat wouldnot start," My web project was working perfectly, it includes: spring3 and hibernate3. After renaming some packages in eclipse by the help of eclipse refactoring, tomcat could't start anymore. It hangs on these logs below: It hangs here, and when tomcat's ""start timeout"" reaches tomcat stops. I increased the timeout to 100 seconds, but it was useless, where the app still hanged on the longest times!The strangest thing is that there is no error whatsoever, it just hangs. I tried a lot of times cleaning/deleting the server and cleaning/building the project, but with no result.EDIT:Before refactoring the log continued like this below: EDIT:I got a thread dump with the following output: I can conclude the following:It's always the same spring hashmap in a singleton mode trying to fetch a bean and isn't able to find it for that reason the thread is locked ...very very strange! mustn't there be a throw for an exception or a timeout? weird Spring architecture!  <code>  ..................2012-02-29 08:57:04,552 INFO [org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean] [buildSessionFactory] -

How to clone() StringBiulder," Is there some ways how I could clone StringBuilder ? I am reading files by bits then convert these bits to ASCII chars after that I collect chars into String builder and when I have for example 8 chars I put that String Builder object into Array List. Then I clean it and again do the same. However I can't create new string builder because of memory and I can't do changes to that String builder because in Array List also that builder changes.So I think I have to clone that String Builder and put it into Array List. There is just one problem String Builder don't have clone(). So what is my alternatives ?Maybe someone could give some ideas what is neat way to do this considering about performance and memory.ArrayList characters = new ArrayList(); int counter = 0; <code>  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(blockSize-1);while (mbb.hasRemaining()) { char charAscii = (char)mbb.get(); counter++; charCounter++; if (counter == blockSize){ sb.append(charAscii); characters.add(sb);//sb.toString() sb.delete(0, sb.length()); counter = 0; }else{ sb.append(charAscii); } if(!mbb.hasRemaining()){ characters.add(sb);}}fc.close();return characters;",How to clone() StringBuilder

Complex JToggleButton oder JLayeredPane," I need to have a JToggleButton (that has custom background) that contains a JPanel with several JLabels within itself. That part works.

is there a way to detect if Bluetooth is turning on? (not if it's on already)," I have an app with a button on it that I use to turn BT on and off. I have the following code in there; I'm calling button Flip, which flips the BT state, and then calls ButtonText, which should update the UI. However, the issue I'm having is, it takes a few seconds for BT to turn on - and during these seconds, the BT status is not enabled, making my button say Bluetooth off, even if it will be on in 2 seconds.I found the STATE_CONNECTING constant in the BluetoothAdapter android documentation, but... I simply don't know how to use it, being a newbie and all.So, I've got two questions:Is there a way to dynamically tie a UI element (such as a button or image) to a BT state, so that when the BT state changes, the button will change as well?Otherwise, I would want to press the button and get the correct state (I would like for it to say BT on, even if it's only connecting, since it will be on in 2 seconds).

is it safe to use the first element of the array retuned by split?," I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, but I just want to confirm that there is never a situation where a non null string (regardless of what it contains) would return anything but a valid String as the first member of the array returned by split.

Recursive traversal of an n-dimensional space," I'm trying to write an algorithm that will let me iterate over all desired points within an n-dimensional space to find the minimum of a function f(x) where x is a vector of size n.Obviously, searching a 2-d or 3-d space is fairly straightforward, you can simply do: Unfortunately, for my problem, the dimensionality of the space is not fixed (I'm writing a generalised minimum finder for many functions in a statistical program) and so I'd have to write loops for each value of n I want to use - which might ultimately be rather large.I've been trying to get my head around how I could do this using recursion but can't quite see the solution - although I'm sure there is one there.The solution doesn't have to be recursive, but it must be general and efficient (the inner most line in that nested loop is going to get called an awful lot...).The way I'm representing the volume to search is a 2d array of double: This would represent a 4d space with the minimum and maximum bound in each dimension in position 0 or 1 of the array, respectively. Eg: Any ideas? <code>  for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) { for(int j = 0; j < y; j++) { //and so on for however many dimensions you want double[][] space = new double[2][4]; dim 0 1 2 3 min(0):-10 5 10 -0.5 max(1): 10 55 99 0.2",Traversal of an n-dimensional space
How to do Java String matching using Boolean Search Syntaxe?," I'm looking for a Java/Scala library that can take an user query and a text and returns if there was a matching or not.I'm processing a stream of information, ie: Twitter Stream, and can't afford to use a batching process, I need to evaluate each tweet in realtime, instead of index it through Lucene RAMDisk and querying it later.It's possible create a parser/lexer using ANTLR but this is such common usage that I can't believe nobody create a lib before.Some samples from TextQuery Ruby library that does exactly what I need: Once it was implemented in Ruby it's not suitable for my platform, also I can't use JRuby just for this point on our solution:I found a similar question but couldn't get answer from it:Boolean Query / Expression to a Concrete syntax treeThanks! <code>  TextQuery.new(""'to be' OR NOT 'to_be'"").match?(""to be"") # => true TextQuery.new(""-test"").match?(""some string of text"") # => true TextQuery.new(""NOT test"").match?(""some string of text"") # => true TextQuery.new(""a AND b"").match?(""b a"") # => true TextQuery.new(""a AND b"").match?(""a c"") # => false q = TextQuery.new(""a AND (b AND NOT (c OR d))"") q.match?(""d a b"") # => false q.match?(""b"") # => false q.match?(""a b cdefg"") # => true TextQuery.new(""a~"").match?(""adf"") # => true TextQuery.new(""~a"").match?(""dfa"") # => true TextQuery.new(""~a~"").match?(""daf"") # => true TextQuery.new(""2~a~1"").match?(""edaf"") # => true TextQuery.new(""2~a~2"").match?(""edaf"") # => false TextQuery.new(""a"", :ignorecase => true).match?(""A b cD"") # => true",How to do Java String matching using Boolean Search Syntax?

Java: How to draw overlay that doesn't move over ScrolllPane Viewport?," I'd like to use a ScrollPane to display an image in its Viewport, and also have a grid (or box, or any other type of registration/location marker) overlay on the image. I need the overlay to remain fixed when scrolling (meaning the image seems to move ""under"" the overlay). I will be scrolling the View in the Viewport at a fixed rate to provide a smooth motion, and the overlay is to provide a reference to a certain location within the Viewport. Conceptually, think of a large map scrolling in a Viewport, and the Viewport having a rectangle that does not move (relative to the Viewport itself) that marks a region that can be zoomed into based on some user action.I presume (but have not yet confirmed) that the ScrollPane implementation handles rendering of the View efficiently (from backing store, not having to repaint the entire View (or even ViewPort) for each new partial exposure) and so would prefer not to have to Override the paint() method.I've looked at LayerPane, and while not having mastered it, it seems that this is a brute force approach. The ScrollPane is one Component of a SplitPane and will be moved/resized. I expect that I'd have to manually maintain the correct relationship between the ViewPort and the LayerPane using absolute positioning. I'm far from an expert in GUI design & implementation and I'm sure I'm missing possibilities ranging from obvious to obscure and elegant that an experienced person would know.I'm open to any suggestions, not just the path I've started down. Should I (can I) add a JPanel as one component in my SplitPane, then add a LayerPane to that containing my ScrollPane and the overlay (another JPanel) on different layers on the LayerPane? Is there functionality in ScrollPane to support this directly? I've looked at the Java Swing Tutorials and the API documentation but haven't seen anything yet.Thanks.UPDATE:Thanks for the link, trashgod. This was much easier than I had expected. No need for LayerPane, GlassPane, xor-based compositing... I don't know why it didn't occur to me to try overriding JViewport.paint() to draw my overlay - but with the code below I validated the concept will give me what I'm looking for. Just use the subclass of JViewport and it does what I wanted (in this case overlaying a rectangle in the center of the Viewport while the image scrolls underneath). I'm no GUI expert, and the Java API is incredibly wide; I have no idea how you guys keep this all in your head - but thanks! <code>  class MyViewport extends JViewport { @Override public void paint(Graphics g) { super.paint(g); Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g; g2.setPaint(Color.BLACK); g2.drawRect(getWidth()/4,getHeight()/4,getWidth()/2,getHeight()/2); }}",Java: How to draw non-scrolling overlay over ScrollPane Viewport?

Anti-hack solution for a private string key?," I need to store a private string key inside of the app. Its value will never change and is set manually in code. I cannot obviously just store it as a String as reverse-engineering method would reveal it, even with obfuscation applied. How do you suggest I protect this private key?I though of saving it into a database, but a database can be pulled out of the phone as well.PS. this key is a special parameter so an important method and it's crucial it stays unknown to anyone! It's not a decrypting key. This string will be used as a parameter to encryption method (md5 or similar) and then a result will be sent to our Internet service. EDITSorry, for making it so complicated. I thought I could get an answer with as few info as possible. This app will allow users to send some text to an Internet service which then posts that text to a web site. We need to make sure that the text is sent via Android phone as any web robot script can mimic android phone and post a spam. As captcha-like methods are not welcome on mobile phones, there will be a secret key which will be put through md5 (with some other things) to generate a hash code. This hash will be sent to an Internet service. The Internet service will use the same key to get a md5 result and then compare it to see if the sender is a mobile phone or some robot. This is really the max I am allowed to say. I hope it is enough.  <code> ",Anti-hack solution for a secret key in Android app?

"Java Mail ""no login methods supported"""," I am trying to implement a Java Mail servlet, first step is connecting to the IMAP server.I am able to telnet to the server on port 143 (default IMAP port), telnet says: OK The Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 service is ready.Now I am trying to connect to the server using the Java Mail API like this: And I am able to connect to this same server using an existing Outlook Webapp with the same credentials I am trying to pass to it in java.But running this with session.setDebug(true) produces the following output: EDIT:I added prop.setProperty(""mail.imap.starttls.enable"", ""true"") as suggested.However, I started getting this debug output: Assuming that this was a certificate problem I followed these instructions and added mail server to my cacerts file. The test program included there ran totally fine and I could connect using an SSL url but I still got the same exception when running the java mail class.I also tried changing to ""imaps"" with: session.getStore(""imaps"") (instead of ""imap"") and wasn't even able to get the ""Microsoft Exchange Server is now ready"" message. I think because it is trying to connect on port 993 whenever ""imaps"" was specified. But using telnet to port 993 does not show any connection to the email server.So next I tried to force the program to use SSL on port 143 like this: Only to receive this exception, so I don't think it wants anything to do with SSL: Could that TLS exception above (DEBUG IMAP: STARTTLS Exception: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException:) come from TLS not being enabled on the Exchange Server?I don't have ready access to the e-mail server but I could probably get someone to let me in. SOLUTION:HulkingUnicorn's comment below his answer pointed out this answer which was the exact handling needed. Apparently MS Exchange Server has this problem. Along with adding the class listed in that answer to my package, I simply implemented my mail connections like this and all was well: <code>  Properties props = new Properties();session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, null);store = session.getStore(""imap"");store.connect(""host"",""user"",""password""); DEBUG: setDebug: JavaMail version 1.4.5DEBUG: getProvider() returning javax.mail.Provider[STORE,imap,com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPStore,Sun Microsystems, Inc]DEBUG: mail.imap.fetchsize: 16384DEBUG: mail.imap.statuscachetimeout: 1000DEBUG: mail.imap.appendbuffersize: -1DEBUG: mail.imap.minidletime: 10DEBUG: trying to connect to host ""myHost"", port 143, isSSL false* OK The Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 service is ready.A0 CAPABILITY* CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 LOGINDISABLED STARTTLS UIDPLUS CHILDREN IDLE NAMESPACE LITERAL+A0 OK CAPABILITY completed.DEBUG: protocolConnect login, host=myHost, user=myUser, password=<non-null>javax.mail.MessagingException: No login methods supported!; DEBUG: setDebug: JavaMail version 1.4.5DEBUG: getProvider() returning javax.mail.Provider[STORE,imap,com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPStore,Sun Microsystems, Inc]DEBUG: mail.imap.fetchsize: 16384DEBUG: mail.imap.statuscachetimeout: 1000DEBUG: mail.imap.appendbuffersize: -1DEBUG: mail.imap.minidletime: 10DEBUG: enable STARTTLSDEBUG: trying to connect to host ""myHost"", port 143, isSSL false* OK The Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 service is ready.A0 CAPABILITY* CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 LOGINDISABLED STARTTLS UIDPLUS CHILDREN IDLE NAMESPACE LITERAL+A0 OK CAPABILITY completed.DEBUG: protocolConnect login, host=myHost, user=myUser, password=<non-null>A1 STARTTLSA1 OK Begin TLS negotiation now.DEBUG IMAP: STARTTLS Exception: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target // Use SSLprop.setProperty(""mail.imap.socketFactory.class"", ""javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory"");prop.setProperty(""mail.imap.socketFactory.fallback"", ""false"");// Use port 143prop.setProperty(""mail.imap.port"", ""143"");prop.setProperty(""mail.imap.socketFactory.port"", ""143""); DEBUG: mail.imap.fetchsize: 16384DEBUG: mail.imap.statuscachetimeout: 1000DEBUG: mail.imap.appendbuffersize: -1DEBUG: mail.imap.minidletime: 10DEBUG: trying to connect to host ""myHost"", port 143, isSSL falseNot able to process the mail reading.javax.mail.MessagingException: Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection?; Properties prop = new Properties();prop.setProperty(""mail.imap.starttls.enable"", ""true"");prop.setProperty(""ssl.SocketFactory.provider"", ""my.package.name.ExchangeSSLSocketFactory"");prop.setProperty(""mail.imap.socketFactory.class"", ""my.package.name.ExchangeSSLSocketFactory"");session = Session.getDefaultInstance(prop, null);session.setDebug(true);store = session.getStore(""imap"");store.connect(""myHost"",""myUser"",""myPassword"");","Java Mail to Exchange Server ""no login methods supported"""
"PMD rules confiction:A method should have only one exit point, and that should be the last statement in the method"," sometimes I found that a few PMD rules conflict with each other, therefore you can not write code that satisfies all PMD rules.

Run .exe file from Java from file location," I have to open a .exe file from my Java program. So I tried following code First. But I was getting some error. Then I found out that the exe has to be launched from that location that is c://program files/test/ only then it will open with out errors. So I decided to write a .bat file and execute so that it will cd to that location and execute the .exe file. Following is my code: The above code works perfectly. However, the command prompt is also opened at the back of my .exe (Application). It closes only after the .exe file exits..I need to clse my command prompt when my application stats.My .bat file will be like following after it is written by the program. <code>  Process process = runtime.exec(""c:\\program files\\test\\test.exe""); BufferedWriter fileOut;String itsFileLocation = ""c:\\program files\\test\\"" System.out.println(itsFileLocation); try { fileOut = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(""C:\\test.bat"")); fileOut.write(""cd\\""+""\n""); fileOut.write(""cd ""+ itsFileLocation +""\n""); fileOut.write(""test.exe""+""\n""); fileOut.write(""exit""+""\n""); fileOut.close(); // Close the output stream after all output is done. } catch (IOException e1) { e1.printStackTrace(); } // Create the Buffered Writer object to write to a file called filename.txt Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime(); try { Process process =runtime.exec(""cmd /c start C:\\test.bat""); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } cd\cd C:\Program Files\test\test.exeexit",Run .exe file in Java from file location

"Is there any ""threshold"" justifying multithreading computation?"," So basically I needed to optimize this piece of code today. It tries to find the longest sequence produced by some function for the first million starting numbers: My mistake was to try to introduce multithreading: Unfortunately, the multithreaded version worked 5 times slower than the single-threaded on 4 processors (cores).Then I tried a bit more crude approach: and it worked much faster, but still it was slower than the single thread approach.I hope it's not because I screwed up the way I'm doing multithreading, but rather this particular calculation/algorithm is not a good fit for parallel computation. If I change calculation to make it more processor intensive by replacing method next with: both multithreaded versions start to execute more than twice as fast than the singlethreaded version on a 4 core machine.So clearly there must be some threshold that you can use to determine if it is worth to introduce multithreading and my question is: What is the basic rule that would help decide if a given calculation is intensive enough to be optimized by running it in parallel (without spending effort to actually implement it?) <code>  public static void main(String[] args) { int mostLen = 0; int mostInt = 0; long currTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); for(int j=2; j<=1000000; j++) { long i = j; int len = 0; while((i=next(i)) != 1) { len++; } if(len > mostLen) { mostLen = len; mostInt = j; } } System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - currTime); System.out.println(""Most len is "" + mostLen + "" for "" + mostInt);}static long next(long i) { if(i%2==0) { return i/2; } else { return i*3+1; }} void doSearch() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException { final int numProc = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors(); System.out.println(""numProc = "" + numProc); ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numProc); long currTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); List<Future<ValueBean>> list = new ArrayList<Future<ValueBean>>(); for (int j = 2; j <= 1000000; j++) { MyCallable<ValueBean> worker = new MyCallable<ValueBean>(); worker.setBean(new ValueBean(j, 0)); Future<ValueBean> f = executor.submit(worker); list.add(f); } System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - currTime); int mostLen = 0; int mostInt = 0; for (Future<ValueBean> f : list) { final int len = f.get().getLen(); if (len > mostLen) { mostLen = len; mostInt = f.get().getNum(); } } executor.shutdown(); System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - currTime); System.out.println(""Most len is "" + mostLen + "" for "" + mostInt);}public class MyCallable<T> implements Callable<ValueBean> { public ValueBean bean; public void setBean(ValueBean bean) { this.bean = bean; } public ValueBean call() throws Exception { long i = bean.getNum(); int len = 0; while ((i = next(i)) != 1) { len++; } return new ValueBean(bean.getNum(), len); }}public class ValueBean { int num; int len; public ValueBean(int num, int len) { this.num = num; this.len = len; } public int getNum() { return num; } public int getLen() { return len; }}long next(long i) { if (i % 2 == 0) { return i / 2; } else { return i * 3 + 1; }} static int mostLen = 0;static int mostInt = 0;synchronized static void updateIfMore(int len, int intgr) { if (len > mostLen) { mostLen = len; mostInt = intgr; }}public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { long currTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); final int numProc = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors(); System.out.println(""numProc = "" + numProc); ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numProc); for (int i = 2; i <= 1000000; i++) { final int j = i; executor.execute(new Runnable() { public void run() { long l = j; int len = 0; while ((l = next(l)) != 1) { len++; } updateIfMore(len, j); } }); } executor.shutdown(); executor.awaitTermination(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS); System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - currTime); System.out.println(""Most len is "" + mostLen + "" for "" + mostInt);}static long next(long i) { if (i % 2 == 0) { return i / 2; } else { return i * 3 + 1; }} long next(long i) { Random r = new Random(); for(int j=0; j<10; j++) { r.nextLong(); } if (i % 2 == 0) { return i / 2; } else { return i * 3 + 1; }}","Is there any ""threshold"" justifying multithreaded computation?"

Java outofmemoryerror when creating <100 threads," I've been reading and testing and banging my head on the wall for over a day because of this error. I have some Java code in a class called Listener that looks like this I have been tweaking the JVM settings -Xmx (anywhere from 1 to 15G) and -Xss (anywhere from 104k to 512M). The server has 24 GB of RAM, but must also run the database that supports the program.After 2-20 threads are created (a few dozen exist elsewhere in the program as well), I get the error $java -version yields: There is always a large amount of free memory on the system when this happens, and other programs continue to execute fine. What is causing Java to think it has no more memory for new threads?UPDATE:Perhaps this is bigger than I thought- I managed to get this error (only one time) when I used ^C: and the same happened when I tried to kill the client (also written in Java and running on the same server, it is a single thread that reads a file and sends it to the server over the socket), so there is definitely a limit beyond the JVM causing one to interfere with the other, but I can't imagine what if I still have free memory and am not using swap at all? Server -Xmx1G -Xss104k Client -Xmx10MUPDATE2:Abandoning the perl Forks::Super library and running the clients from bash let me get up to 34 threads before the server crashed with OOME, so running multiple clients definitely had an impact on the server, but at the same time I should still be able to run more than 34 (68 if one counts the clients) java threads at a time. Which system resources are blocking the creation of more threads (i.e. where should I look to find the hog)?

AES encryption cuts off text," I am trying to read from a file and encrypt the data using AES in CFB mode with no padding 'AES/CFB/NoPadding'. The IV is 16bytes long.Given that AES by default, works with 16 byte blocks, I would have thought of using a padding scheme if I were using CBC or any other mode but CFB. CFB essentially requires no padding for plaintext.So the problem is that if my file contains data which is less than 16 bytes, then nothing gets encrypted. If it is greater than 16 bytes, then only the first 16 bytes get encrypted.This clearly indicates that the block size is kicking in and if there is an underflow or overflow of bytes w.r.t. the block size, then that data/bytes are discarded.What I don't understand is while using CFB, I need not pad the data.. right! Then why is the 16byte default block size of AES coming into action and truncating data? <code> ",AES encryption cuts off text in CFB mode

Run a java application as a service on linux," I have written a Java server application that runs on a standard virtual hosted Linux solution. The application runs all the time listening for socket connections and creating new handlers for them. It is a server side implementation to a client-server application.The way I start it is by including it in the start up rc.local script of the server. However once started I do not know how to access it to stop it and if I want to install an update, so I have to restart the server in order to restart the application.On a windows PC, for this type of application I might create a windows service and then I can stop and start it as I want. Is there anything like that on a Linux box so that if I start this application I can stop it and restart it without doing a complete restart of the server.My application is called WebServer.exe. It is started on server startup by including it in my rc.local as such: I am a bit of a noob at Linux so any example would be appreciated with any posts. However I do have SSH, and full FTP access to the box to install any updates as well as access to a Plesk panel. <code>  java -jar /var/www/vhosts/myweb.com/phpserv/WebServer.jar &",Run a Java Application as a Service on Linux
Handling InterruptedException while waiting for an exit signal," I've come across the code below, and I'm wondering if it does exactly what I think it does: About the context: there is another thread that checks for mShouldExit (inside the sObject monitor) and will exit in that case.This does not look to be a correct pattern to me. If an interrupt happens, it will set the interrupted status again, so when it returns to sObject.wait(), another InterruptedException will come etc. etc. etc. Therefore, it can never go to truly waiting state (sObject.wait()) i.e. it will never release the sObject monitor. This may result in an infinite loop, as the other thread cannot set mExiting to true, because it can never enter sObject's monitor. (So I think that the interrupt() call is an error, it must not be used here.) Am I missing something?Note that the code snippet is a part of the official Android framework source code.UPDATE: actually, the situation is worse, because the same pattern is used in Android when your GL rendering starts. The official source code of GLSurfaceView.GLThread.surfaceCreated(): You can reproduce the bug in a similar way: make sure your UI thread has its interrupted status flag yet, then add your GLSurfaceView and start the GL rendering (via setRenderer(...), but on some devices, make sure your GLSurfaceView has Visibility.VISIBLE status, otherwise rendering will not start).If you follow the above steps, your UI thread will end up in an infinite loop, because the above-quoted code will keep generating an InterruptedException (due to wait()) and therefore the GL thread will never be able to set mWaitingForSurface to false.According to my tests, it seems that such an infinite loop will also result in an endless sequence of GC_CONCURRENT garbage collection (or, at least, such messages in logcat). Interesting, someone had an unknown poorly-defined issue on stackoverflow earlier which might be related:How to solve GC_concurrent freed?Isn't it possible that perhaps his UI thread had its interrupted flag set to true, and he was using a GLSurfaceView for the map he mentions? Just an assumption, a possible scenario. <code>  synchronized(sObject) { mShouldExit = true; sObject.notifyAll() while (!mExited) { try { sObject.wait(); } catch (InterruptedException ex) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); } }} public void surfaceCreated() { synchronized(sGLThreadManager) { if (LOG_THREADS) { Log.i(""GLThread"", ""surfaceCreated tid="" + getId()); } mHasSurface = true; sGLThreadManager.notifyAll(); while((mWaitingForSurface) && (!mExited)) { try { sGLThreadManager.wait(); } catch (InterruptedException e) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); } } } }",Handling InterruptedException while waiting for an exit signal (bug in Android?)

Virtual trackball implementation in JOGL," I've been trying for the past few days to make a working implementation of a virtual trackball for the user interface for a 3D graphing-like program. But I'm having trouble.Looking at the numbers and many tests the problems seems to be the actual concatenation of my quaternions but I don't know or think so. I've never worked with quaternions or virtual trackballs before, this is all new to me. I'm using the Quaternion class supplied by JOGL. I tried making my own and it worked (or at least as far a I know) but it was a complete mess so I just went with JOGL's.When I do not concatenate the quaternions the slight rotations I see seem to be what I want, but of course It's hard when it's only moving a little bit in any direction. This code is based off of the Trackball Tutorial on the OpenGL wiki.When I use the Quaternion class's mult (Quaternion q) method the graph hardly moves (even less than not trying to concatenate the quaternions).When I tried Quaternionclass'sadd (Quaternion q)` method for the fun of it I get something that at the very least rotates the graph but not in any coherent way. It spazzes out and rotates randomly as I move the mouse. Occasionally I'll get quaternions entirely filled with NaN.In my code I will not show either of these, I'm lost with what to do with my quaternions. I know I want to multiply them because as far as I'm aware that's how they are concatenated. But like I said I've had no success, I'm assuming the screw up is somewhere else in my code.Anyway, my setup has a Trackball class with a public Point3f projectMouse (int x, int y) method and a public void rotateFor (Point3f p1, Point3f p2), Where Point3f is a class I made. Another class called Camera has a public void transform (GLAutoDrawable g) method which will call OpenGL methods to rotate based on the trackball's quaternion.Here's the code: Here's the rotation method: EDIT:I'm getting closer, I found out a few simple mistakes.1: The JOGL implementation treats W as the real number, not X, I was using X for real2: I was not starting with the quaternion 1 + 0i + 0j + 0k3: I was not converting the quaternion into an axis/angle for opengl4: I was not converting the angle into degrees for openglAlso as Markus pointed out I was not normalizing the normal, when I did I couldn't see much change, thought it's hard to tell, he's right though.The problem now is when I do the whole thing the graph shakes with a fierceness like you would never believe. It (kinda) moves in the direction you want it to, but the seizures are too fierce to make anything out of it.Here's my new code with a few name changes: Here's the OpenGL code: The reason for the name changes is because I deleted everything in the Trackball class and started over. Probably not the greatest idea, but oh well.EDIT2:I can say with pretty good certainty that there is nothing wrong with projecting onto the sphere.I can also say that as far as the whole thing goes it seems to be the VECTOR that is the problem. The angle looks just fine, but the vector seems to jump around.EDIT3:The problem is the multiplication of the two quaternions, I can confirm that everything else works as expected. Something goes whacky with the axis during multiplication! <code>  public Point3f projectMouse (int x, int y){ int off = Screen.WIDTH / 2; // Half the width of the GLCanvas x = x - objx_ - off; // obj being the 2D center of the graph y = off - objy_ - y; float t = Util.sq(x) + Util.sq(y); // Util is a class I made with float rsq = Util.sq(off); // simple some math stuff // off is also the radius of the sphere float z; if (t >= rsq) z = (rsq / 2.0F) / Util.sqrt(t); else z = Util.sqrt(rsq - t); Point3f result = new Point3f (x, y, z); return result;} public void rotateFor (Point3f p1, Point3f p2){ // Vector3f is a class I made, I already know it works // all methods in Vector3f modify the object's numbers // and return the new modify instance of itself Vector3f v1 = new Vector3f(p1.x, p1.y, p1.z).normalize(); Vector3f v2 = new Vector3f(p2.x, p2.y, p2.z).normalize(); Vector3f n = v1.copy().cross(v2); float theta = (float) Math.acos(v1.dot(v2)); float real = (float) Math.cos(theta / 2.0F); n.multiply((float) Math.sin(theta / 2.0F)); Quaternion q = new Quaternion(real, n.x, n.y, n.z); rotation = q; // A member that can be accessed by a getter // Do magic on the quaternion} public void rotate (Vector3f v1, Vector3f v2){ Vector3f v1p = v1.copy().normalize(); Vector3f v2p = v2.copy().normalize(); Vector3f n = v1p.copy().cross(v2p); if (n.length() == 0) return; // Sometimes v1p equals v2p float w = (float) Math.acos(v1p.dot(v2p)); n.normalize().multiply((float) Math.sin(w / 2.0F)); w = (float) Math.cos(w / 2.0F); Quaternion q = new Quaternion(n.x, n.y, n.z, w); q.mult(rot); rot_ = q;} Vector3f p1 = tb_.project(x1, y1); // projectMouse [changed name] Vector3f p2 = tb_.project(x2, y2); tb_.rotate (p1, p2); float[] q = tb_.getRotation().toAxis(); // Converts to angle/axis gl.glRotatef((float)Math.toDegrees(q[0]), q[1], q[2], q[3]);",Virtual trackball implementation

Is there a library (or a function) for morphing images in Java (or processing)?," I'm planning on writing software that morphs images to a certain shape (based on points and vectors that define similar regions in different images, and the calculation of an ""average"" shape).Obviously this is pretty difficult, and therefore I'm looking for a library that can handle the morphing of images (so I can focus on the GUI, and feeding the necessary coordinates to the library).To clarify, an example of what I want to do is:Load images (say, image 1 and 2)Define similar points in images (say, the tip of a nose in image 1 and 2, on coordinates (1,5) and (1,7))Calculate the average coordinates for the points (so that would be (1,6))Morph defined points on each image to the same coordinate (so morph all noses to (1,6))Save imagesNow of course the actual use case would be a lot more complex (instead of singular coordinates I would also like to morph lines and other shapes (vectors), but the principle would remain sort of the same. <code> ",Is there a library for morphing images in Java (or processing)?

Turning Flash on While Recording Video," I need a way to control the camera flash on an Android device while it is recording video. I'm making a strobe light app, and taking videos with a flashing strobe light would result in the ability to record objects that are moving at high speeds, like a fan blade.The flash can only be enabled by starting a video preview and setting FLASH_MODE_TORCH in the camera's parameters. That would look like this: Once the preview has started, I can flip that parameter back and forth to turn the light on and off. This works well until I try to record a video. The trouble is that in order to give the camera to the MediaRecorder, I first have to unlock it. After that unlock, I can no longer change the camera parameters and therefore have no way to change the flash state.I do not know if it is actually possible to do this since I'm not the best at java-hacking, but here is what I do know:Camera.unlock() is a native method, so I can't really see the mechanism behind the way it locks me outCamera.Parameter has a HashMap that contains all of its parametersCamera.setParameters(Parameters) takes the HashMap, converts it to a string, and passes it to a native methodI can eliminate all the parameters but TORCH-MODE from the HashMap and the Camera will still accept itSo, I can still access the Camera, but it won't listen to anything I tell it. (Which is kind of the purpose of Camera.unlock())Edit:After examining the native code, I can see that in CameraService.cpp my calls to Camera.setParameters(Parameters) get rejected because my Process ID does not match the Process ID the camera service has on record. So it would appear that that is my hurdle.Edit2:It would appear that the MediaPlayerService is the primary service that takes control of the camera when a video is recording. I do not know if it is possible, but if I could somehow start that service in my own process, I should be able to skip the Camera.unlock() call.Edit3:One last option would be if I could somehow get a pointer to the CameraHardwareInterface. From the looks of it, this is a device specific interface and probably does not include the PID checks. The main problem with this though is that the only place that I can find a pointer to it is in CameraService, and CameraService isn't talking.Edit4: (several months later)At this point, I don't think it is possible to do what I originally wanted. I don't want to delete the question on the off chance that someone does answer it, but I'm not actively seeking an answer. (Though, receiving a valid answer would be awesome.) <code>  Camera c = Camera.open();Camera.Parameters p = c.getParameters();p.setFlashMode(Camera.Parameters.FLASH_MODE_TORCH);c.setParameters(p);c.startPreview(); MediaRecorder m = new MediaRecorder();c.unlock(); // the killerm.setCamera(c);",Enabling Camera Flash While Recording Video

JFreeChart axes defined," Could somebody provide a simple explanation of the JFreeChart axis-types? First, we have the axes that are based on the class hierarchy (ValueAxis, CategoryAxis, lots of subclasses)We also have the ""domain axis"" versus ""range axis"" distinction (only for xy plots?). It is not entirely clear how these relate to the class-hierarchy-based axes. These are not classes but there are setDomainAxis and setRangeAxis methods in XYPlot.Visually I would think in horizontal and vertical axes, I am not sure how these are related to the previous concepts (is ""domain"" always horizontal?). I think that the x-axis is horizontal and the y-axis vertical, but I am not sure whether this is always the case with XYPlot.EDIT: I tried to study both the API docs and the developer guide. The API docs just give a hierarchy of classes, but it is not clear when and how to use them. The developer guide also gives no definition or explanation of ""domain axis"" and ""range axis"", it just uses these terms. I admit that the question is broad, it is because I could not find this basic information anywhere. I wanted to have a general understanding, but my most important question at the moment is what determines what gets to be on the horizontal/vertical axis (is ""domain"" always horizontal? if not how to set it?) because I am getting some crazy results and I don't know where to start the debugging. It is also not clear whether I should use CombinedRangeXYPlot or CombinedDomainXYPlot if I want the two plots to be placed one above the other.EDIT2: Although this was not answered, I found out in the meantime what determines whether the domain axis is horizontal: the PlotOrientation setting. This setting (on the level of combined plot) also determines whether CombinedRangeXYPlot/CombinedDomainXYPlot arrange the two plots horizontally or vertically. <code> ",JFreeChart domain/range axes defined

Joda Time Vs java.util.Date," Possible Duplicate: Should I use Java date and time classes or go with a 3rd party library like Joda Time? I could use some guidance about when it's worth using Joda Time rather than the basic java.util.Date class. What are the benefits? Does Joda Time let you do anything you can't do with the Date class, or is it just easier to work with or what?Also, I've seen conflicting info about whether Joda Time is part of the standard API. Is it standard or not? <code> ",Differences between java.util.Date and Joda Time APIs

Does this mean that Java Math.Floor is Extremely Slow?," I don't Java much.I am writing some optimized math code and I was shocked by my profiler results. My code collects values, interleaves the data and then chooses the values based on that. Java runs slower than my C++ and MATLAB implementations. I am using javac 1.7.0_05I am using the Sun/Oracle JDK 1.7.05There exists a floor function that performs a relevant task in the code. Does anybody know of the paradigmatic way to fix this?I noticed that my floor() function is defined with something called StrictMath. Is there something like -ffast-math for Java? I am expecting there must be a way to change the floor function to something more computationally reasonable without writing my own. EditSo a few people suggested I try to do a cast. I tried this and there was absolutely no change in walltime. 413742 cast floor function394675 Math.floorThese test were ran without the profiler. An effort was made to use a profiler but the runtime was drastically altered (15+ minutes so I quit). <code>  public static double floor(double a) { return StrictMath.floor(a); // default impl. delegates to StrictMath} private static int flur(float dF){ return (int) dF;}",Does this mean that Java Math.floor is extremely slow?
Java: Why outisde a method i can't do assignment?," If I try to assign a value to a variable in a class, but outside a method I get an error. but, if I initialize it during the creation, it works. Inside a method, it works in both cases. <code>  class one{ Integer b; b=Integer.valueOf(2);} class one{ Integer b=Integer.valueOf(2);}",Why can't I do assignment outside a method?
PortletSession is null," We use IBM WebSphere Portal in combination with JSF. A dreadful mix, which keeps proving its dreadfulness time after time.Recently we're having the issue where we have a portlet with a link to a download servlet (contained in the same war). This servlet tries to read certain attributes from the HttpSession which are supposed to be set by the portlet on the PortletSession in APPLICATION_SCOPE.Sometimes, however, the servlet couldn't read any of the needed attributes from the HttpSession. This was cause for an investigation by me. After some searching I discovered that it only happened when the portlet was loaded for the first time (without any page reloads).After some experimenting I got a NullPointerException when calling getAttributeNames(scope) on the PortletSession. The PortletSession was obtained from the external context through the faces context. I discovered the PortletSession was in fact a com.ibm.faces.portlet.httpbridge.PortletSessionWrapper which apparently is supposed to contain the actual PortletSession. This contained session was clearly null. Most methods of the PortletSessionWrapper guard against an NPE with a null check, however, the getAttributeNames(scope) didn't (a bug if you ask me). Now is the big question: why is the (real) PortletSession null on the first load of the portlet ?The META-INF of the jsf-protletbrdige providing the wrapper: Manifest-Version: 1.0 Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.7.1 Created-By: IBM Corporation Specification-Title: Java Server Faces Implementation-Title: JSF Widget Library (JWL) - Portlet Bridge Implementation-Version: JWL v3_1_5 Implementation-Vendor: IBM Build-Version: 20100212_0941 Build-Date: February 12 2010 Copyright-Info: Copyright (c) 2003,2008, International Business Machines Corporation.

how to terminate a thread in a view scoped bean," In our application when a user clicks on commandlink, a pop up is generated. This click will pass an id to process. My managed bean is viewscoped and I am creating a thread to do some tasks. In a scenario where a user clicks on the link a pop up is generated and the thread has started executing jobs, say the user closes the pop up and tries to click the link providing a different id this time. My problem is the previous thread which was started is not being destroyed. I can still get the latest id details as a response but the previous thread still executes jobs. I would like to know if there is a way to terminate the previous instance thread on a new request. I know I can achieve this using sessionscoped but popups are being opened in the same session.  <code> ",How to terminate a thread in a view scoped bean?
why abstract class why not interface?," For example a real estate builder is constructing an apartment with many flats. All the rooms in the flats have the same design, except the bedroom. The bedroom design is left for the people who would own the flats i.e; the bed Rooms can be of different designs for different flats.I can achieve this through an abstract class like below: An implementation class would be as follows: Alternatively I can use an interface instead of an abstract class to achieve the same purpose like follows: Now the question is : For this why should choose to use an interface (or) why should I choose to use an abstract class? <code>  public abstract class Flat{ //some properties public void livingRoom(){ //some code } public void kitchen(){ //some code } public abstract void bedRoom(); }} public class Flat101 extends Flat{ public void bedRoom() { System.out.println(""This flat has a customized bedroom""); } } class Flat{ public void livingRoom(){ System.out.println(""This flat has a living room""); } public void kitchen(){ System.out.println(""This flat has a kitchen""); } }interface BedRoomInterface{ public abstract void bedRoom();}public class Flat101 extends Flat implements BedRoomInterface{ public void bedRoom() { System.out.println(""This flat has a customized bedroom""); }}",Why use abstract class and not interface?

How to check for null value in java," In this code. We pass a null value to the function testFun. Compiles fine, but gives a NullPointerException in runtime, which I did not expect. Why is it throwing an exception, rather than evaluating the if condition to true and printing ""String is empty""?Suppose the value of the actual argument being passed to testFun is generated from some process. Assume that mistakenly a null value is returned by that process and is fed to testFun. If such is the case, how does one validate that the value passed to the function is null or not?One (weird) solution may be by assigning the formal parameter to some variable inside the function and then testing it. But if there are many variables passed to the function, that might become tedious and unfeasible. So, how does one check for null values in such a scenario? <code>  public class Test { public static void testFun(String str) { if (str == null | str.length() == 0) { System.out.println(""String is empty""); } else { System.out.println(""String is not empty""); } } public static void main(String [] args) { testFun(null); }}",if statement checks for null but still throws a NullPointerException

What GUI libraries are the jetbrains using?," BackgroundI am somewhat new to Java and am enjoying using IntelliJ IDE developed by the JetBrains team.I have downloaded the source for the Community Edition, and I am trying to work out what GUI libraries they are using to get the look-and-feel.QuestionWhat libraries (if any) are they using to get the non-native tabs, toolbars and breadcrumb component?The panels they are using are also interesting, however I get the feeling they were developed for the project and are not a library. Is this true?Can someone provide a breakdown of what is needed to produce a similar look-and-feel in a GUI project?Does anyone have tutorials for that?

how to assign a byte to string literally in Java," For example, the bits in a byte B are 10000010, how can I assign the bits to the string str literally, that is, str = ""10000010"".EditI read the byte from a binary file, and stored in the byte array B. I use System.out.println(Integer.toBinaryString(B[i])). the problem is(a) when the bits begin with (leftmost) 1, the output is not correct because it converts B[i] to a negative int value.(b) if the bits begin with 0, the output ignore 0, for example, assume B[0] has 00000001, the output is 1 instead of 00000001 <code> ",How to convert a byte to its binary string representation

"what does ""link with editor "" feature do in Eclipse?"," I'm new to Eclipse (and don't know NetBeans too). I'm reading eclipse tutorial. But I'm stacked and can't understand what ""Link with editor"" does exactly.It is said in Eclipse->Help: select the Link with Editor button in the local toolbar or view menu of one of the navigation views. Lastly, click on the editor tab for JanesFile.txt. Notice how the navigation view updated itself to select the file you are currently editing (JanesFile.txt). If you don't like this automatic update you can easily turn it off by deselecting Link with Editor.I select the Link with Editor button but i can't see any change It looks that it doesn't do any visible thing. It said in another documentation of Eclipse : When multiple editors are opened, it can be difficult to keep track of where the related resources are in the Navigator. For this reason, the Navigator has support to synchronize its tree view with the currently edited resource. To link resources between the Navigator and the editors in the workbench, locate the Link button in the Navigator toolbar at the top of its UI. The Link button is an icon with two arrows pointing to each other. Move the mouse over it; hover help should read Link with Editor. This technique also applies to the JDTs Package Explorer.I read the above and some other blogs.It is said that it is very useful and necessary while working on large project. what does it do exactly? i can't grasp it .

Installed java 7 on mac osx but terminal is still using version 6," I've installed JDK 7u7 downloaded from oracle's website.

ActiveMQ won't restart," Locally to start/stop ActiveMQ (5.6) on my dev machine I just run ./activemq start and ./activemq stop respectively.On our QA machine we have it installed as a service and run service activemq start and service activemq stop respectively.I just went to bounce the QA machine and issued service activemq stop, then service activemq start to restart it.I see a process ID being created, and if I run ps -aef | grep activemq I see the living, breathing process of an ActiveMQ server.But if I go to http://<qa-server>:8161/admin I get the typical error that you see when a server is down: Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at :8161.Edit: I have now tried both the ./active start and service activemq start methods, and both produce the same issue: I see a process being created, but nothing in the web admin tool.I checked ActiveMQ's home directory and don't see any type of logs/ directory, so I'm not even sure where to begin debugging the issue.Either AMQ is not restarting, or its web admin app isn't restarting or functioning properly; either way I have no idea where to start.

Conditioanl operators in Java throw an unexpected NullPointerException," Possible Duplicate: NullPointerException through auto-boxing-behavior of Java ternary operator The following code uses simple conditional operators. This code compiles fine. All the expressions ultimately attempt to assign null to Integer type variables exp1, exp2 and exp3 respectively.The first two cases don't throw any exception and produce exp1 = null exp2 = null which is obvious. The last case however, if you go through it carefully, you will see it also attempts to assign null to Integer type variable exp3 and looks something similar to the preceding two cases but it causes the NulllPointerException to be thrown. Why does it happen?Before I posted my question, I have referred to this nice question but in this case, I couldn't find what rules as specified by JLS are applied here. <code>  public class Main{ public static void main(String[] args) { Integer exp1 = true ? null : 5; Integer exp2 = true ? null : true ? null : 50; System.out.println(""exp1 = "" +exp1+"" exp2 = ""+exp2); Integer exp3 = false ? 5 : true ? null: 50; //Causes the NullPointerException to be thrown.

Why does division by zero with floating point (or double precession) numbers not throw java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero in Java," The following statement throws java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero as obvious. because the literal 0 is considered to be an int literal and divide by zero is not allowed in integer arithmetic.The following case however doesn't throw any exception like java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero. It displays Infinity.The following statement produces NaN (Not a Number) with no exception. In this case, both of the operands are considered to be double.Similarly, the following statements don't throw any exception. They produce the following output. They all return false. Why is this operation (division by zero) allowed with floating point or double precision numbers?By the way, I can understand that floating point numbers (double precision numbers) have their values that represent positive infinity, negative infinity, not a number (NaN)... <code>  System.out.println(0/0); int a = 0;double b = 6.199;System.out.println((b/a)); System.out.println(0D/0); //or 0.0/0, or 0.0/0.0 or 0/0.0 - floating point arithmetic. double div1 = 0D/0; //or 0D/0Ddouble div2 = 0/0D; //or 0D/0DSystem.out.printf(""div1 = %s : div2 = %s%n"", div1, div2);System.out.printf(""div1 == div2 : %b%n"", div1 == div2);System.out.printf(""div1 == div1 : %b%n"", div1 == div1);System.out.printf(""div2 == div2 : %b%n"", div2 == div2);System.out.printf(""Double.NaN == Double.NaN : %b%n"", Double.NaN == Double.NaN);System.out.printf(""Float.NaN == Float.NaN : %b%n"", Float.NaN == Float.NaN); div1 = NaN : div2 = NaNdiv1 == div2 : falsediv1 == div1 : falsediv2 == div2 : falseDouble.NaN == Double.NaN : falseFloat.NaN == Float.NaN : false",Why does division by zero with floating point (or double precision) numbers not throw java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero in Java
Blackberry class equivalent to AsyncTask?," My requirement is to have a thread that maintains a socket connection between a BlackBerry device and a server and exchanges commands, similar to request and response. My problem is that I need to have this thread running in the background all the time and keep the UI available to the user. So, when there is a command from the server, this thread parses it and updates the UI and also if there's an action from the BlackBerry user, it sends it to the server and the server in turn handles it. I developed the same application in Android using AsyncTask and it's working well. But in BlackBerry, as there's no such class, I used the invokeLater() option. The communication works fine between the server and the BB device, but the UI is frozen on the BlackBerry. Anyone have any idea how to get this right? <code> ",BlackBerry class equivalent to AsyncTask?

"Given that java preferences has been removed from OSX, how can I bundle a jnlp with a dock icon"," The option to package a JNLP as an app does not appear to exist in Oracle's JDK 7 Java Preferences page as it did in apples as stated here OS X desktop integration with Java Web Start lets users create a local application bundle from any Java Web Start application. The Shortcut Creation setting in Java Preferences controls whether the user is prompted to create an application bundle when opening a Java Web Start application. Bundled Java Web Start applications have all of the benefits of native application bundles, which are described in OS X Application Bundles.To work around this I'm using Automator to create an .app which runs a shell script that executes a JNLP. This allows me to use an app icon, but all my attempts of configuring the dock icon have failed.I've tried creating an .icns file using iconutil and adding that to the Resources folder, then specifying the .icns file in Contents/Info.plist under the field ""Icon File"" but I still get the java coffee cup icon in the dock when running the app.Another thing I've tried is passing the -Xdock:icon=icon.jpg argument to javaws but this appears to only work with regular java programs. <code> ",How can I bundle a jnlp with an OSX dock icon; this no longer appears to be possible in the java preferences

Here is the Snowman class that was written by my teacher (code for other objects have not been included for convenience): This object, among others, is later instantiated in the SnowmanCartoon class: Here are my concerns:In both of these classes, why is there a method of the same name as the class, and what is its purpose?Why is the method setLocation() a void method while the method Snowman() is not, even though Snowman() does not return anything? In the SnowmanCartoon class, when it says private Snowman _snowman; and _snowman = new Snowman();, is Snowman referring to the Snowman class, or rather the Snowman() method? If the instantiation of the Snowman object is referring to the Snowman() method to set all of its properties, why don't I need to use the dot operator: Snowman.Snowman()?In my textbook, instance variables and methods are declared in a one class and are instantiated in another. However, they seem to occur simultaneously in my teacher's code. <code>  public class Snowman { private Ellipse _top; private Ellipse _middle; private Ellipse _bottom;public Snowman() { _top = new Ellipse(); _top.setColor(Color.WHITE); _top.setFrameColor(Color.BLACK); _top.setFrameThickness(1); _top.setSize(80, 80); _middle = new Ellipse(); _middle.setColor(Color.WHITE); _middle.setFrameColor(Color.BLACK); _middle.setFrameThickness(1); _middle.setSize(120, 120); _bottom = new Ellipse(); _bottom.setColor(Color.WHITE); _bottom.setFrameColor(Color.BLACK); _bottom.setFrameThickness(1); _bottom.setSize(160, 160); } public void setLocation(int x, int y) { _top.setLocation(x + 40, y - 170); _middle.setLocation(x + 20, y - 100); _bottom.setLocation(x, y); }} public class SnowmanCartoon extends Frame{ private Snowman _snowman; private Eyes _eyes; private Hat _hat; private Bubble _bubble; public SnowmanCartoon() { _snowman = new Snowman(); _snowman.setLocation(100, 300); _eyes = new Eyes(); _eyes.setLocation(165, 150); _hat = new Hat(); _hat.setLocation(152, 98); _bubble = new Bubble(); _bubble.setLocation(280, 60); } public static void main(String[] args) { new SnowmanCartoon(); }}",What is the proper usage of a constructor when instantiating in the main class?

"Covariance and Contravariance in Scala, java"," I understand the terms co-variance and contra-variance. But there is one small thing I am unable to understand.

And let a function be : and I have the function call as So basically what is happeneing is that Animal a = d. And according to wiki covariance is ""Converting wider to narrow"". And above we are converting from dog to Animal. SO isnt the argument type covariant rather than contravariant? <code>  void getSomething(Animal a){ Dog d = new Dog();getSomething(d)",Isn't the argument type co- not contra-variant?
How to avoid ConcurrentModificationException," Whenever we use java.util Collection classes, we have that if one thread changes a collection while another thread is traversing through it using an iterator, then any call to iterator.hasNext() or iterator.next() will throw ConcurrentModificationException. Even the synchronized collection wrapper classes SynchronizedMap and SynchronizedList are only conditionally thread-safe, which means all individual operations are thread-safe but compound operations where flow of control depends on the results of previous operations may be subject to threading issues. The question is: How to avoid this problem without affecting the performance. Note: I am aware of CopyOnWriteArrayList. <code> ",How to avoid ConcurrentModificationException in multi-threaded code

"How to get the binary name of a java class, if one has only the simple name?"," The reflection classes and methods as well as class loaders etc. need the so called ""binary"" names of classes to work with.The question is, how does one get the binary name if one only has the fully qualified name, i.e. the name that one would use in source code.For example: The fully qualified name of the class would be frege.RT.X. Yet, to get the class object, one needs to write: and not because X happens to be an inner class of frege.RT.A possible, but clumsy, solution would be to replace . with $ from backwards, one by one, until Class.forName() doesn't throw ClassNotFoundException anymore or there are no more . to replace.Is there any better/well known/standard solution? I looked in the API docs for Class, CLassLoader and java.lang.reflect but did not find anything usable. <code>  package frege;public static class RT { .... public static class X { .... }} Class.forName(""frege.RT$X"") Class.forName(""frege.RT.X"") // fails with ClassNotFoundException","How to get the binary name of a java class, if one has only the fully qualified name?"

Java - BufferedWriter limit? Writing is randomly cut off without explanation," I have a Java program that reads some text from a file, line by line, and writes new text to an output file. But not all the text I write to my BufferedWriter appears in the output file after the program has finished. Why is that?The details: the program takes a CSV text document and converts it into SQL commands to insert the data into a table. The text file has more than 10000 lines which look similar to following: The program seems to work fine except it just stops in the file randomly half way through creating a new SQL statement having printed it into the SQL file. It looks something like: This happens after about 10000 lines but several hundred lines before the end of the file. Where the break happens is between a 1 and a ,. However, the characters doesn't seem important because if I change the 1 to a 42 the last thing written to the new file is 4, which is cutting off the 2 from that integer.

Regex: Make at least one group mandatory," I have a question about regexes in Java, though I think this might apply to other languages as well.I have a regex to parse time from a field where user may enter something like 4d 8h 42m. Of course, I want to make it as flexible as possible, so that user should not be obliged to type all numbers (and enter a mere 15h for instance).My regex is quite satisfactory concerning that point: (?:([\d]+)d)?[\s]*(?:([\d]+)h)?[\s]*(?:([\d]+)m)?Now my problem is that it will also match an empty string, though I would like it to ensure that at least one time-unit is filled.The current solution would be to arbitrary choose one of them to be mandatory, but I am not satisfied with it since mandatory field is what I am trying to avoid.Also, making an or does not suit me, since I would have to test groups when parsing the regex afterwards, instead of just accessing group(1) for days, group(2) for hours, ...(This is what I think of when speaking of an or : (?:([\d]+)d[\s]*(?:([\d]+)h)?[\s]*(?:([\d]+)m)?|(?:([\d]+)d)?[\s]*([\d]+)h[\s]*(?:([\d]+)m)?|(?:([\d]+)d)?[\s]*(?:([\d]+)h)?[\s]*([\d]+)m), to be understood as days mandatory or hours mandatory or minutes mandatory).So how could I modify my regex to make sure that at least one of my now-non-capturing group is not empty, be it days, hours or minutes? <code> ",Make at least one group mandatory

Is there any utility class in Spring or Apache Commons that re-throw a throwable as unchecked?," I am catching all throwables in a unit test wrapper method in order to reset some data in an external system. I want to re-throw the original exception when this is done and I am using this piece of code to do it: However, is there any existing utility call that does this already?(I am catching throwables because AssertionErrors are Errors.)Edit: To be honest, I don't really want to wrap the exception, so any trick that would allow me to throw any throwable (including checked exceptions) without declaring throws is acceptable. <code>  if (t instanceof RuntimeException) { throw (RuntimeException) t;} else if (t instanceof Error) { throw (Error) t;} else { throw new RuntimeException(t);}",Utility class that re-throws a throwable as unchecked?

Java program(tomcat) keeps eating memory(RES in top)," I am running Tomcat on a 4-cpu and 32GB memory 64 bit machine (OS is CentOS 6.3). The Java option I start Tomcat with is -server -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512mAt the beginning, RES is just 810MB using top, and it keeps increasing. During this period, I run jmap -J-d64 -histo pID to check the Java memory heap, and I think the gc works fine, because heap peak is 510MB and around 200MB after gc. But when RES in top hits 1.1g, the CPU usage will exceeds 100% and Tomcat will hang.Using jstack pid to see the dump when the CPU usage is 100%, a thread named ""vm thread"" eats up almost 100% CPU. I googled, it is the JVM gc thread. So my question is: Why does res keep growing when gc works fine? How could I resolve this problem? Thanks. <code> ",Java program (Tomcat) keeps eating memory (RES in top)

Is the interface by default extends the super class Object?," If you define a interface like below The in any code section you can write like Then from where the equals method come, is the interface also extends the super class Object ?, if that true how an interface can extends a class?Suppose let the interface extends the super class Object , then if you see why the collection interface like Set thave define the equals() and hashCode() method ?. All the class extends the Object class so if you define any abstract method in a interface which present in Object class then who implement the interface they no need to implements those method. Like in below code Here the class A no need to implements the method toString() as it's present in Object class.Then what is the objective of defining those method in collection interface as they can't force there implementation class to implement those method. <code>  interface I1{} I1 i1;i1.equals(null); interface I1{String toString();}class A implements I1{}",Does an interface by default extend Object?

Overhead of a Java System call," Possible Duplicate: What makes JNI calls slow? First let me say that this questions is born more out of curiosity than real necessity.I'm curious to know what is the overhead in doing a JNI call from Java, with say, System.arraycopy versus allocating the array and copying the elements over with a for loop.If the overhead is substantial, then there is probably a rough ""magic number"" of elements up to which it compensates to simply use a for loop, instead of using the System call. And also, what exactly is involved in the System call that causes this overhead? I'm guessing the stack must be pushed to the context of the call, and that might take a while, but I can't find a good explanation for the whole process.Let me clarify my question:I know that using arraycopy is the fastest way to copy an array in Java.That being said, let's say I'm using it to copy an array of only one element. Since I'm calling the underlying OS to do so, there has to be an overhead in this call. I'm interested in knowing what this overhead is and what happens in the process of the call.I'm sorry if using arraycopy misled you from the purpose of my question. I'm interested to know the overhead of a JNI call, and what's involved in the actual call. <code> ",Overhead of a Java JNI call

How does the visitor pattern not violate the Open Close Priniciple?," From Wikipedia : The idea was that once completed, the implementation of a class could only be modified to correct errors; new or changed features would require that a different class be created. That class could reuse coding from the original class through inheritanceFrom what I understand, The Visitor pattern is a powerful technique to traverse similar but different objects that implement the same Interface by the use of double dispatch. In one of my Java examples, I created a composite set of objects that form a tree structure, and each specific implementation of those objects implement the visitable interface. The visitor interface has a method for each of the visitable objects, and the concrete visitor implements what to do for each of those cases.The thing I'm trying to get my head around is the fact that if I were to add a new implementation to the composite structure that also implements visitable, then I need to reopen the visitor interface and add that case to it, also forcing me to modify each implementation of visitor. While this is fine, since I would need to do this anyway (What good is adding to your visitables if the visitor can't understand them?) but on an academic level, wouldn't this be violating the Open Closed Principle? Isn't that one of the core reasons for Design Patterns anyway? Trying to show a decent reason for switching to this pattern instead of maintaining a switch statement to end all switch statements, but everyone argues that the code will be the same anyways, with a method for each case instead of a switch block, just broken up and harder to read. <code> ",How does the Visitor Pattern not violate the Open/Closed Principle?

How to use JNA to call String returning Delphi function from Java," I'm working on calling functions from a Delphi compiled *.so file from a Java program.

ProcessBuilder: Capturing stdout and stderr of started processes to another stream," I'm building a process in Java using ProcessBuilder as follows: Now my problem is the following: I would like to capture whatever is going through stdout and/or stderr of that process and redirect it to System.out asynchronously. I want the process and its output redirection to run in the background. So far, the only way I've found to do this is to manually spawn a new thread that will continuously read from stdOut and then call the appropriate write() method of System.out. While that approach kind of works, it feels a bit dirty. And on top of that, it gives me one more thread to manage and terminate correctly. Is there any better way to do this? <code>  ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder() .command(""somecommand"", ""arg1"", ""arg2"") .redirectErrorStream(true);Process p = pb.start();InputStream stdOut = p.getInputStream(); new Thread(new Runnable(){ public void run(){ byte[] buffer = new byte[8192]; int len = -1; while((len = stdOut.read(buffer)) > 0){ System.out.write(buffer, 0, len); } }}).start();",ProcessBuilder: Forwarding stdout and stderr of started processes without blocking the main thread

Elegant way of counting occurances in a java collection," Given a collection of objects with possible duplicates, I'd like end up with a count of occurrences per object. I do it by initializing an empty Map, then iterating through the Collection and mapping the object to its count (incrementing the count each time the map already contains the object). This looks too verbose for a simple logic of counting occurrences. Is there a more elegant/shorter way of doing this? I'm open to a completely different algorithm or a java language specific feature that allows for a shorter code. <code>  public Map<Object, Integer> countOccurrences(Collection<Object> list) { Map<Object, Integer> occurrenceMap = new HashMap<Object, Integer>(); for (Object obj : list) { Integer numOccurrence = occurrenceMap.get(obj); if (numOccurrence == null) { //first count occurrenceMap.put(obj, 1); } else { occurrenceMap.put(obj, numOccurrence++); } } return occurrenceMap;}",Elegant way of counting occurrences in a java collection
Java JNI Calls Slower Than Expected?," I've read from several other reports that people generally get around 4-80 ns on a plain, basic JNI call:From What makes JNI calls slow? For trivial native methods, last year I found calls to average 40 ns on my Windows desktop, and 11 ns on my Mac desktop ..From Possible increase of performace using JNI? However JNI calls often take around 30 ns ..When I call simple methods in my JNI code (by simple I mean no more than one argument of time int returning type int), I'm getting a round trip call time (measured with System.nanoTIme) of between 50,000-80,000 ns.If I do a VM ""warm-up"" and run the call a few hundred times before timing it, I still get about 2000-4000 ns (800-1000 below). (As stated above, I have heard others report < 100 ns.. and having 10-20 times higher than that does add up when making frequent calls.)Is this normal speed? What could be causing my native code to be called so much slower?UPDATE: Where X2D_correctGamma(int,float) is a method to correct a pixel's gamma value (I've implemented native code since posting).Java benchmarking: That's the ""warm-up"" code.

"Does Maven plugin see ""configuration"" tag from the ""execution"" section automatically?"," I'm analyzing a Maven plugin that I can configure inside the configuration section of plugin: The plugin completely ignores any configuration items for an execution, though: I run Maven with mvn test. I'm sure that the execution takes place, as Maven prints its id correctly, but the plugin is not configured -- prints warnings about incorrect settings that are not present when the <configuration> section is moved outside of <executions>.The question: is it the way the plugin is implemented, that it accepts only ""top level"" configuration? I've studied its source code and it seemed to me that it's Maven that invokes setters on a MOJO class and it's transparent to the plugin which section the options came from. The MOJO is annotated with: <code>  <plugin> ... <executions>...</executions> <configuration> <!-- items placed here are visible to the MOJO --> </configuration></plugin> <plugin> ... <executions> <execution> <id>execution1</id> <phase>test</phase> <goals><goal>test</goal></goals> <configuration> <!-- items placed here are ignored --> </configuration> </execution> </executions></plugin> * @component* @goal test* @phase test* @execute phase=""jasmine-process-test-resources""","Can a Maven plugin see the ""configuration"" tag from an ""execution"" section automatically?"
Java - Logging Exceptions - how to log as much information as possible?," There's a common problem I've come across a few times when logging exceptions in Java. There seem to be various different types to deal with. E.g. some wrap other exceptions and some don't have a message at all - only a type.Most code I've seen logs an exception by using either getMessage() or toString(). But these methods don't always capture all the information needed to pinpoint the problem - other methods such as getCause() and getStackTrace() sometimes provide additional info.For example, the exception I'm looking at right now in my Eclipse Inspect window is an InvocationTargetException. The exception itself has no cause, no message, no stacktrace ... but the target from getCause() is InvalidUseOfMatchersException, with these details populated.So my question is: Given an exception of any type as an input, please provide a single method that will output a nicely formatted string containing all relevant information about the Exception (e.g. possibly recursively calling getCause() amongst other things?) Before posting, I was nearly going to have a stab at it myself but really don't want to reinvent the wheel - surely such a thing must have been done many times before...?Please don't point me at any particular logging or utility framework to do this. I'm looking for a fragment of code rather than a library since I don't have the right to add external dependencies on the project I'm working on and it's actually being logged to part of a webpage rather than a file. If it's a case of copying the code fragment out of such a framework (and attributing it) that's fine :-) <code> ",How to log as much information as possible for an exception in Java?

In the MultiTenantConnectionProvider I've simply wrote some dumb code for now that just returns a new connection every time, and the CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver always returns the same ID at this point.

Developing a CalDav server in java," I have a set of events saved in my database (a very special database, so I can't use some popular open-source servers with, say, MySQL). Now I want to build a CalDav server (by Java) so that a user can connect his calendar client to it to retrieve or modify events. I'm new to this so have a lot of questions, hope you guys help me out. What are the general steps? Do I need to offer a servlet? If yes, then what must I return for a request? a JSON or XML or .ics file? When a user subscribe to my calendar, does that mean that his client will pull my server (call the servlet) after an interval.Update: this is 1-year old question since I first asked but I got quite some upvotes, so I'm obliged to provide some info: I ended up using Milton library http://milton.io/, it abstracts away the servlets, you just have to write functions to return data. The author of the library is quite helpful and informative. The end-result: our caldav server has worked.I also accept Evert's answer. <code> ",Developing a CalDav server

Speed up EntityManagerFactory creation," In my desktop application new databases get opened quite often. I use Hibernate/JPA as an ORM.The problem is, creating the EntityManagerFactory is quite slow, taking about 5-6 Seconds on a fast machine. I know that the EntityManagerFactory is supposed to be heavyweight but this is just too slow for a desktop application where the user expects the new database to be opened quickly.Can I turn off some EntityManagerFactory features to get an instancefaster? Or is it possible to create some of the EntityManagerFactory lazily to speed up cration?Can I somehow create the EntityManagerFactory object beforeknowing the database url? I would be happy to turn off allvalidation for this to be possible.By doing so, can I pool EntityManagerFactorys for later use?Any other idea how to create the EntityManagerFactory faster?Update with more Information and JProfiler profilingThe desktop application can open saved files. Our application document file format constists of 1 SQLite database + and some binary data in a ZIP file. When opening a document, the ZIP gets extracted and the db is opened with Hibernate. The databases all have the same schema, but different data obviously.It seems that the first time I open a file it takes significantly longer than the following times.I profiled the first and second run with JProfiler and compared the results.1st Run: .2nd Run: .In the Call tree comparison you can see that some methods are significantly faster (DatabaseManager. as starting point): The Hot spot comparison now has the interesting results:. I am not sure if it is the loading of Hibernate classes or my Entity classes.A first improvement would be to create an EMF as soon as the application starts just to initialize all necessary classes (I have an empty db file as a prototype already shipped with my Application). @sharakan thank you for your answer, maybe a DeferredConnectionProvider would already be a solution for this problem.I will try the DeferredConnectionProvider next!

RabbitMQ for JVM integration tests - integration testing of a polyglot stack," I am aware RabbitMQ is written in Erlang and thus can't be embedded in a JVM like we would do with the ActiveMQ JMS broker for exemple.But actually there are some projects that are done in another language and that can easily be embedded for integration tests.For exemple, MongoDB, written in C++, can be easily started/stopped in the context of a JVM integration test with: https://github.com/flapdoodle-oss/embedmongo.flapdoodle.deThere is also someone porting it to Java:https://github.com/thiloplanz/jmockmongo/So I just wonder how can we do integration tests when my application is written in Java, and the other technology is in another langage (like Erlang for RabbitMQ)? In general what are the good practices? I see 3 main solutions:Starting a real RabbitMQ Embedding a JVM port of the technology in the currently used LangageUse standard technologies so that a technology in Erlang may have the same behavior and communication layer that another one in Java (RabbitMQ / Qpid / StormMQ implementing AMQP)Is there a Maven/Sbt/Ant plugin to startup a temporary RabbitMQ broker? Any project to support Junit/TestNG RabbitMQ before a test class?I have seen that there is an opensource implementation of AMQP in Java: Apache QpidHas someone any experience using this implementation for integration testing while in production there is RabbitMQ? Is it even possible?I am using Spring Integration.By the way, I just noticed that the Spring-AMQP project mention on its github readme: Many of the ""integration"" tests here require a running RabbitMQ server - they will be skipped if the broker is not detected. <code> ",Integration tests of a polyglot stack (Java/MongoDB/RabbitMQ...)

Problems started when I started using a thread pool," I use a ProcessBuilder to run processes. I handle Input/Output streams by submitting the corresponding runnables handling them in a thread pool (Executors.newCachedThreadPool()).I get the result but every now and then I don't get anything.For instance if I do: cmd \C dir to the process builder I get the results of dir back but sometimes I don't get anything (despite that the result seems to comeback from the runnable that handles the process.getInputStream).How can I debug this? It shows up intermitently.With the same code I did not have any problem when I did new Thread(runnable).start(). It started to happen after I switched to a thread pool. Update:I think I found something:I do the following in the Runnable: In the cases that does not work it prints Finished reading 521. But I try to get the result via the pw and not sb.pw is PrintWriter pw = PrintWriter(outputStream);` which I pass in the runnable Update 2:It seems that:status = process.waitFor(); returns earlier before the runnable that handled the inputstream finishes. How can this happen?I read in the javadoc:the calling thread will be blocked until the subprocess exits. So does that mean that I could return before consuming the I/O streams? Update 3:Seems to be the same issue here in Ruby I.e. there is some race condition between the process ending and consuming the output <code>  try { while ( (line = br.readLine()) != null) { pw.println(line); sb.append(line); } System.out.println(""Finished reading ""+sb.length()); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally{ pw.flush(); try{ isr.close(); }catch(Exception e){} }",Concurrency issue between waiting for a process and reading the stream?

Cached map with data initialization at first and refreshed periodically in Java," I need a cached map in my Java code.

Understanding Hibernate named queries and its performance advantage?," As hibernate document says that purpose of named query is to clear the HQL from different places in project to single place in some xml (in case of declarative approach).This means no recompilation is required n case of query modification but reloading of session factory is required which means server start up in most of the cases as query object is cached. But in case of annotation i need to define the named queries at entity level. So here compilation again requires. My question here is does named query help in performance also. Here is my understanding:-1)when i use named queries, just query object is cached in second level cache. When i say just query object it means just query syntax is cached not the query results.Right? If its right then probably its useful only in case of HQL becoz thats where we can avoid traslation of HQL to native query ,every time query is fired and have some good time performance. But if we are using native sql, named query does not provide that advantage as no translation happens in that case.So main advantage of named query is to make central repository of sqls. Yes in case of HQL it can save us some translation time to native sql also but keep in mind that query object will lie for the life time of jvm and will consume some memory. So some trade off here. <code> ",Hibernate named queries and its performance advantage?

"Difference of connection pool, jdbc and jndi"," I need to know if my understanding on the above is correct.In a connection pool you set multiple connections with the use of java.sql.Datasource.In jdbc we directly specify the connection url and oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver and it's always one connection, where another request has to wait until the connection has finished processing. And with JNDI it's similar to direct jdbc where we refer the jdbc setting via a name, so that we can specify the connection url and other setting in the application server and not have them bound to the application, right? <code> ","Differences of connection pool, jdbc and jndi"

If you know you only need it for a particular processing, you can null it right after to help the GC.Assume I really need those two to be fields, and not only internal variables, so heavyObject1 cannot be out of scope at the end of the method.Would you do this as a general practice? <code>  public class TestClass { public static Object heavyObject1; public static Object object2; private static void action() { object2 = doSomething(heavyObject1); heavyObject1 = null; //is this good? }}",Is it a good practice to remove references to help the GC?

How equals() method works," I am digging into the basics of Java.

Output:a.hashCode() 97 b.hashCode() 97 false trueThe actual Java language 'equals' method: In my above example, a.equals(b) has returned true, meaning the condition 'a==b' is satisfied. But then why is 'a==b' returning false in that example?Aren't hashCode and address one and same? Also, is 'hashCode' compared when we say 'a==b' or something else? <code>  public class Equals { /** * @param args */ public static void main(String[] args) { String a = new String(""a""); String b = new String(""a""); System.out.println(""a.hashCode() ""+a.hashCode()); System.out.println(""b.hashCode() ""+b.hashCode()); System.out.println(a == b); System.out.println(a.equals(b)); }} public boolean equals(Object obj) { return (this == obj); }",How the equals() method works

I clearly see that this code is stinks, so is there a way to achieve this or do I have to write each param class separately?PS: I know I shoud make the default class abstract and use getters, I'm just curious if there is a way to make the values accesible statically. <code>  class ParamsGeneral { public static final int H_FACTOR = 100; public static int MAX_SCORE = 1000; ...} class ParamsLimited extends ParamsGeneral { public static int MAX_SCORE = 500; // other params stay same} class Player { ParamsGeneral par; public Player() { if(onLimitedMap()){ par = new ParamLimited(); } } public boolean isWinner() { if(this.score == par.MAX_SCORE) { return true; } return false; }}",How to inherit static field and change it's value?

java equals method using generics and instanceof," I have a class that accepts a generic type, and I want to override the equals method in a non-awkward way (i.e. something that looks clean and has minimal amount of code, but for a very general use case).Right now I have something like this: Which, I'm guessing, is pretty flawed - I'm doing a cast to SingularNode<T> on the other object, which could potentially throw an error. Another thing is - when I do if(other instanceof SingularNode<?>) I'm actually not checking exactly the right thing. I actually want to check against type T and not type ?. Whenever I try to make the ? into T, I get some error like: Cannot perform instanceof check against parameterized type SingularNode<T>. Use the form SingularNode<?> instead, since further generic type information will be erased at runtimeHow can I get around this? Is there some way to do T.class.isInstance(other); ?I suppose there's one really ugly hack solution like this: But that just looks really awkward with the extra method parameter, and it's also not a built-in function like equals is.Any one who understand generics please explain this? I'm not that proficient with Java, as you can clearly see, so please explain with a tad bit more detail! <code>  public class SingularNode<T> { private T value; @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"") @Override public boolean equals(Object other){ if(other instanceof SingularNode<?>){ if(((SingularNode<T>)other).value.equals(value)){ return true; } } return false; }} @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"")public boolean isEqualTo(Class<?> c, Object obj){ if(c.isInstance(obj) && c.isInstance(this)){ if(((SingularNode<T>)obj).value.equals(value)){ return true; } } return false;}","How to implement ""equals"" method for generics using ""instanceof""?"

Java Static Initializer Quirk," I noticed something in static initializers which may be a bug in the javac. I have constructed a scenario where I can assign a variable a value but not read that value back.The two examples are below, the first compiles fine, the second gets an error when trying to read a value from tmp, but for some reason assigning a value to tmp is permitted. I could understand if it could neither read nor write to the variable since tmp is declared after the static initializer, but an error on only one of those does not make sense to me. to emphasize the point further, this does compile successfully. <code>  //Compiles Successfully:public class Script{ public static Object tmp; static { tmp = new Object(); System.out.println(tmp); }}//error only on the read but not the assignmentpublic class Script{ static { tmp = new Object(); System.out.println(tmp); } public static Object tmp;} public class Script{ static { tmp = new Object(); } public static Object tmp;}",Static initializer error if placed before the declaration

Transating generic wildcards from Java to Scala," In the java.util.Collections class, we have two variants of the sort method, one that takes a list of arbitrary objects with a corresponding Comparator: And one that takes a list of Comparable objects: I was thinking how one woulds translate such method signatures with bounded wildcards into Scala. For the first version, I translated the signature literally and at first sight without compilation problems: But then I found that I could not invoke this method with the following arguments: The last line gives this compile error, even though I explicitly specify the type T as Object. type mismatch; found : java.util.ArrayList[Number] required: java.util.List[Object] Note: Number <: Object, but Java-defined trait List is invariant in type E. You may wish to investigate a wildcard type such as _ <: Object. (SLS 3.2.10)Actually, I found out that it's even impossible to call the sole Java method directly as it fails with the same type of error. As for the version with comparable list, I came up with this declaration: But this doesn't work at all: illegal cyclic reference involving type TWhat am I doing wrong? Are Scala variant generics following different rules the the Java ones? How call one call the Collections.sort method without actually getting a compile error?Side note:No, I'm not really asking how I can sort a list in Scala. I know that Scala has its own set of collections, sort functions and a different approach to comparing objects (such as Ordered and Ordering traits). My question concerns the general problem of generic methods and translation of generics from Java to Scala. <code>  public static <T> void sort(List<T> list, Comparator<? super T> comparator) public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> void sort(List<T> list) def sort[T](list: List[T], comparator: Comparator[_ >: T]) { ??? } val comparator = new Comparator[Object] { def compare(o1: Object, o2: Object) = ???}val list = new ArrayList[Number]sort[Object](list, comparator) Collections.sort[Object](list, comparator) def sort[T <: Comparable[_ >: T]](list: List[T]) { ??? }",Translating generic wildcards from Java to Scala

Java When should I use InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter," From the Java Tutorial site, we know InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter can convert streams between bytes and characters.InputStreamReader converts bytes read from input to characters, while OutputStreamWriter converts characters to bytes to output.But when should I use this two classes?We have Inputstream/OutputStream input/output byte by byte, and Reader/Writer input/output character by character.So when using InputStreamReader to input characters from byte stream, why not just use Reader class (or its sub classes) to read character directly? Why not use OutputStream instead of OutputStreamWriter to write bytes directly?EDIT:When do I need to convert streams between bytes and characters using InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter?EDIT:Under which circumstances should I care about encoding scheme? <code> ",When should I use InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter?
"Java, git, IDE multiple code styles"," I am collaborating on a git-sourced, maven-managed Java project with differing code styling preferences with users using multiple IDE's (note 1). Is there a tool or IDE configuration that will allow code to be viewed and edited using style-1, but committed to SCM using style-2?My research points me to 'no', but a solution combining git hooks and Checkstyle/jrefactory might be possible.So if 'no' to above, is there a tool/process that will perform the TBD process actions below?The checkout process flow for User1 would be:git pull TBD process formats code to User1 style-1User1 works in their preferred IDE with style-1 settingsThe commit workflow for User1 would be:User1 is ready to commit/push codeTBD process formats code to standard format style-standardgit pushNote 1: multiple IDE's = Eclipse, IntelliJ, Netbeans.Note 2: My question differs from this question in that I'd like to focus on an IDE-related solution, since forcing the minority of standards-divergent users is probably a more efficient solution.Note 3: Acknowledging that this shouldn't be done for best-practices-reasons. However, if you grant that it's time expect more flexibility from our IDEs and SCMs, this question is intended to explore those solutions. <code> ",How to accommodate multiple coding styles?

Concrete method in abstract class Java, I understand an abstract class may contain abstract and concrete methods (i.e with body implementation).

Gaining control on the name of the temp file created in java," Is there any way to control the random digits appended to a file name when a tempFile is created ? For eg. if I write File.createTempFile(""abc"","".pdf""), it creates a file with name abc12323543121.pdf. Instead of these digits, is it possible to append a timestamp ? I need this because for every file that i create, I need to append the timestamp to the file, which makes the file name quite long. So, instead of the randomly generated digits,if I could just use the timestamp, it would be really great. <code> ",Gaining control on the name of the temp file created in Java
Java pattern Matcher freezes when matching line that contains \n," I came across a problem I find quite interesting. I'm doing some basic parsing of text files mostly by regex and it always freezes when matching this line No exception is thrown; the program just hangs. I'm posting the snippet of the program that recreates the situation; the commented one is possible standard situation, but the other one is the problematic. If you delete the \n it works, but these parsed files comes like this from ""blackbox"" system.I surely can make a workaround, I only found it interesting that it actually freezes and hoped that someone could explain what is happening. I tried it on JDK6u22 and JDK7u21... Well, I discovered that if I modify the regex to this (adding the \\\\ to the last group): I still don't know why no exception is thrown. <code>  ftrect 0.7031 57.0313 9.8561 55.5313 ""FREIGABE \nQ09_SV01"" public static Pattern FTRECT_PATTERN = Pattern.compile( ""\\s*([\\w]+)?\\:?\\s*ftrect\\s+((\\d*\\.?\\d*\\s?)+)\\s*\""?([\\w\\s\\.\\%\\/\\=]*)?\""?\\s*"");public static void main(String[] args) {// Matcher m = FTRECT_PATTERN.matcher( ""FOX_BACKGROUND: ftrect 46.1719 18.0556 54.8633 16.5556 \""Schicht\"" "" ); Matcher m = FTRECT_PATTERN.matcher( ""ftrect 0.7031 57.0313 9.8561 55.5313 \""FREIGABE \\nQ09_SV01\"""" ); System.out.println( m.matches() ); for (int i = 0; i <= m.groupCount(); i++) { String string = m.group( i ); System.out.println( string ); }} public static Pattern FTRECT_PATTERN = Pattern.compile( ""\\s*([\\w]+)?\\:?\\s*ftrect\\s+((\\d*\\.?\\d*\\s?)+)\\s*\""?([\\w\\\\\\s\\.\\%\\/\\=]*)?\""?\\s*"");",Java Pattern.matcher() freezes when matching line that contains \n
behavior of String literals are confusing," The behavior of String literals is very confusing in the code below.I can understand line 1, line 2, and line 3 are true, but why is line 4 false?When I print the hashcode of both they are the same.

Java Spring Transactional method not rolling back as expected," Below is a quick outline of what I'm trying to do. I want to push a record to two different tables in the database from one method call. If anything fails, I want everything to roll back. So if insertIntoB fails, I want anything that would be committed in insertIntoA to be rolled back. Where MyDAO dao is an interface that is mapped to the database using mybatis and is set using Spring injections. Right now if insertIntoB fails, everything from insertIntoA still gets pushed to the database. How can I correct this behavior?EDIT:I modified the class to give a more accurate description of what I'm trying to achieve. If I run insertIntoAAndB directly, the roll back works if there are any issues, but if I call insertIntoAAndB from insertRecords, the roll back doesn't work if any issues arise. <code>  public class Service { MyDAO dao; public void insertRecords(List<Record> records){ for (Record record : records){ insertIntoAAndB(record); } } @Transactional (rollbackFor = Exception.class, propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW) public void insertIntoAAndB(Record record){ insertIntoA(record); insertIntoB(record); } @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED) public void insertIntoA(Record record){ dao.insertIntoA(record); } @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED) public void insertIntoB(Record record){ dao.insertIntoB(record); } public void setMyDAO(final MyDAO dao) { this.dao = dao; }}",Java Spring @Transactional method not rolling back as expected

ServerSocket accept returns socket on arbitrary port," I've seen many answers similar to this one in regards to serversockets in java: ""Let's say you have a server with a serversocket on port 5000. Client A and Client B will be connecting to our server.Client A sends out a request to the Server on port 5000. The port on Client A's side is chosen by the Operating System. Usually, the OS picks the next port that is available. The starting point for this search is the previously-used port number + 1 (so for instance if the OS happened to us port 45546 recently, the OS would then try 45547).Assuming there are no connection problems, the Server receives Client A's request to connect on port 5000. The Server then opens up its own next available port, and sends that to the client. Here, Client A connects to the new port, and the server now has port 5000 available again.""I've seen answers like this in multiple questions on stackoverflow about how a different port is used in the returned socket of the accept() than the port that the ServerSocket is listening on. I was always under the impression that TCP is identified by the quartet of information: Client IP : Client Port and Server IP : Server Port ->protocol too (to distinguish TCP from UDP)So why would the accept() need to return a socket bound to a different port? Doesn't the quartet of information sent in every header distinguish multiple connections to the same server port from different machines enough where it would not need to use different ports on the server machine for communication?  <code> ",Does ServerSocket accept return socket on arbitrary port?

How can i handle/restrict user-access to servlets & jsp's?," I'm currently writing a little dynamic web-application in Java.The application is supposed to be an event-platform where you can create a user-account, log in, and then you can see all open events (in a later iteration, users can create/participate in those events).Right now, the structure of the web-app could be (simplified) described like this: So right now, a user could go to Login.jsp, his login-information would be sent to the Login-Servlet, which would validate it and then send it to the Main-Page-Servlet.The Main-Page-Servlet then (after validating login again) gets all current events from a database, attaches it to the request, and forwards it to the Main.jsp, which displays it for the user to see.Now, if a user wants to access the Main.jsp directly (without coming from the Main-Page-Servlet), it obviously can not display the available events. The workaround I'm using currently is doing a null-check to see if the events are there, and if not, redirect to the Main-Page-Servlet.It bothers me to solve my problem like that, as I don't think that's the best practice and I think it will just create a lot of other problems the bigger my application gets.My first thought about this was, that it might be useful if I could simply ""hide"" all .jsp's from the user, so the user would be landing on servlets only and could not access the .jsp's in a different way. Is there a way to do that? Or, if not, what would be the best practice solution if I would be writing a professional enterprise-level application? <code>  Register-Servlet -> Register.jsp | VLogin-Servlet -> Login.jsp | VMain-page-Servlet -> Main.jsp",How can I handle/restrict user-access to servlets & jsp's?

Static versus non-static lock object in sychronized block," Trying to visualize and understand synchronization. What are the differences between using a static lock object (code A) and a non-static lock object (code B) for a synchronized block? How does it differ in practical applications? What are the pitfalls one would have that the other wouldn't? What are the criteria to determine which one to use?Code A Code B Note The above code shows constructors, but you could talk about how the behavior is different in a static method and a non-static method too. Also, would it be advantageous to use a static lock when the synchronized block is modifying a static member variable?I already looked at answers in this question, but it's not clear enough what the different usage scenarios are. <code>  public class MyClass1 { private static final Object lock = new Object(); public MyClass1() { //unsync synchronized(lock) { //sync } //unsync }} public class MyClass2 { private final Object lock = new Object(); public MyClass2() { //unsync synchronized(lock) { //sync } //unsync }}",Static versus non-static lock object in synchronized block

Correct way to define a gradle plugin extension?," I'm trying to create a Gradle plugin in Java that has property extensions (not conventions, as this is apparently the old, wrong way). For the record, I'm working with Gradle 1.6 on a Linux machine (Ubuntu 12.04).I've gotten as far as figuring out that the this should be done in the Plugin class definition. Here is A way of adding an extension. Create an extension class that contains your properties: Now add these extensions to the project in the main plugin class: This approach, however, doesn't seem to be correct. A new project property is shows up in the project.ext namespace. I expect to be able to address the plugin extensions as: However, when I put such things in a gradle script that uses my plugin and try to set this property, gradle tells me I can't set it: So, what's the right way to add property extensions for a task in a Java-based Gradle plugin?EDIT:Based on some other SO posts, I tried just adding my extensions object in one shot: This appears to work. However, Gradle is now complaining that I've added a dynamic property: So, again, what's the right way to add a plugin extension property?EDIT 2So, taking yet another shot at this, I'm adding the extension to the project object and using the create method instead: However, this fails for a couple of reasons:Creating a properties extension with the same name (""myPluginTask"") as the task creates a collision between the task name and extension name, causing the task to disappear from gradle's perspective (and throw oblique errors, such as ""No such property: dependsOn for class ...MyPluginExtensions"").If I provide a name that does not collide with a task name (e.g., ""myPluginPropExt""), the create() method works, but DOES NOT add the extension in its own namespace as expected (e.g., project.myPluginPropExt.propertyName and instead adds it in the project namespace (e.g., project.propertyName) which is not correct and causes Gradle to throw a bunch of ""deprecated dynamic property"" warnings. <code>  public class MyPluginExtensions { File sourceDir; File outputDir; public MyPluginExtensions(Project project) { this.project = project; sourceDir = new File(project.getProjectDir(), ""src""); outputDir = new File(project.getBuildDir(), ""out""); }} public class MyPlugin implements Plugin<Project> { @Override public void apply(Project project) { Map<String,Object> taskInfo = new HashMap<String,Object>(); taskInfo.put(""type"", MyPluginTask.class); taskInfo.put(""description"", ""Generates blah from blah.""); taskInfo.put(""group"", ""Blah""); Task myPluginTask = project.task(taskInfo, ""myPluginTask""); // Define conventions and attach them to tasks MyPluginExtensions extensions = new MyPluginExtensions(project); myPluginTask.getExtensions().add( ""sourceDir"", extensions.sourceDir); myPluginTask.getExtensions().add( ""outputDir"", extensions.outputDir); }} in my build.gradle:myPluginTask.sourceDir = file('the/main/src')myPluginTask.outputDir = file('the/output') * What went wrong:A problem occurred evaluating script.> There's an extension registered with name 'sourceDir'.

How do Java runtimes targeting pre-SSE2 processors implement floating-point?," How does(did) a Java runtime targeting an Intel processor without SSE2 deal with floating-point denormals, when strictfp is set?Even when the 387 FPU is set for 53-bit precision, it keeps an oversized exponent range that: forces to detect underflow/overflow at each intermediate result, andmakes it difficult to avoid double-rounding of denormals.Strategies include re-computing the operation that resulted in a denormal value with emulated floating-point, or a permanent exponent offset along the lines of this technique to equip OCaml with 63-bit floats, borrowing a bit from the exponent in order to avoid double-rounding.In any case, I see no way to avoid at least one conditional branch for each floating-point computation, unless the operation can statically be determined not to underflow/overflow. How exceptional (overflow/underflow) cases are dealt with is part of my question, but this cannot be separated from the question of the representation (the permanent exponent offset strategy seems to mean that only overflows need to be checked for, for instance). <code> ",How do Java runtimes targeting pre-SSE2 processors implement floating-point basic operations?

Declaring multiple arrays with 64 elements 1000* faster then declaring array of 65 elements," Recently I noticed declaring an array containing 64 elements is a lot faster (>1000 fold) than declaring the same type of array with 65 elements.Here is the code I used to test this: This runs in approximately 6 ms, if I replace new double[64] with new double[65] it takes approximately 7 seconds.

Understanding the use of Super to access Superclass members(Java)," I was referring to the java language specification to understand the use of super. While I understand the first use case i.e. The form super.Identifier refers to the field named Identifier of the current object, but with the current object viewed as an instance of the superclass of the current class.I can't seem to understand the following use case: The form T.super.Identifier refers to the field named Identifier of the lexically enclosing instance corresponding to T, but with that instance viewed as an instance of the superclass of T.Could someone please explain this with the help of code?I suppose the following could be illustrative of the second case: output: 210 <code>  class S{ int x=0;}class T extends S{ int x=1; class C{ int x=2; void print(){ System.out.println(this.x); System.out.println(T.this.x); System.out.println(T.super.x); } } public static void main(String args[]){ T t=new T(); C c=t.new C(); c.print(); }}",Understanding the use of Super to access Superclass members

GSon serialize a list of polymorphic objects," I'm trying to serialize/deserialize an object, that involves polymorphism, into JSON using Gson.This is my code for serializing: Here's the result: The serialization mostly works, except its missing the contents of inherited members (In particular obix:BatchIn and obixBatchout strings are missing).Here's my base class: Here's what my inherited class (ObixOp) looks like: I realize I could use an adapter for this, but the problem is that I'm serializing a collection of base class type ObixBaseObj.

How to use MediaMuxer / MediaCodec with GLSurfaceView?," Following the BigFlake example there is a comment that states : I use EGL14.getCurrentContext() to query the current context and pass it into the EGL14.eglCreateContext() share_context parameter, but How do you ""switch EGL contexts""?The GLSurfaceView and MediaCodec.inputSurface have two different surfaces and two different contexts, so I assume you just call eglMakeCurrent() on each set individually, is that correct? Do you need to eglDestroyContext() or eglDestroySurface()?

The following class would be clearly not thread safe Then i can synchronize the write, but it will remain not thread safe As i would need to synchronize not only the writes, but also the reads Now the question is, by using volatile I can guarantee that other threads will see the updated value, so this makes me think that this class should be thread safe Is the last class thread-safe?? <code>  public class NotThreadSafe { private int value; public void setValue(int value) { this.value = value; } public int getValue() { return this.value; }} public class StillNotThreadSafe { private int value; public synchronized void setValue(int value) { this.value = value; } public int getValue() { return this.value; }} public class ThreadSafe { private int value; public synchronized void setValue(int value) { this.value = value; } public synchronized int getValue() { return this.value; }} public class NotSure { private volatile int value; public synchronized void setValue(int value) { this.value = value; } public int getValue() { return this.value; }}","Synchronized , volatile and thread safety"
How to use Java 8 method reference feature to get java.lang.reflect.Method info?," Please have a look at the following code: This works, but the method name is passed as a string, so this will compile even if myMethod does not exist.On the other hand, Java 8 introduces a method reference feature. It is checked at compile time. It is possible to use this feature to get method info? Full example: In other words I would like to have a code which is the equivalent of the following C# code: <code>  Method methodInfo = MyClass.class.getMethod(""myMethod""); printMethodName(MyClass::myMethod); @FunctionalInterfaceprivate interface Action { void invoke();}private static class MyClass { public static void myMethod() { }}private static void printMethodName(Action action) {}public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchMethodException { // This works, but method name is passed as a string, so this will compile // even if myMethod does not exist Method methodInfo = MyClass.class.getMethod(""myMethod""); // Here we pass reference to a method. It is somehow possible to // obtain java.lang.reflect.Method for myMethod inside printMethodName? printMethodName(MyClass::myMethod);} private static class InnerClass { public static void MyMethod() { Console.WriteLine(""Hello""); } } static void PrintMethodName(Action action) { // Can I get java.lang.reflect.Method in the same way?

Maven and code metrics : check a test case for each class," Is there something that can be used in Maven to automate this kind of check? I'm seeing checkstyle and PMD but I'm not finding this feature.Basically I'd like the build to fail if there's a class A and there's not an ATestCase. I know, it is not a strict check and can be easily bypassed by creating just the class, but at the moment that would be enough.  <code> ",Maven and code metrics: check for existence of a test case for each class

What is Persistence Context," I am new to the Java world and JPA. I was studying JPA and came across many new terms like Entity, persistence. While reading, I could not understand the exact definition for Persistence Context.Can anyone explain it in simple laymen terms?

Intellij deploying Grails app to Tomcat always results in http 404," I'm beginning grails development with IntelliJ but just cannot make and deploy a newly created grails app to a local or external Tomcat following the procedure described in this answerThe manager app in Tomcat shows that the application is up and running but I always get http 404 when opening the index page. I noticed that it's possible to download the index.gsp file - it just seems that grails isn't initialized correctly:These are the versions I tried:IntelliJ IDEA 12.1.6 UltimateGrails 2.1.1, 2.2.4 and 2.3.2Tomcat 7.0.47 and 6.These are the detailed steps I took several times, even on different computers, always with same result:create a new grails app in IntelliJ and launch default run configuration (grails) - so far that's working fine.set up deployment to a local Tomcat server. I've configured the application server in IntelliJ, creating an artifact (Web Application: Archive or Web Application: Exploded) using the GrailsWeb facet and assigned it to be deployed.start the local application server and IntelliJ would report that the artifact is deployed successfullyopening the browser will give 404WHY? What am I doing wrong?It must be something about the grails plugin in IntelliJ, because I was able to pull an example Java application (spring-petclinic) from github and simply run it in Tomcat without trouble...Update:I've noticed that I can manually deploy the war which is generated under target using ""Make Grails Web archive"". But when I do the same with the war of the artifact under out/... it won't work.Obviously the latter one wasn't generated correctly: its missing MANIFEST.MF under META-INF and there's also no grails.xml and grails-app under WEB-INF!Could you please have a look at the facets: Is there something wrong?I tried many artifact configurations, e.g. this one:Directory structure generated using the settings above:Comparing this to the war file generated by grails shows many differences, e.g. the index.gsp is located in the root, not under WEB-INF/grails-app. And there's also no grails.xml under

how to check if a jar file is valid?," My webapp allows a user to upload a JAR file. However, after the jar file is uploaded, it is corrupted. I have verified this by comparing the MD5 checksums before and after uploading the file (winmd5free).The uploaded jar file is almost identical to the original:The file size compared to the original is similar (at the KB level)I can open the uploaded jar file using an unzipping program and view it's contents (resources and class files), and everything is the same compared to the original fileWhen I open up the uploaded jar file (using Notepad++), I did notice that the binary contents are different from the original. Also, when I used JarInputStream to read the JAR entries, there were no entries. Furthermore, when I double click on the jar (Windows), I get the following message.Error: Invalid or corrupt jarfileMy questions are:Is there a way to programmatically check if a jar file is valid? I would have expected JarInputStream to detect this right away, but it shows no problems at allWhen I double click on the jar file, in windows, is it java.exe that is giving me the ""invalid or corrupt JAR file"" message?How come when an invalid jar file is passed in as part of the classpath, no error/exception is thrown? For example, by running the java -cp uploaded.jar;libs\* com.some.class.Test command?This question is irrelevant from jar signing and/or checking the signature of a JAR file. It is simply checking if a file (uploaded or not) is a valid JAR file (not necessarily if the jar's class files are valid, as there is another SO post on this issue already).My results for running jar -tvf uploaded.jar: <code>  JarInputStream is = new JarInputStream(new FileInputStream(new File(""uploaded.jar"")));JarEntry entry = null;while(null != (entry = is.getNextJarEntry())) { System.out.println(entry.getName());} java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file at java.util.zip.ZipFile.open(Native Method) at java.util.zip.ZipFile.<init>(ZipFile.java:127) at java.util.zip.ZipFile.<init>(ZipFile.java:88) at sun.tools.jar.Main.list(Main.java:977) at sun.tools.jar.Main.run(Main.java:222) at sun.tools.jar.Main.main(Main.java:1147)",How can I check if a JAR file is valid?

Significance of a PATH explined," This is probably a rudimentary question but I am still kinda new to programming and I've wondered for awhile. I've done multiple projects in Python, C#, and Java, and when I try to use new libraries (especially for Python) people always say to make sure its in the right PATH and such. I just followed an online tutorial on how to install Java on a new computer and it rekindled my question of what a path really is. Is the Path just were the programming language looks for a library in the file system? I get kinda confused on what it's significance is. Again, I'm sorry for the wide question, its just something that I've never quite gotten on my own programming.EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone so much for answering my question. I know it was a pretty dumb one now that I've finally figured out what it is, but it really helped me. I'm slowly working through as many C#, Java and Python tutorials as I can find online, and it's nice to know I have somewhere to ask questions :) <code> ",Significance of a PATH explained

Good way to null check a long list of paramters," Suppose I have a long set of of parameters all of the same type for some method. I have a similar operation to do on each parameter (if they are not null). Assume I have no control over the method signature since the class implements an interface. For example.. something simple like this. Set of String params.. Is there any way I can iterate through the list of String parameters to check if they are not null and print them without having to reference each variable separately? <code>  public void methodName(String param1, String param2, String param3, String param4){ //Only print parameters which are not null: if (param1 !=null) out.print(param1); if (param2 !=null) out.print(param2); if (param3 !=null) out.print(param3); if (param4 !=null) out.print(param4);}",Good way to null check a long list of parameters
Escaping of 'this'," I would appreciate help in understanding the following from 'Java Concurrency in Practice': Calling an overrideable instance method(one that is neither private nor final) from the constructor can also allow the this reference to escape.Does 'escape' here simply mean that we may probably be calling an instance method,before the instance is fully constructed?I do not see 'this' escaping the scope of the instance in any other way. How does 'final' prevent this from happening?Is there some aspect of 'final' in instance creation that I am missing?  <code> ",Allowing the this reference to escape

I know vectors are serializable. Do I also have to make the user-defined class implement serializable? And, each of these user-defined classes contains other user-defined classes. Do those have to be labeled as implementing Serializable as well? (and so on, or do just the top-level class need to implement Serializable)?(Forget noting that arrayLists should be used instead of vectors, I've heard that before, I'm practicing because I hear vectors are good for multithreading.

"Why does HashSet allow equal items, despite the Javadoc saying it can't, if hashcodes are different?"," The HashSet class has an add(Object o) method, which is not inherited from another class. The Javadoc for that method says the following: Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present. More formally, adds the specified element e to this set if this set contains no element e2 such that (e==null ? e2==null : e.equals(e2)). If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set unchanged and returns false.In other words, if two objects are equal, then the second object will not be added and the HashSet will remain the same. However, I've discovered that this is not true if objects e and e2 have different hashcodes, despite the fact that e.equals(e2). Here is a simple example: The results from the main method are: As the example above clearly shows, HashSet was able to add two elements where e.equals(e2).I'm going to assume that this is not a bug in Java and that there is in fact some perfectly rational explanation for why this is. But I can't figure out what exactly. What am I missing? <code>  import java.util.HashSet;import java.util.Iterator;import java.util.Random;public class BadHashCodeClass { /** * A hashcode that will randomly return an integer, so it is unlikely to be the same */ @Override public int hashCode(){ return new Random().nextInt(); } /** * An equal method that will always return true */ @Override public boolean equals(Object o){ return true; } public static void main(String... args){ HashSet<BadHashCodeClass> hashSet = new HashSet<>(); BadHashCodeClass instance = new BadHashCodeClass(); System.out.println(""Instance was added: "" + hashSet.add(instance)); System.out.println(""Instance was added: "" + hashSet.add(instance)); System.out.println(""Elements in hashSet: "" + hashSet.size()); Iterator<BadHashCodeClass> iterator = hashSet.iterator(); BadHashCodeClass e = iterator.next(); BadHashCodeClass e2 = iterator.next(); System.out.println(""Element contains e and e2 such that (e==null ? e2==null : e.equals(e2)): "" + (e==null ? e2==null : e.equals(e2))); } Instance was added: trueInstance was added: trueElements in hashSet: 2Element contains e and e2 such that (e==null ? e2==null : e.equals(e2)): true",Why does HashSet allow equal items if hashcodes are different?

"Is there a way to test if a PrintWriter is open and ready for output, WITHOUT writing to it?"," I'm looking in the JavaDoc for both PrintWriter, and its underlying Writer (its out field), and I don't see any way to confirm that the PrintWriter is indeed open. While you can test for null-ness, you can't test to see if the stream has been closed. You can also checkError(), but is being closed really considered an error?I'm not a newbie to general Java, but java.io has always been hazy to me.

Overriding getPreferredSize() breaks LSP," I always see advices in this site of overriding getPreferredSize() instead of using setPreferredSize() as shown in these previous threads for example.Use of overriding getPreferredSize() instead of using setPreferredSize() for fixed size ComponentsShould I avoid the use of set(Preferred|Maximum|Minimum)Size methods in Java Swing?Overriding setPreferredSize() and getPreferredSize()See this example: setPreferredSize() Sets the preferred size of this component. getPreferredSize() If the preferredSize has been set to a non-null value just returns it. If the UI delegate's getPreferredSize method returns a non null value then return that; otherwise defer to the component's layout manager. So doing this clearly breaks Liskov Substitution Principle.prefferedSize is a bound property so when you set it a firePropertyChange is executed. So my question is when you override getPrefferedSize() don't you need to override setPreferredSize(..) too?Example: Now we see that we get identical results but listeners will get notified with real values and besides we don't break LSP cause setPreferredSize states Sets the preferred size of this component. but not how. <code>  public class MyPanel extends JPanel{ private final Dimension dim = new Dimension(500,500); @Override public Dimension getPreferredSize(){ return new Dimension(dim); } public static void main(String args[]){ JComponent component = new MyPanel(); component.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(400,400)); System.out.println(component.getPreferredSize()); }} public class MyPanel extends JPanel{ private Dimension dim = null; @Override public Dimension getPreferredSize(){ if(dim == null) return super.getPreferredSize(); return new Dimension(dim); } @Override public void setPrefferedSize(Dimension dimension){ if(dim == null) dim = new Dimension(500,500); super.setPreferredSize(this.dim); // } public static void main(String args[]){ JComponent component = new MyPanel(); component.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(400,400)); System.out.println(component.getPreferredSize()); }}",Overriding getPreferredSize() breaks LSP

json string to Java object with Jackson," This is probably one of those questions where the title says it all.I am quite fascinated by the ObjectMapper's readValue(file, class) method, found within the Jackson library which reads a JSON string from a file and assigns it to an object.I'm curious if this is possible to do by simply getting JSON from a string and applying it to an object.Some sort of alternative readValue() method, which takes a String, instead of a file, and assigns it to an object?For instance, while the default readValue(file, class) method looks like this: I was wondering if there was some method in Jackson, which allowed the following: The second example takes a string and an object of a class while the first one takes a file and an object of a class.I just want to cut out the middle man, in this case, the file.Is this doable or does no such method exist within the constraints of Jackson? <code>  ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();Student student = mapper.readValue(""C:\\student.json"", Student.class); ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();Student student = mapper.readValue(""{\""id\"":100,\""firstName\"":\""Adam\""}"", Student.class);",JSON string to Java object with Jackson

Guava ImmutableMap Builder," I've been using Guava's ImmutableMap with a Builder for awhile without giving much thought to how/why it works. I've been using the builder in the way described by the Javadoc: I've also seen examples elsewhere on SO of this syntax: Both seem to produce the exact same result.A quick glance at the ImmutableMap source shows that the static builder() call in the 2nd example returns: new Builder<K, V>()There doesn't appear to be any functional difference between the two methods. Is there any difference under the hood? Any reason to prefer one or the other?EDIT: Adding bytecode difference.The bytecode generated is almost identical except for one line:Method 1(Builder<K,V>): Method 2:(<K,V>builder()) After that they're pretty much the same, the first line being different makes sense given the source differences, but I'm not sure why the first one calls dup and the second doesn't. <code>  ImmutableMap<String, Integer> WORD_TO_INT = new ImmutableMap.Builder<String, Integer>() .put(""one"", 1) .put(""two"", 2) .put(""three"", 3) .build(); ImmutableMap<String,Integer> myMap = ImmutableMap.<String, Integer>builder() .put(""one"", 1) .put(""two"", 2) .put(""three"", 3) .build(); static {}; 0 new com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap$Builder [12] 3 dup 4 invokespecial com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap$Builder() [14] 7 ldc <String ""key1""> [17] ........ static {}; 0 invokestatic com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap.builder() : com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap$Builder [12] 3 ldc <String ""key1""> [18] ........",Guava ImmutableMap Builder syntax

NumberFormatException parsing?," I know this probably isn't the most efficient way of coding this but it's what I have so far and it works up until the numbers get really big. The code should read 2 numbers from a file for example ""052"" and ""61"". It should then sort the first number from greatest to least to make the number as large as possible and the second number from least to greatest to make it as small as possible. (520 & 16) Then it prints the difference of the two, in this case: 504. Two of the numbers are ""3827367453723784675745843783623672348745389734268374687"" and ""1682761482512674172712635416571265716235471625176235741"". The sorting of the numbers from greatest to least and least to greatest works fine, but when I try to parse it into an integer a NumberFormatException is thrown. I figured because the number was too large to be stored into an int so I tried parsing into a Long but that resulted in the same error. What I did was read the numbers as Strings then made a String array storing each number in a separate index. Then I made an int array where I pretty much had the same array except in integer form instead of a String. I then sorted the int arrays. Then I created another String to store the new sorted numbers, then I tried to parse that String and that's where the exception is thrown.Any suggestions?  <code>  import java.io.*; import java.util.*; import java.text.*; import static java.lang.System.*; public class BigDif { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { Scanner scan = new Scanner (new File (""BigDif.dat"")); int numRuns = scan.nextInt(); scan.nextLine(); for (int i = 0; i < numRuns; i++) { String firstNum = scan.nextLine(); String secondNum = scan.nextLine(); String[] firstNum2 = new String[firstNum.length()]; String[] secondNum2 = new String[secondNum.length()]; int[] firstNum3 = new int[firstNum.length()]; int[] secondNum3 = new int[secondNum.length()]; int big = 0; int notBig = 0; String firstNum4 = null; String secondNum4 = null; int firstNum5 = 0; int secondNum5 = 0; for (int j = 0; j < firstNum.length(); j++) { firstNum2[j] = Character.toString(firstNum.charAt(j)); } for (int j = 0; j < secondNum.length(); j++) { secondNum2[j] = Character.toString(secondNum.charAt(j)); } for (int j = 0; j < firstNum2.length; j++) { firstNum3[j] = Integer.parseInt(firstNum2[j]); secondNum3[j] = Integer.parseInt(secondNum2[j]); } Arrays.sort(firstNum3); Arrays.sort(secondNum3); for (int m = 0; m < firstNum3.length; m++) { if (m == 0) firstNum4 = (Integer.toString(firstNum3[m])); else firstNum4 = (Integer.toString(firstNum3[m]))+ firstNum4; } for (int m = 0; m < secondNum3.length; m++) { if (m == 0) secondNum4 = (Integer.toString(secondNum3[m])); else secondNum4 += (Integer.toString(secondNum3[m])); } firstNum5 = Integer.parseInt(firstNum4); //the exception is thrown here secondNum5 = Integer.parseInt(secondNum4); if (firstNum5 >= secondNum5) { big = firstNum5; notBig = secondNum5; } else { big = secondNum5; notBig = firstNum5; } out.println(big - notBig); } } } ",NumberFormatException while parsing large numbers?

My question is more of from the architectural perspective and not completely technical.

Java - caught vs uncaught Exception - tell from code alone?," Is it possible to tell if an exception class is a checked or unchecked just by looking at the code? I always thought that if it extended Exception, it was checked, but then RuntimeException extends Exception and that is unchecked. RuntimeException may be the only class that bends that rule of thumb, with other unchecked exceptions having to extend Throwable if not extending RuntimeException. However, I do not see how RuntimeException differs from Exception. I wonder if the difference is defined inside the interpreter itself? <code> ",Java - checked vs unchecked Exception - tell from code alone?

Is it good programming to have a return type of exception?," I ran into an odd situation during a use case on a project: ESQL is calling a java method, sending it a String input parameter which the method will unmarshal, apply some logic, and then store useful info from the unmarshalled object. So, the method must either throw a JAXBException, or use a try catch in order to handle the possible exceptions.The problem with this is, that ESQL cannot invoke a java method which includes a throws in the signature. BUT, we want any errors to fall through back to the previously calling MBNode so it can be handled appropriately there, so then trycatch is out of the picture.It struck me that hey, is it not possible to return a type of Exception when we encounter an issue, and null if not? So I wrote a simple method doing so, and though I didn't get any warnings or errors, it seemed just wrong to me in the sense of good programming.For example: But I just get a terrible feeling about doing anything this way.I'm open to any thoughts or different solutions to this, especially if there's a way around the ESQL signature issue.UPDATE:Adding reference as to why the ESQL procedure cannot call a java method with a throws clause in the signature.Excerpt from This link under the CREATE PROCEDURE statement section:""Any Java method that you want to invoke must have the following basic signature: public static (< 0 - N parameters>) where must be in the list of Java IN data types in the table in ESQL to Java data type mapping (excluding the REFERENCE type, which is not permitted as a return value), or the Java void data type. The parameter data types must also be in the ESQL to Java data type mapping table.

Java Debug Interface and Lambdas," I am having some problems updating a debugger to work with Java 8. Consider the following program for example: As expected, Java 8 compiles the lambda to something like this: This looks pretty much like normal code. However, I am trying to use the Java Debugger Interface (JDI) to intercept every step of the program. The fist thing that goes wrong is when I handle the ClassPrepareEvent event corresponding to the lambda class. Asking the event.referenceType() gives me something like Lam$$Lambda$1.1464642111 which is cool. But then calling .allLineLocations() on the .referenceType() gives a AbsentInformationException, which seems at odds with the LineNumberTable in the compiled file.It looks like stepping through lambda bodies in Java 8 is possible. But does anyone know how it can be done in JDI?Updates: when .allLineLocations is called on the Lam class, it does reflect all of these line numbers. when a JDI Event happens within the lambda class (e.g. from stepping), the .sourceName() of the location throws an AbsentInformationExceptionit looks like jdk.internal.org.objectweb.asm.* is doing a bunch of stuff related to copying the lambdaI'm not sure if the map from source lines to bytecodes is kept in Java, or in the JDISo my working hypothesis is that when the lambda's class is created at runtime, the JDI needs to do something to recognize that the new class's bytecode is coming from the old class's bytecode (which is in turn coming from from Lam.java). I don't know enough about the internal representation of java.lang.Class or com.sun.jdi.ClassType to know where to begin.Why am I trying to do this:to update the Java Visualizer to work with lambdas <code>  public class Lam { public static void main(String[] args) { java.util.function.Function<Integer, Integer> square = x -> { int result = 0; for (int i=0; i<x; i++) result++; return result; }; System.out.println(square.apply(5)); }} > javap -c -p -v -s -constants LamClassfile Lam.class... private static java.lang.Integer lambda$main$0(java.lang.Integer);...Code: stack=2, locals=3, args_size=1 0: iconst_0 1: istore_1...LineNumberTable: line 5: 0 line 6: 2 line 7: 4 line 9: 12 line 8: 15 line 10: 21","Java Debug Interface, Lambdas and Line Numbers"

JDK8 with -source 1.7," I have the following class. It just compiles fine. And it fails with -source 1.7. Is this normal? It seems that javac doesn't understand JDK classes with -source other than 1.8.According to javac, javac still supports various -source release options as previous releases did.SupplementI already know the JSR 310: Date and Time API is only available in Java 8.

why Integer in java is immutable," I know Integers are immutable in Java. But why it is designed this way?I went through other answers before asking this question:Is Integer Immutablei++ still working for immutable Integer in Java?Why are Java wrapper classes immutable?But I couldn't find the use case which mandates the Integer to be immutable.Are there any technical reasons like there are for String?String is used as parameter in network connection, database URLs etc. It could easily be compromised if it was mutable.To support StringPool facility.To support class loading mechanism in which Strings are used as arguments. String being mutable results in a wrong class being loaded.I understand there are wrappers like AtomicInteger for mutable. UPDATE:From the conversation, there is no universal reason that could mandate the Integers being immutable. However by doing immutable it provides some bonus as mentioned in the answers.Such as this quote from Andrey possibility to cache. Others are reducing global state easier multithreading <code> ",Why are Integers immutable in Java?

Please give the reason why this is not happening or if i am missing some rule. <code>  public class aman { void m(double a , int b, int c) { System.out.println(""second""); } void m(float a , int b, double c) { System.out.println(""first""); } public static void main(String[] args) { aman obj = new aman(); obj.m(23, 12, 1); }}","When using overloading with type promotion, why method calling is ambiguous?"
For Java experts: Why does this assignment cause NPE?," On the 4th call to method() I get a NullPointerException thrown on the indicated line inside method(). If I refactor that line from to I get no NullPointerException and the method behaves as it should. The question is: WHY??It looks to me like the compiler expects the result of the ? operator to be long so that it is automatically unboxing (demoting from Long to long) the result of the call to map.get(thing) (which may return null and therefore throw a NullPointerException). IMHO it should be expecting the result of the ? operator to be Long and autoboxing (promoting long to Long) thing.value instead.Even better, if I refactor this statement: to this (casting long to Long explicitly): my IDE (IntelliJ) says that the cast is redundant, but the compiled code works as expected and does not throw a NullPointerException! :-D <code>  public class Npe { static class Thing { long value; } public static Map<Thing, Long> map; public static void main(String[] args) { Thing thing = new Thing(); method(null); // returns -1 method(thing); // returns 0 map = new HashMap<Thing, Long>(); method(null); // returns -1 method(thing); // NullPointerException thrown inside this method call } public static long method(Thing thing) { if (thing == null) { return -1; } Long v = (map == null) ? thing.value : map.get(thing); // NPE here if (v == null) { v = thing.value; } return v; }} Long v = (map == null) ? thing.value : map.get(thing); Long v;if (map == null) { v = thing.value;} else { v = map.get(thing);} Long v = (map == null) ? thing.value : map.get(thing); Long v = (map == null) ? (Long)thing.value : map.get(thing);",Why does this assignment cause NPE?

Find instance-id or public IP of AWS EC2 instance Java SDK," I have an AWS EC2 instance deployed, and I need to find out its public IP. Howver, to know that I must first know the instance-id of my instance.Objective:I have a Java code running in my instance, and I want that code figure out the current IP or Instance-ID of the instance where it is being run.After reading Amazon documentation I came up with a Java method that returns the IP of all instances, but this is not what I want, I want a method that returns only the instance-id or the public IP address of the running instance. In this code I have an array with the instance-ids of all active instances, but I do not know if they are ""me"" or not.

Expected Behavior of HttpURLConnection for URL with Revoked SSL Certificate?," We're going to have a bumper crop of revoked SSL certificates, courtesy of heartbleed. When I saw that Chrome on Android apparently ignores revoked SSL certificates, I wondered what the behavior would be when requesting in Java a Web resource from a server, where we get a revoked SSL certificate.What I hoped for was a crash with some sort of SSLHandshakeException.What I am seeing is a successful connection, but downloading no data -- reading from getInputStream() returns a length of -1. This is tested using https://revoked.grc.com/ as my test site, which will return an explanatory page if you download it ignoring certificate errors (e.g., via wget -no-check-certificate). I have tried 4.4, 4.3, and 2.3 emulators, with the same results.Is there a specified behavior for the Java VM? I doubt that there is an Android-specific specification, but if Android's actual behavior differs from a Java specification, I can work to get the differences clarified as either being bugs or missing documentation. <code> ",Behavior of HttpURLConnection for URL with Revoked SSL Certificate?

The one with the upper case d seems to be more likely to be read wrong --> ""D"" could be read as ""0"" or so. <code>  Double d = 1d; Double d = 1D; Double d = 1.; Double d = 1.0; Double d = 1.0d; Double d = 1.0D; Long l = 1l; Long l = 1L;",Coding conventions for number literal suffix?
An Exception while migrating from jersey 1.x to jersey 2.x ( 2.8 )," I developed a web service application which was working fine with jersey 1.x ( 1.16 )I recently tried to migrate to latest stable jersey version 2.8I deleted all jersey jar files of v1.16 then I downloaded jersey jars of v2.8 from the link - https://jersey.java.net/download.htmlAs per documentation I came to know that, I should have latest servlet jar, servlet jar 2.5 or above, So I downloaded servlet-api-2.5.jar and added the same to /libs folder.I downloaded javax.ws.rs-api-2.0-m09.jar and added it to /libsI also added latest jettison v 1.3.3 to /libsBut I am getting exception when I run on tomcat7 as followsWhat are the exact steps to migrate from jersey 1.x to 2.x ? What is missing here ?My Web.xml looks as follows And the exception is - If I include configuration class by extending ResourceConfig classI get strange error as follows. Update - Solution to the problem 1> Add all the jar files given jaxrs-ri folder which you download as jersey 2.8 from the linkhttps://jersey.java.net/download.htmlAdd jar files from all the folders , ""lib"", ""ext"", ""api""2> Add the jar files listed in the below postCan't enable POJO based JSON binding support for Jackson in Jersey 2.0Now jersey 2.8 works perfectly .. <code>  <?xml

How do I make a Java class in one project visible in another project?," I have two Java projects called A and B. Both of them are web apps deployed as war files. I created them in Eclipse workspace separately. Project B uses a class in project A named MusicMapper. I added the project A to project B's build path in Eclipse as suggested in this post. So now project B can compile without any errors and the class MusicMapper can be seen in project B by importing it in project B: Everything seems to be fine before I launched the web app of project B. However, when I launched the project B and called the code that references class MusicMapper in project A, I got the following runtime error: So this error seems to be caused by unfound class com.projectA.MusicMapper which is imported from project A. Since I already added project A to project B build path and project B compiles fine without any errors, why does it report this error at runtime? Another approach I took was: I've also tried using the following Maven import in project B's pom.xml: where projectA.jar is the jar file I exported from project A. But it still gave me the same ClassNotFoundException. How can I make the class in project A usable by project B? It seems that neither of the two approaches I've tried works.  <code>  import com.projectA.MusicMapper; java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.projectA.MusicMapper <dependency> <groupId>com.projectA</groupId> <artifactId>projectA</artifactId> <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version> <scope>system</scope> <systemPath>/path/to/projectA.jar</systemPath> </dependency>",How to share code between two projects?
"NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException: no qualifying bean of type ... i defined, expected single matching bean but found 2"," We've been searching around a bit on both the internet and our paperback courses but can't seem to find a solution to our problem: To sketch some background information: we have to make a small website using java jsp pages and all, together with spring security and maven using a DB to get information and check for information.

How do we force Resource(controller) level transaction in Dropwizard?," In spring, we have @Transactional annotation which can be specified at Controller, so everything happens inside a controller method is treated as one transaction. However in dropwizard, we can have transaction at a DAO level by implementing Transactional<DAOclass>. But if I use two DAOs in a single resource method, it is treated as two different transactions. Say I have two DAOs Dao1.java Dao2.java ArticleResource.java In the above example, dao1 and dao2 have two different transactions. But I need everthing under a single transactionSo is there any way of specifying transactional boundaries at Resource level? <code>  public abstract class Dao1 implements Transactional<Dao1>{ @sqlQuery(//somequery) public abstract void insertIntoArticles(); } public abstract class Dao2 implements Transactional<Dao2>{ @sqlQuery(//somequery) public abstract void insertIntoArticlesChildren(); } @POST @PATH(""/articles"") public void insertArticleAndItsChildren(Integer articleId){ try{ dao1.begin(); dao2.begin(); dao1.insertIntoArticles(); dao2.insertIntoArticlesChildren(); dao1.commit(); dao2.commit(); }catch(Exception e){ dao1.rollback(); dao2.rollback(); }}",How do we force Resource(controller) level transaction in Dropwizard with jdbi?

Amazon sns & sqs messagesvia http using java, I have 2 different systems (A an B) that communicates using amazon sqs.System A sends messages to system B.Currently system B gets the messages using a separated thread that starts when the server goes up.Here is the run method: Looking at this code I have a feeling it is not efficient since it uses a busy waiting loop.I would expect to get the messages using some sort of push mechanism.Reading a bit about amazon sqs and sns this seems possible using http (server B can expose servlets for that) but still I'm a bit confused. Which one (sns or sqs) should provide me this ability (pushing a message to server B)?What is the easiest way of doing it (any reference to code)? <code>  @Overridepublic void run() { while (true) { ReceiveMessageRequest receiveMessageRequest = new ReceiveMessageRequest(myQueueUrl); try { receiveMessageRequest.setWaitTimeSeconds(1); List<Message> messages = sqs.receiveMessage(receiveMessageRequest).getMessages(); for (Message message : messages) { // process messages } } }},Amazon sns & sqs messages with java

Data Modelling with ORM - database first or classes first?," I'm attempting to use Sparx Enterprise Architect to design a data model that will end up in a MySQL database.My first approach was a Data Model diagram, which can be used to generate DDL (or the other way round by reverse engineering).This works quite well but a colleague pointed out a snag: We're intending to use an ORM (almost certainly Hibernate) to map tables to Java classes. His comment was a ""database first"" approach would preclude the use of good OO techniques such as inheritance.This seems a good point but I'm wondering if there are any limitations. If I started from scratch with a Class Diagram instead of a Data Model diagram, would there be a way of including all necessary Hibernate annotations, config etc. in this model? And if I later needed to model database-specific functionality such as constraints, triggers etc. would all this be possible in the model given that a Class Diagram isn't really aimed at this type of thing? <code> ",ORM modeling: Database first vs classes first

Options for Programatically Adding Certificates to Java KeyStore," I was getting an SSL Handshake Exception error: PKIX ""path does not chain"" (described here).I fixed it by importing a certificate chain using openssl:openssl s_client -host www.envmgr.com -port 443 -showcerts > cert_chain.crtand installed it into my JDK's keystore: Well this works. Hooray. The problem is we'll be putting our application up on a cloud server like rackspace or AWS and I think there is a good chance that we won't have access to modify the keystore of the JVM to add this chain.I thought, ""no problem, I'll just add this certificate chain to the keystore programmatically"" so I removed it from my JVM: and added this code: But when I run it, the PKIX error reappears. Is the above code not equivalent to keytool -import? I feel like I'm either adding certificates to the KeyStore incorrectly, or I'm not installing the Keystore into the TrustManager in the right way.FYI: I am also attempting to address this issue by implementing an X509TrustManager. <code>  keytool -import -alias envmgrchain -file cert_chain.crt -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit keytool -delete -alias envmgrchain -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit KeyStore trustStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType()); //Create an empty keystore that we can load certificate into trustStore.load(null); InputStream fis = new FileInputStream(""cert_chain.crt""); BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis); CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X.509""); while(bis.available()>0) { Collection<? extends Certificate> certs = cf.generateCertificates(bis); Iterator<? extends Certificate> iter = certs.iterator(); //Add each cert in the chain one at a time for(int i=0; i<certs.size(); i++) { Certificate cert = iter.next(); String alias = ""chaincert""+((i>0)?i:""""); trustStore.setCertificateEntry(alias, cert); } } bis.close(); fis.close();//Add custom keystore to TrustManager TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm()); tmf.init(trustStore); SSLContext ctx = SSLContext.getInstance(""TLSv1""); ctx.init(null, tmf.getTrustManagers(), null);",Options for Programmatically Adding Certificates to Java KeyStore

This web application is distributed over several (virtual and physical) nodes, connected to a central DBMS (MySQL in this case, but again, this should not limit the solution...) and able to handle some 1000s of users, serving pages, doing stuff, just as you'd expect from your average web-based information system.Now, there are some tasks which affect a larger portion of data and the system should be optimized to carry out these tasks reasonably fast. (Faster than processing everything sequentially, that is). So I'd make the task parallel and distribute it over several (or all) nodes:(Note: the data portions which are processed are independent, so there are no database or locking conflicts here).The problem is, I'd like the (whole) task to be transactional. So if one of the parallel subtasks fails, I'd like to have all other tasks rolled back as a result. Otherwise the system would be in a potentially inconsistent state from a domain perspective.Current implementationAs I said, the current implementation uses Tomcat and MySQL. The nodes use JMS to communicate (so there is a JMS server to which a dispatcher sends a message for each subtask; and executors take tasks from the message queue, execute them, and post the results to a result queue from which the dispatcher collects the results. The dispatcher blocks and waits for all results to come in and if anything is fine, it terminates with an OK status.The problem here is that all the executors have their own local transaction context, so the picture would look like this:If for some reason one of the subtasks fails, the local transaction is rolled back and the dispatcher gets an error result. (There is some failsafe mechanism here, which tries to repeat the failed transaction, but let's assume for some reason, the one task cannot be completed).The problem is that the system now is in a state where all transactions but one is already committed and completed. And because I cannot get the one final transaction to finish successfully, I cannot get out of this state. Possible solutionsThese are the thoughts which I have followed so far:I could somehow implement a domain-specific rollback mechanism myself. Because the distributor knows which tasks have been carried out, it could revert the effects explicitly (e.g. storing old values somewhere and revert already committed values back to the previous values). Of course, in this case, I must guarantee that no other process changes something in between, so I'd also have to set the system to a read-only state, as long as the big operation is running.More or less, I'd need to simulate a transaction in business logic ...I could choose not to parallelize and do everything on a single node in one big transaction (but as stated at the beginning, I need to speed up processing, so this is not an option...)I have tried to find out about XATransactions or distributed transactions in general, but this seems to be an advanced Java EE feature, which is not implemented in all Java EE servers, and which would not really solve that basic problem, because there does not seem to be a way to transfer a transaction context over to a remote node in an asynchronous call. (e.g. section 4.5.3 of EJB Specification 3.1: ""Client transaction context does not propagate with an asynchronous method invocation. From the Bean Developers view, there is never a transaction context flowing in from the client."")The QuestionAm I overlooking something? Is it not possible to distribute a task asynchronously over several nodes and at the same time have a (shared) transactional state which can be rolled back as a whole?Thanks for any pointers, hints, propositions ... <code> ",Parallel and Transactional Processing in Java (Java EE)
not annotated method overrides method annotated with @notnull," I'm implementing a custom data structure that gives me some properties of sets and other properties of lists. For most of the implemented methods though, I get this weird warning in IntelliJ IDEA on Java 7: Not annotated method overrides method annotated with @NotNullEDIT: The code below isn't relevant to the issue, but part of the original question. This warning shows up because of a bug in IntelliJ. See the answer to (hopefully) resolve your issue.I haven't been able to find anything relevant about it and I'm not sure if I'm actually missing some sort of check, but I've looked through the source of both ArrayList and the List interface and can't see what this warning is actually about. It's on every implemented method that references the list field. Here's a snippet of the class I've made: EDIT: I have these additional constructors in the class: <code>  public class ListHashSet<T> implements List<T>, Set<T> {private ArrayList<T> list;private HashSet<T> set;/** * Constructs a new, empty list hash set with the specified initial * capacity and load factor. * * @param initialCapacity the initial capacity of the list hash set * @param loadFactor the load factor of the list hash set * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the initial capacity is less * than zero, or if the load factor is nonpositive */public ListHashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor) { set = new HashSet<>(initialCapacity, loadFactor); list = new ArrayList<>(initialCapacity);}.../** * The Object array representation of this collection * @return an Object array in insertion order */@Overridepublic Object[] toArray() { // warning is on this line for the toArray() method return list.toArray();} public ListHashSet(int initialCapacity) { this(initialCapacity, .75f);}public ListHashSet() { this(16, .75f);}",Not annotated method overrides method annotated with @NotNull

Java algorithm for find intersection between interval," I have a time interval like this: and I have more list of time point, with different length, for example: where in t1 [3,6] is the first interval, [6,9] the second and so on.Same thing for t2 and other list.Now I need to save the list, and the specific interval, that intersect with first time interval.

How to define which property ListView should use to render.," I have a java bean object list which I would like to display in ListView control. By default ListView uses toString method.How can I define which property to use for rendering in ListView? I want to achieve same functionality as in TableView can be achieved by PropertyValueFactory in this code: Edit It looks like there is no easy(out of the box) solution. Based on code from James_D I created generic class to deal with the problem. It wraps PropertyValueFactory - note that PropertyValueFactory firstly looks for method [NAME]Property() trying to get observable, only when it is not found it tries to access standard bean properties. Usage: <code>  @FXMLprivate TableView<Person> mainTableView;//...TableColumn<Person,String> personColumn = new TableColumn<>(""Name"");ListpersonColumn.setCellValueFactory(new PropertyValueFactory(""name""));mainTableView.getColumns().add(personColumn); public class PropertyValueFactoryWrapperCellFactory<T> implements Callback<ListView<T>, ListCell<T>> { private final PropertyValueFactory<T, String> pvf; public PropertyValueFactoryWrapperCellFactory(String propertyName) { super(); pvf = new PropertyValueFactory(propertyName); } @Override public ListCell<T> call(ListView<T> param) { return new ListCell<T>() { @Override public void updateItem(T item, boolean empty) { super.updateItem(item, empty); textProperty().unbind(); if (item == null) { return; } TableColumn.CellDataFeatures<T, String> cdf = new TableColumn.CellDataFeatures<>(null, null, item); textProperty().bind(pvf.call(cdf)); } }; }} @FXMLprivate ListView<Person> mainListView;//...mainListView.setCellFactory(new PropertyValueFactoryWrapperCellFactory(""name""));",How to define which property ListView should use to render
Differences between Java 8 Date Time API and Joda Time," I know there are questions relating to java.util.Date and Joda-Time.

Change to Hashmap hash function in Java 8," In java 8 java.util.Hashmap I noticed a change from: to: It appears from the code that the new function is a simpler XOR of the lower 16 bits with the upper 16 leaving the upper 16 bits unchanged, as opposed to several different shifts in the previous implementation, and from the comments that this is less effective at allocating the results of hash functions with a high number of collisions in lower bits to different buckets, but saves CPU cycles by having to do less operations.The only thing I saw in the release notes was the change from linked lists to balanced trees to store colliding keys (which I thought might have changed the amount of time it made sense to spend calculating a good hash), I was specifically interested in seeing if there was any expected performance impact from this change on large hash maps. Is there any information about this change, or does anyone with a better knowledge of hash functions have an idea of what the implications of this change might be (if any, perhaps I just misunderstood the code) and if there was any need to generate hash codes in a different way to maintain performance when moving to Java 8? <code>  static int hash(int h) { h ^= (h >>> 20) ^ (h >>> 12); return h ^ (h >>> 7) ^ (h >>> 4); static final int hash(Object key) { int h; return (key == null) ? 0 : (h = key.hashCode()) ^ (h >>> 16);",Change to HashMap hash function in Java 8

Java: int to long assign," I have been trying this int and long conversion where I have tried assigning an int variable to a long variable. The code is as follows: So, while printing j, it simply gave an output of 1024. But while printing k, it showed an overflow (k=0). I sorted out this problem by using this technique, where I have explicitly casted each i to long. i.e. Now, it showed correct values of both j and k.So, I wanted to know why is this needed to cast int in the second case but not in the first one. k, being a long can retain this value after this heavy assignment. But, why it is not been correctly assigned? <code>  public static void main(String []args){ int i = 1024; long j = i; long k = i*i*i*i; System.out.println(""j= "" +j+ "", k= "" +k);} public static void main(String []args){ int i = 1024; long j = i; long k = ((long)i)*((long)i)*((long)i)*((long)i); System.out.println(""j= "" +j+ "", k= "" +k);}",int to long assignment

Strange runtime perfomance deterioration / JIT's fault?," So I wanted to benchmark some basic java functionality to add some imformation to this question: What is the gain from declaring a method as static.I know writing benchmarks is sometimes not easy but what happens here I cannot explain.Please note that I'm not interessted in how to fix this but on why this happens*The Test class: I was expecting the first loop to be warmup and the following loops to be faster.Running this in Eclipse gave those strange results: So wtf? It got slower. To crosscheck I run the same code with java/c 7: So here only the static calls got slower for the following loops.

Why doesn't Stack Overflow always occur?," I'm currently studying Java and, as a part of my learning, I attempted to intentionally induce a stack overflow to see what it would do.I did some boundary testing and, interestingly, I discovered that if I execute the following code it will only sporadically cause an error. Sometimes it will run without any problems. My questions are as follows:What might be causing my stack size to vary between executions of this very simple example?These days, does a stack overflow always occur due to poor code design (i.e. infinite recursion, excessively large primitives, etc.) or are there real world scenarios where the stack is still a technical limitation?This one may seem obvious but.. does increasing the physical memory of a system also increase the size of the stack? <code>  public class SO{ public static void main(String[] args) { ohno(0); } public static void ohno(int a) { System.out.println(a); if (a != 11413) ohno(a+1); }}",Why doesn't a stack overflow always occur?

How to guarantee atomic move of a file in Java?," In one of my projects I have concurrent write access to one single file within one JRE and want to handle that by first writing to a temporary file and afterwards moving that temp file to the target using an atomic move. I don't care about the order of the write access or such, all I need to guarantee is that any given time the single file is usable. I'm already aware of Files.move and such, my problem is that I had a look at at least one implementation for that method and it raised some doubts about if implementations really guarantee atomic moves. Please look at the following code:Files.move on GrepCode for OpenJDK The problem is that the option ATOMIC_MOVE is not considered in all cases, but the location of the source and target path is the only thing that matters in the first place. That's not what I want and how I understand the documentation: If the move cannot be performed as an atomic file system operation then AtomicMoveNotSupportedException is thrown. This can arise, for example, when the target location is on a different FileStore and would require that the file be copied, or target location is associated with a different provider to this object.The above code clearly violates that documentation because it falls back to a copy-delete-strategy without recognizing ATOMIC_MOVE at all. An exception would be perfectly OK in my case, because with that a hoster of our service could change his setup to use only one filesystem which supports atomic moves, as that's what we expect in the system requirements anyway. What I don't want to deal with is things silently failing just because an implementation uses a copy-delete-strategy which may result in data corruption in the target file. So, from my understanding it is simply not safe to rely on Files.move for atomic operations, because it doesn't always fail if those are not supported, but implementations may fall back to a copy-delete-strategy.Is such behaviour a bug in the implementation and needs to get filed or does the documentation allow such behaviour and I'm understanding it wrong? Does it make any difference at all if I now already know that such maybe broken implementations are used out there? I would need to synchronize the write access on my own in that case... <code>  1342 FileSystemProvider provider = provider(source);1343 if (provider(target) == provider) {1344 // same provider1345 provider.move(source, target, options);1346 } else {1347 // different providers1348 CopyMoveHelper.moveToForeignTarget(source, target, options);1349 }",How to guarantee atomic move or exception of a file in Java?
Finding if any string in a collection contains another string," I'm trying to improve the performance of a Java-function I have that is determining whether a given search string contains >0 of the strings in a collection. This could look like premature optimization but the function is called A LOT so any speed up would be very beneficial. The code currently looks like this: The list typically has about 30 elements and the same collection is reused a lot between each call.The code above is a pretty straightforward linear search. I don't think it can be significantly improved unless we change the data structure to make it better than O(n). Are there any data structures that would enable me to do that? <code>  public static boolean containsAny(String searchString, List<String> searchCollection) { int size = searchCollection.size(); for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { String stringInCollection = searchCollection.get(i); if (!Util.isNullOrEmpty(stringInCollection)) { // This is a performance optimization of contains. if (searchString.indexOf(stringInCollection, 0) > -1) { return true; } } } return false;}",Finding if a string contains any string in a collection
"Why is ""while (i++ < n) {}"" significantly slower than ""while (++i < n) {}"" in Java?"," Apparently on my Windows 8 laptop with HotSpot JDK 1.7.0_45 (with all compiler/VM options set to default), the below loop is at least 2 orders of magnitude faster (~10 ms vs. ~5000 ms) than: I happened to notice this problem while writing a loop to evaluate another irrelevant performance issue. And the difference between ++i < n and i++ < n was huge enough to significantly influence the result.If we look at the bytecode, the loop body of the faster version is: And for the slower version: So for ++i < n, it first increments local variable i by 1 and then push it onto the operand stack while i++ < n does those 2 steps in reverse order. But that doesn't seem to explain why the former is much faster. Is there any temp copy involved in the latter case? Or is it something beyond the bytecode (VM implementation, hardware, etc.) that should be responsible for the performance difference?I've read some other discussion regarding ++i and i++ (not exhaustively though), but didn't find any answer that is Java-specific and directly related to the case where ++i or i++ is involved in a value comparison. <code>  final int n = Integer.MAX_VALUE;int i = 0;while (++i < n) {} final int n = Integer.MAX_VALUE;int i = 0;while (i++ < n) {} iinciloadldcif_icmplt iloadiincldcif_icmplt","Why is ""while (i++ < n) {}"" significantly slower than ""while (++i < n) {}"""

what hibernate proxy object contains?," All I could gather from Google is that:Hibernate uses a proxy object to implement lazy loading.When we request to load the Object from the database, and the fetched Object has a reference to another concrete object, Hibernate returns a proxy instead of the concrete associated object.Hibernate creates a proxy object using bytecode instrumentation (provided by javassist). Hibernate creates a subclass of our entity class at runtime using the code generation library and replaces the actual object with the newly created proxy.So, what exactly does the Proxy object contain? Does it contain a skeleton object reference object with only the id field set? Others field will be set when we call the get method? Does the Proxy object contain the JDBC statement to fetch all data required to fully populate the referenced object.Is there something else I might be missing?I am not asking for spoon feeding but if you can provide any link with information that would be great.Any correction to above description will also be welcomed.Example. When we try to load the Person object, Hibernate will subclass Person class like: and return a ProxyPerson object. Object of ProxyPerson will have a value for id and name but proxy for Address.Am I correct?What can I expect from adding a toString() method on the proxy object? <code>  class Address { String city; String country;}class Person{ int id; String name; Address address;} class ProxyPerson extends Person { int id; String name; Address proxyCGLIBObject;}",What does the Hibernate proxy object contain?

But, if I put the line which sets the frame backfround to 0f,0f,0f,0f (transparent) in comments and then activate, the whole screen becomes grey and I keep tracking all the mouse motions just as I desired (I just can't see anything).I really do not understand why this happens, haven't seen related issues around, nor in this related javadoc, which discusses MouseMotion events.This is the code: <code>  public class MouseMotionDetection extends JPanel implements MouseMotionListener{public MouseMotionDetection(Region tableRegion, Observer observer){ addMouseMotionListener(this); setBackground(new Color(0f,0f,0f,0f)); JFrame frame = new JFrame(); frame.setUndecorated(true); Dimension screenSize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize(); frame.setSize(screenSize); frame.setBackground(new Color(0f,0f,0f,0f)); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE); frame.setAlwaysOnTop(true); JComponent contentPane = this; contentPane.setOpaque(true); frame.getContentPane().add(contentPane, BorderLayout.CENTER); frame.setVisible(true);}@Overridepublic void mouseDragged(MouseEvent arg0) {}@Overridepublic void mouseMoved(MouseEvent arg0) { System.out.println(""mouse movement detected"");}",Detecting mouse movement on screen
Lambda Parameters," I am having trouble understanding the syntax for a method reference, where there are two parameters a and b, and the reference is to a method of a on b.For example I understand how is equivalent to because in that case the lambda parameters match the method call parameters (o1, o2).Howevever for this lambda my IDE tells me that is equivalent to: and I am not finding a rule for replacing that syntax: a.method(b) with a method reference.For example, what if there are three or more parameters to the lambda?

Exception self supression error in try-with-resources not occuring from Eclipse," I have come across a troubling situation where I expect Java to complain (via an IllegalArgumentException from Throwable.addSuppressed) about throwing the same exception twice, once from within a try-with-resources block and once from the AutoCloseable class's close() routine. I have created a simple test case below which highlights the problem.I am running JDK 1.7.0_65 with the following code: When I compile and run the code above via the command line I get the expected result, an error indicating I have tried to self-suppress and exception: However, when I build and run the same code from Eclipse I do not get the same result, I get the following: I removed the .class path after building from the command line to ensure that Eclipse rebuilt it. Running from a debugger I noticed that from Eclipse the code never enters java.lang.Throwable.addSuppressed().Interestingly, if I build the class from Eclipse, then run it from the command line I DO NOT SEE the self suppression error. Similarly if I build the class from the command line and run it from Eclipse (without building from Eclipse) then I DO SEE the error. This suggests that it is something funny about how eclipse is building the class.I would like to know how to ensure Eclipse can build the class in such a way that I do get the error, because for my purposes it is an error and I want to be able to detect it when I build and run from Eclipse. <code>  public class TestDoubleThrow { public static void main(String[] args) { class TestA implements AutoCloseable { RuntimeException e; public TestA(RuntimeException e) { this.e = e; } @Override public void close() { throw e; } } RuntimeException e = new RuntimeException(""My Exception""); try (TestA A = new TestA(e)) { throw e; } }} [coreys terminal]$ java TestDoubleThrow.java ; java TestDoubleThrowException in thread ""main"" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Self-suppression not permitted at java.lang.Throwable.addSuppressed(Throwable.java:1043) at TestDoubleThrow.main(TestDoubleThrow.java:12)Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: My Exception at TestDoubleThrow.main(TestDoubleThrow.java:9) Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.RuntimeException: My Exception at TestDoubleThrow.main(TestDoubleThrow.java:9)",Exception self suppression error in try-with-resources not occuring from Eclipse

Calculate new coordinates on a circle with a certain degree," I'm trying to figure out how I could be able to calculate coordinates on a circle. For simplicity I made some images.That's the start with information I have. Now I need to calculate the new coordinates when for example the circle would turn 90 degrees to the right. Just like the next image:I need to calculate the coordinates of the new red dot. (I also need this with different degrees such as 20 degrees).To do this my plan was to do the following:Calculate the distance between the two pointsCalculate the degree between the north (up) and the given pointCalculate the new location with the degree (from a step back) + the degrees it needs to turn (in the images 90 degrees).My first step is: The part to calculate the new degrees is: And the last part to calculate the new location would be: However when I do these calculations with for example 0 degrees it still returns another value than the original coordinates.Any help would be appreciated!Edit for Philipp Jahoda:My values are: and my results are: As you can see, the degree is 0 so the point is not supposed to turn. It should keep the 490, 728 coordinates but it does not keep those. <code>  distance = Math.sqrt((point1.x-point2.x)*(point1.x-point2.x) + (point1.y-point2.y)*(point1.y-point2.y)) double theta = Math.atan2(targetPt.y - centerPt.y, targetPt.x - centerPt.x);theta += Math.PI/2.0; double x = mMiddleView.getX() + distance * Math.cos(Math.toRadians(theta));double y = mMiddleView.getY() + distance * Math.sin(Math.toRadians(theta)); distance +- 70, currentDegree = 0.PointF point = new PointF((float)mMiddleView.getX(), (float)mMiddleView.getY());PointF point2 = getPosition(point, (float) distance, currentDegree); center: PointF(490.0, 728.0) radius: 78.0 angle: 0.0new point: PointF(568.0, 728.0)",How to calculate position on a circle with a certain angle?
Unirest get full call," For debugging matters, I would like to get the request executed by Unirest-Java when presented with a set of options. How can I get this: From this: That is, how can I get the full HTTP request from a HttpRequest? I don't really know of a proxy to use, as the only one with which I could get SSL support working was Charles, and for some reason it won't pickup the java traffic. Other tools would choke on the SSL mainly because the server I need to talk to is flawed, using self-signed certificates and invalid hostnames. So I would gladly try a proxy, but it has to work under these conditions. Better would be to extract this information from Unirest/HTTPClient itself. I already tried building the HttpClient with .setInterceptorFirst( but I couldn't get the request body from the interceptor, only some of its headers. <code>  POST / HTTP/1.1Host: www.some.host.tldConnection: keep-aliveAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8field1=FIELD1&field2=FIELD2 HttpRequest request = Unirest.post(SOMEHOST_URL) .field(""field1"" , FIELD1) .field(""field2"", FIELD2) .getHttpRequest();",Get full HTTP request

How obfuscate project with Dagger 2.0 using Proguard?," I was happy to see google's fork of Dagger has been made available. (At the time of this writing, I realize that it is not ""released"" yet.) we have an android app which uses dagger heavily, although we do not use many of the more advanced features.We have a business requirement to obfuscate our code, so I have have attempted an upgrade to Dagger 2.0-SNAPSHOT in the hopes that the removal of runtime reflection from Dagger would make it possible to run obfuscation.. however I'm finding that reflection is still used in terms of string constants being used at runtime to load classes.Below is the relevent bits of my proguard.conf. As you can see I have turned off much of the obfuscation. This allows for some classes to be injected properly, however it still fails on injecting one paticular class.Here is the exception: Has anyone tried out proguard with Google's dagger fork yet? <code>  -dontpreverify-keepattributes *Annotation*,JavascriptInterface,SourceFile,LineNumberTable,Signature-verbose-optimizations !code/simplification/arithmetic,!field/*,!class/merging/*-ignorewarnings-keep public class * extends android.app.Activity-keep public class * extends android.app.Application-keep public class * extends android.app.Service-keep public class * extends android.app.Fragment-keep public class * extends android.content.BroadcastReceiver-keep public class * extends android.content.ContentProvider-keep public class * extends android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper-keep public class * extends android.preference.Preference-keep class android.support.v4.app.** { *; }-keep interface android.support.v4.app.** { *; }-keep public class * extends android.view.View { public <init>(android.content.Context); public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet); public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet, int); public void set*(...);}-keepclasseswithmembernames class * { native <methods>;}-keepclasseswithmembers class * { public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet);}-keepclasseswithmembers class * { public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet, int);}###### dagger 2.0 stuff-keep class dagger.** { *; }-keep interface dagger.** { *; }-keepnames class com.ourcompany.**-keep class **$$ModuleAdapter { *; }-keepnames class **$$InjectAdapter { *; }-keepclassmembers class * { @javax.inject.Inject <fields>; @javax.inject.Inject <init>(...);}-adaptclassstrings java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.ourcompany.mobile.ourapp/com.ourcompany.mobile.ourapp.MainActivity}: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to create binding for com.ourcompany.mobile.ourapp.LogMetricsHelperE/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2195)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2245)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.app.ActivityThread.access$800(ActivityThread.java:135)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1196)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:102)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:136)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5017)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:515)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:779)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:595)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to create binding for com.ourcompany.mobile.ourapp.LogMetricsHelperE/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at dagger.internal.Linker.linkRequested(Linker.java:147)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at dagger.ObjectGraph$DaggerObjectGraph.getInjectableTypeBinding(ObjectGraph.java:320)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at dagger.ObjectGraph$DaggerObjectGraph.inject(ObjectGraph.java:290)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at com.ourcompany.mobile.module.ScopedActionBarActivity.onCreate(ScopedActionBarActivity.java:20)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at com.ourcompany.mobile.ourapp.BaseActivity.onCreate(BaseActivity.java:68)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at com.ourcompany.mobile.ourapp.MainActivity.onCreate(MainActivity.java:146)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.app.Activity.performCreate(Activity.java:5231)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1087)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2159)E/AndroidRuntime( 7228): ... 11 more",How to successfully obfuscate project with Dagger 2.0 using Proguard?

Order of autmatically wrapped @Repeatable annotations," Before, I used to declare a wrapper annotation by hand, with an array, and then call it like so: Since I was making an array with the { ... } initializers, it was more than clear that the order was to be the same of the declaration when I accessed this method later via Reflection.However, when I use the new @Repeatable annotation from Java 8, do I have guarantee that the order will be kept?I declared a simple set of annotations: and run some tests with the most diverse scenarios: and everything seems to work flawlessly (when accessing via Reflection), but I would not like to rely on undocumented stuff. It seems obvious to me that that should be the case, but I can't find it anywhere! Can anyone shed a light on this? <code>  @Foos({ @Foo(0), @Foo(1), @Foo(2) })public void bar() {} public @interface Foos { Foo[] value();}@Repeatable(Foos.class)public @interface Foo { int value();} @Foo(0) @Foo(1) @Foo(2)public void bar1() {}@Foo(2)@Deprecated @Foo(5)@Foo(10)public void bar2() {}",Order of automatically wrapped @Repeatable annotations
How is adding 0.1 remains lossless?," I know the 0.1 decimal number cannot be represented exactly with a finite binary number (explanation), so double n = 0.1 will lose some precision and will not be exactly 0.1. On the other hand 0.5 can be represented exactly because it is 0.5 = 1/2 = 0.1b.Having said that it is understandable that adding 0.1 three times will not give exactly 0.3 so the following code prints false: But then how is it that adding 0.1 five times will give exactly 0.5? The following code prints true: If 0.1 cannot be represented exactly, how is it that adding it 5 times gives exactly 0.5 which can be represented precisely? <code>  double sum = 0, d = 0.1;for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) sum += d;System.out.println(sum == 0.3); // Prints false, OK double sum = 0, d = 0.1;for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) sum += d;System.out.println(sum == 0.5); // Prints true, WHY?",Why does adding 0.1 multiple times remain lossless?

Swing application initialization approach," I have made quite a lot of various Swing apps and their loading time usually vary between just a few seconds and minutes depending on application UI/data size. Also in some cases application data loading is mixed with UI loading.A few seconds load time is not an issue, but when it is longer than let's say 10 seconds - it is obvious that some kind of loading screen should be displayed until UI/data is fully initialized. What you would usually do - create some kind of loading screen first (for example window with logo and some label that is being updated while application is loading) and update it from various loading ""points"" in your application.The problem is - application is usually loaded within single call queued into EDT and it is hard to separate it into multiply calls to EDT without complicating the application's code. So since application loading is performed in a single call queued to EDT you simply cannot update the loading screen properly - update won't be displayed until the application is initialized since the EDT is busy with loading the application.So to implement loading screen in some cases I have moved application UI initialization outside of the EDT and have designed them in the way that it won't do any UI update stuff while loading is performed. Application's frame display and all application UI actions would still be performed in EDT. This is not too good generally, but after lots of testing and looking through the Swing code I know for sure that it doesn't cause any issues even on large applications. Still, that isn't a good to do generally even if it doesn't cause any issues.So the question is: What approaches can be used to display and update application loading screen properly while keeping application initialization in EDT?Hopefully it isn't too broad.Here is a ""dummy"" application that showcases a ""bad"" approach: Also some time ago I found this interesting stuff implemented in JDK7:http://sellmic.com/blog/2012/02/29/hidden-java-7-features-secondaryloop/That SecondaryLoop feature allows to block futher code execution in EDT thread without causing the UI to stuck. It is basically the same what modal JDialog does when opened within EDT. So with this feature I found probably a better way to solve the case: As you can see - in dummyProgressUpdate method I've done some tricky workaround for my case - basically I am blocking execution that performed in EDT and waiting for a separate call queued into EDT that would update loading screen. And that actually works - though I am not sure that this is a good thing to do and whether it might cause any side-effects on a larger scale. And also the loading screen in that case will only be updated when that force update is made which means that if the loading screen has (for example) some animation running - it won't display properly and will only be updated together with text. <code>  import javax.swing.*;import java.awt.*;public class DummyApplication extends JFrame{ private static JDialog loadingDialog; private static JLabel loadingProgress; public DummyApplication () { super ( ""Dummy application"" ); dummyProgressUpdate ( ""Loading content..."", 3000 ); final JLabel label = new JLabel ( ""Custom content"" ); label.setBorder ( BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder ( 100, 100, 100, 100 ) ); getContentPane ().add ( label ); dummyProgressUpdate ( ""Loading settings..."", 3000 ); setDefaultCloseOperation ( WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE ); pack (); setLocationRelativeTo ( null ); dummyProgressUpdate ( ""Opening application..."", 1000 ); } private static void dummyProgressUpdate ( final String status, final int time ) { SwingUtilities.invokeLater ( () -> loadingProgress.setText ( status ) ); dummyLoadTime ( time ); } private static void dummyLoadTime ( final long time ) { try { Thread.sleep ( time ); } catch ( final InterruptedException e ) { e.printStackTrace (); } } public static void main ( final String[] args ) throws Exception { // Displaying loading screen from EDT first SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait ( () -> { loadingDialog = new JDialog ( ( Window ) null, ""Loading screen"" ); loadingProgress = new JLabel ( ""Initializing application..."", JLabel.CENTER ); loadingProgress.setBorder ( BorderFactory.createLineBorder ( Color.LIGHT_GRAY ) ); loadingDialog.getContentPane ().setLayout ( new BorderLayout () ); loadingDialog.getContentPane ().add ( loadingProgress ); loadingDialog.setUndecorated ( true ); loadingDialog.setAlwaysOnTop ( true ); loadingDialog.setModal ( false ); loadingDialog.setSize ( 400, 100 ); loadingDialog.setLocationRelativeTo ( null ); loadingDialog.setVisible ( true ); } ); // Initializing application outside of the EDT final DummyApplication applicationFrame = new DummyApplication (); // Displaying application from the EDT SwingUtilities.invokeLater ( () -> { loadingDialog.setVisible ( false ); applicationFrame.setVisible ( true ); } ); }} import javax.swing.*;import java.awt.*;public class DummyApplication extends JFrame{ private static JDialog loadingDialog; private static JLabel loadingProgress; public DummyApplication () { super ( ""Dummy application"" ); dummyProgressUpdate ( ""Loading content..."", 3000 ); final JLabel label = new JLabel ( ""Custom content"" ); label.setBorder ( BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder ( 100, 100, 100, 100 ) ); getContentPane ().add ( label ); dummyProgressUpdate ( ""Loading settings..."", 3000 ); setDefaultCloseOperation ( WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE ); pack (); setLocationRelativeTo ( null ); dummyProgressUpdate ( ""Displaying application..."", 1000 ); } private static void dummyProgressUpdate ( final String status, final int time ) { // Use SecondaryLoop to block execution and force loading screen update final SecondaryLoop loop = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit ().getSystemEventQueue ().createSecondaryLoop (); SwingUtilities.invokeLater ( () -> { loadingProgress.setText ( status ); loop.exit (); } ); loop.enter (); // Perform dummy heavy operation dummyLoadTime ( time ); } private static void dummyLoadTime ( final long time ) { try { Thread.sleep ( time ); } catch ( final InterruptedException e ) { e.printStackTrace (); } } public static void main ( final String[] args ) throws Exception { // Displaying loading screen from EDT first SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait ( () -> { loadingDialog = new JDialog ( ( Window ) null, ""Loading screen"" ); loadingProgress = new JLabel ( ""Initializing application..."", JLabel.CENTER ); loadingProgress.setBorder ( BorderFactory.createLineBorder ( Color.LIGHT_GRAY ) ); loadingDialog.getContentPane ().setLayout ( new BorderLayout () ); loadingDialog.getContentPane ().add ( loadingProgress ); loadingDialog.setUndecorated ( true ); loadingDialog.setAlwaysOnTop ( true ); loadingDialog.setModal ( false ); loadingDialog.setSize ( 400, 100 ); loadingDialog.setLocationRelativeTo ( null ); loadingDialog.setVisible ( true ); } ); // Initializing and displaying application from the EDT SwingUtilities.invokeLater ( () -> { final DummyApplication applicationFrame = new DummyApplication (); loadingDialog.setVisible ( false ); applicationFrame.setVisible ( true ); } ); }}",Swing application initialization and loading screen approach

In your situation, it's probably a combination of these.That would mean that we can never prevent them, but only to deal with them. Is that true?

get EntityManager in JpaRepository java 8 default method," When using the new Spring Data Evans release it's nice to be able to use some of the nice stuff that came with java 8. One of them is default implementations in interfaces. The repository below uses QueryDSL to make queries type safe.My problem is that before when I wrote this I used the pattern of a separate UserRepositoryCustom interface for the findByLogin and then another class UserRepositoryImpl and in that class I would have the @PersistenceContext to get the current EntityManager.How do I get the EntityManager when I don't have a class? Is it even possible? <code>  @Repositorypublic interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, UUID> { final QUser qUser = QUser.user; // How do I get the entityManager since this is a interface, i cannot have any variables? //@PersistenceContext //EntityManager entityManager; public default Optional<User> findByLogin(String login) { JPAQuery query = new JPAQuery(entityManager); User user = query .from(qUser) .where( qUser.deleter.isNull(), qUser.locked.isFalse(), qUser.login.equalsIgnoreCase(login) ) .singleResult(qUser); return Optional.ofNullable(user); }}",Should I use Java 8 default methods for manually implemented Spring Data repository methods?

How to handle localized decimal separator with Jackson," The input stream I am parsing with Jackson contains latitude and longitude values such as here: For some reason the server uses commas as the decimal separator which produces an InvalidFormatException. Since I cannot change the server output format I would like to teach Jackson's ObjectMapper to handle those cases. Here is the relevant code: And here is the POJO: How can I tell Jackson that those coordinate values come with a German locale?I suppose a custom deserializer for the specific fields as discussed here would be the way to go.

How-to make Hibernate Validator respect annotation order and stop validation on the first field violation?," I have a bean where I define multiple validation annotations for each field e.g. I have encountered two one problem that I cannot resolve in any easy way. Validation order of the specified annotations for each field is random i.e. do not happen in the order the annotations are defined. I believe @GroupSequence will not help since it only defines group validation sequence, not annotation sequence.As @Tom correctly commented, violations are reported as Set which means there is no 1:1 mapping between execution order of annotations and reported violations.I want to invalidate only one rule for each field i.e. if it does not match pattern do not try to check if the value is >= 1. Currently if is set myField to ""abc"" it will report both @Pattern and @Min violations. Setting failFast property of a validator to true does not help because I'm using the same validator instance to validate all the fields in my bean, and it will stop validating other fields as soon as the first violation for the whole bean is encountered.Edit. I tried to implement custom composite constraint with @ReportAsSingleViolation. The problem is that it will report the same message for all violations involved in composition. This is not what I need.Suggestions, please? <code>  @NotEmpty@Pattern(regexp=""(\\-?\\d)+"")@Min(value=1)String myField;",How-to make Hibernate Validator stop validation on the first field violation?

try{}finally{} construct with return values," I was wondering why the following code would be accepted by the Java compiler: This can and should not work. The java specification states the finally block will always be executed, but at the same time the return value has already been specified. So either you cannot execute the return ""b"" statement, because you have exited at return ""a"", which would be incorrect.However, the other option is that you execute the return ""b"" statement, and thereby totally disregarding the return ""a"" statement...I would say that both are wrong, and I would expect that this does not compile. However it compiles and runs fine. I will leave the answer as a nice exercise to the reader ;). Basically my question is: Besides being bad practice, would this be considered a Java bug, or does this have other wonderful uses other than obfuscation?Edit:The question is not so much if it is a bug, that has been answered, but does it have nice use cases? <code>  public class Main { public static void main(String ... args){ System.out.println(""a() = "" + a()); } public static String a (){ try { return ""a""; }catch(Throwable t){ }finally{ return ""b""; } }}",try{} finally{} construct with return values

Difference in LinkedList toArray(T[] a) and toArray() methods," I've been learning how to program with java and I haven't got any clear explanation about the difference of LinkedList's toArray(T[] a) and toArray() method. The second one simply returns all of the elements within the LinkedList object as an array, right? But, what about the first one?EDIT :I mean, I read the documentation from oracle, it says : Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If the list fits in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this list. If the list fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than the list), the element in the array immediately following the end of the list is set to null. (This is useful in determining the length of the list only if the caller knows that the list does not contain any null elements.) Like the toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs.

CAS Single logout nor working," I am implementing Single-Sign-On + Single-Log-Out in a Java EE environment through CAS.On the authentication side I have the cas-server-webapp v4.0.1. Then 2 simple Java + Spring MVC web apps with the cas-client-corev3.1.10.No issues regarding single sign on. If I access /app1 I'm redirected to cas login page in cas-server-webapp. After the user+pass input I get redirected to /app1 correctly authenticated. In addition, if I navigate to /app2, this one gets its auth ticket. So far so good.As for single logout, maybe I have misunderstood the doc: but this is what I do:app1 and app2 have each a Spring controller mapped for /logout url: That is to say, I invalidate the http session and redirect to the cas server logout url so that the tickets get invalidated.In the cas server log I see that it destroys the TGT ticket and sends a logout request to the CAS filter of each app: Now, suppose that I logged out from /cas1, I am sent back to the cas-server login page. Without login again, if I access /app2, I am allowed to navigated this app as if I were still authenticated and I can access both its java.user.Principal and session. How can this be possible? Shouldn't the logout request received in /app2 have destroyed the Principal and http session? <code>  @Controllerpublic class LogoutController { @RequestMapping(""/logout"") public String logout(HttpSession session){ session.invalidate(); return ""redirect:https://cas-server-host:8443/cas/logout?service=http://cas-server-host:9080/cas1/action/index""; }} DEBUG [org.jasig.cas.CentralAuthenticationServiceImpl] - <Removing ticket [TGT-9-inxrphuRfIFpkbPTvNf6v1bAx7RlR7IMeMUFU0aokNCdbZ43Ij-cas01.example.org] from registry.>DEBUG [org.jasig.cas.ticket.registry.DefaultTicketRegistry] - <Attempting to retrieve ticket [TGT-9-inxrphuRfIFpkbPTvNf6v1bAx7RlR7IMeMUFU0aokNCdbZ43Ij-cas01.example.org]>DEBUG [org.jasig.cas.ticket.registry.DefaultTicketRegistry] - <Ticket [TGT-9-inxrphuRfIFpkbPTvNf6v1bAx7RlR7IMeMUFU0aokNCdbZ43Ij-cas01.example.org] found in registry.>DEBUG [org.jasig.cas.CentralAuthenticationServiceImpl] - <Ticket found.

How to make my class to be not getting reflected?," In Java docs it mentioned that using f.setAccessible(true) method we can violate the principal of encapsulation.But if I am writing any class which has full security, for instance with a private variable, how can I prevent it from being accessed with reflection?For example I have a class with full secured instance variable: But I can modify that instance variable using reflection like this: In my code, how can I prevent an immutable class being changed with reflection? <code>  public final class Immutable { private final int someVal; public Immutable(int someVal) { this.someVal = someVal; } public int getVal() { return someVal; }} public class Tester { public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchFieldException, SecurityException, IllegalArgumentException, IllegalAccessException { Immutable i = new Immutable(10); // output 10 System.out.println(i.getVal()); Field f = i.getClass().getDeclaredField(""someVal""); f.setAccessible(true); f.set(i, 11); // output is 11 which implies some value modified System.out.println(i.getVal()); }}",How to prevent access via reflection?
Sending boolean as requst parameter," In my web application I have a link - ""Create New User"".

Using Gradle with native dependencies downloaded on-demand," I am trying to use Sigar in a Gradle project. Sigar distribution is by default provided with 2 types of files:a JAR that contains classessome native files (.so, dylib, .dll)My purpose is to repackage these files so that I can use them as dependencies deployed and downloaded on-demand from a personal Maven repository.My first try was to define dependencies as files in order to check that my application is working as expected before to repackage. Below is the Gradle code I used for my first test that works: Then, I have repackaged Sigar native files into a JAR and renamed the other one to match rules for maven artifacts since I want to deploy them in a Maven repository. Below is what I get:sigar-1.6.4.jar (contains .class files)sigar-1.6.4-native.jar (contains .dylib, .so, and .dll files at the root)The next step was to deploy these files in my custom repository. Then, I have updated my build.gradle as follows: Unfortunately, when I do a gradle clean build, new dependencies are fetched but native libraries can no longer be found at runtime since now I get the following exception: Consequently, I am looking for a solution to fetch and to link native files to my Java app like for other dependencies. Any advice, comment, suggestion, help, solution, etc. are welcome ;)  <code>  dependencies { compile files(""${rootDir}/lib/sigar/sigar.jar"") runtime fileTree(dir: ""${rootDir}/lib/sigar/"", exclude: ""*.jar"")} dependencies { compile 'sigar:sigar:1.6.4' runtime 'sigar:sigar:1.6.4:native'} Error thrown in postRegister method: rethrowing <java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: org.hyperic.sigar.Sigar.getCpuInfoList()[Lorg/hyperic/sigar/CpuInfo;>",Using Gradle with native dependencies
"Why sometimes, ""=="" relational operation cannot be used in place of .equals() method for comparing objects?"," I looked it up in a book, which is usually more thorough in terms of explanations than a website.Take this for ex.: The condition will be true only if nickname is referring to the same String object.Here is a sentence I found confusing, can anyone please explain to why this is the case: For efficiency, Java makes only one string object for every string constant. The book points out that the way of assembling the object ""Bob"" also affects whether the condition will be true of not, which confuses me the most.For ex.: But if ""Bob"" is created from .substring() method, condition will be FALSE. Why is this so?Edit: in the end of the book's explanation, I found a sentence which also confuses me a lot: Because string objects are always constructed by the compiler, you never have an interest in whether two strings objects are shared.Doesn't everything we write get constructed by the compiler? <code>  if (nickname == ""Bob"") String nickname = ""Bob"";...if (nickname == ""Bob"") //TRUE String name = ""Robert"";String nickname = name.substring(0,3);...if (nickname == ""Rob"")//FALSE","Why sometimes, ""=="" relational operator cannot be used in place of .equals() method for comparing objects?"
Implementing Bressenham's circle drawing algorithm," I have written an implementation of Bresenham's circle drawing algorithm. This algorithms takes advantage of the highly symmetrical properties of a circle (it only computes points from the 1st octant and draws the other points by taking advantage of symmetry). Therefore I was expecting it to be very fast. The Graphics programming black book, chapter #35 was titled ""Bresenham is fast, and fast is good"", and though it was about the line drawing algorithm, I could reasonably expect the circle drawing algorithm to also be fast (since the principle is the same).Here is my java, swing implementation This method uses the following drawPointmethod: The two methods getNativeX and getNativeY are used to switch coordinates from originating in the upper left corner of the screen to a system that has it origin in the center of the panel with a more classic axis orientation. I have also created an implementation of a circle drawing algorithm based on trigonometrical formulaes (x=R*Math.cos(angle)and y= R*Math.sin(angle)) and a third implementation using a call to the standard drawArc method (available on the Graphics object). These additional implementations are for the sole purpose of comparing Bresenham's algorithm to them.I then created methods to draw a bunch of circles in order to be able to get good measures of the spent time. Here is the method I use to draw a bunch of circles using Bresenham's algorithm Finally I override the paint method of the JPanel I am using, to draw the bunch of circles and to measure the time it took each type to draw. Here is the paint method: Here is the kind of rendering it would generate (drawing 1000 circles of each type)Unfortunately my Bresenham's implementation is very slow. I took many comparatives measures, and the Bresenham's implementation is not only slower than the Graphics.drawArcbut also slower than the trigonometrical approach. Take a look at the following measures for a various number of circles drawn.What part of my implementation is more time-consuming? Is there any workaround I could use to improve it?

Looking for code examples for Google Apps Admin Java API," I have written a Java app that synchronises Google Groups on our Google Apps for Education domain (similar in function to Google Apps School Directory Sync, but customised for some of our specific needs).The synchronisation works, but it is slow because it is performing each task individually. I know that there are API interfaces for batching operations, but I can't find any examples of how this is implemented with the Java API.The code I'm using looks similar to this (authentication and other setup is taken care of elsewhere): Instead of executing these operations one-by-one, I would like to batch them instead. Can anyone tell me how? <code>  try{ Member m = new Member (); m.setEmail (member); m.setRole (""MEMBER""); service.members ().insert (group, m).execute ();}catch (Exception e){ // ERROR handling}",Batching operations in Google Apps Admin Java API
In spring-amqp how to set the consumer-tag value," I am trying to update the consumer-tag to be more informative than the randomly generated string. We have a pattern which we use that includes hostname + identifier + randomized string. This works fine in our other services (ie: NodeJS with ampqlib) because they provide a mechanism to pass in this value. However, for our Java services, we use spring-amqp and it looks like there is no way to pass in a consumer-tag value. I took a look at BlockingQueueConsumer and it is currently hard-coded to an empty string: Is there any way to get it not to be an empty string (which will result in a randomly generated one) besides creating our own type of consumer?Thanks! <code>  String consumerTag = this.channel.basicConsume(queue, this.acknowledgeMode.isAutoAck(), """", false, this.exclusive, this.consumerArgs, this.consumer);",How to set the consumer-tag value in spring-amqp
How does a DLL search for its dependent DLL?," Say I have JNI.dll. It depends on native.dll. Now my Java application calls System.loadLibrary(""JNI""). Will the following folder layout work? My guess is, there are 2 levels of dependency resolution. [Level 1]:System.loadLibrary(""JNI"") uses JVM property java.library.path to locate JNI.dll.[Level 2]:JNI.dll relies on Windows system mechanism to locate native.dll.Is this correct? If I set %_JAVA_OPTIONS% as -Djava.library.path=MainFolder\SubFolder, I think it can cover the search for JNI.dll. But will it cover the search for native.dll, too?ADD 1It seems my guess of 2 levels got confirmed from here: How to add native library to ""java.library.path"" with Eclipse launch (instead of overriding it)See comment by kevin cline. But the mentioned solution with LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable only applies to Linux.ADD 2I think I didn't make my question clear. Let me put it this way.My confusion is: the JNI.dll depends on native.dll. Both of them are not in the main.exe's current working directory. Actually they are in a sub folder of CWD.If I run main.exe directly, I just need to set the java.library.path = <other path>\MainFolder\SubFolder. Both DLL are found correctly.But if I run my project from Eclipse, besides setting the java.library.path, I have to put the ""\MainFolder\SubFolder"" in the %PATH% environment variable.I just don't know why Eclipse is so different. <code>  MainFolder |--main.exe |--SubFolder |--JNI.dll |--native.dll",How does a JNI DLL search for its dependent native DLL?

Best way to implement View.OnClickListener in android," Suppose we have an Activity with a lot of views on which OnClickListener is to be registered.The most common way to implement this is to let the Activity-Subclass implement the OnClickListener, something like this: The way I like to implement it is to create a private class inside the Activity-Subclass and let that inner class implement the OnClickListener: This way the code seems more organized and easy to maintain.Moreover, talking about ""Is-a"", ""Has-a"" relationships, the latter seems to be a good practice because now the Activity-Subclass would have a ""Has-a"" relationship with the ClickListener.While in the former method we would be saying that Our Activity-Subclass ""Is-a"" ClickListener, which ain't completely true.Note that, I am not concerned with the memory overhead the latter would cause.Also, adding onClick tag in xml is completely out of question.So, what really is the best way to implement a ClickListener?Please don't suggest any libraries like RoboGuice or ButterKnife etc.UPDATE:I would like to share the approach I finally adopted.I directly implement the listener in Activity/Fragment.As far as OOP design is concerned. The ""HAS-A"" approach doesn't offers any practical benefits and even takes up more memory. Considering the amount of nested classes (and the memory overhead) we will be creating for every similar listener we implement, this approach should clearly be avoided. <code>  public class ActivityMain extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener{ @Override public void onClick(View view) { switch (view.getId()) { //handle multiple view click events } }} public class ActivityMain extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener{ private class ClickListener implements View.OnClickListener { @Override public void onClick(View view) { switch (view.getId()) { //handle multiple view click events } } }}",Best way to implement View.OnClickListener in Android

Get SSLContext for default system keystore in Java(JSEE)," I've been using custom keystore in my program by specifying javax.net.ssl.keyStore, javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword, javax.net.ssl.trustStore, javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword. My truststore contains self-signed certificates. Now I want to make some https request(say to https://google.com) and use default jre system trusstore that contains information about different CAs. To make http requests I use OkHttp library. Its client has an option to specify SslSocketFactory, but to get it I need to initialise SSLContext for default jre truststore. How can I do that?UPDATE:The code I went with is <code>  KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS""); // load default jvm keystore keyStore.load(new FileInputStream( System.getProperties() .getProperty(""java.home"") + File.separator + ""lib"" + File.separator + ""security"" + File.separator + ""cacerts""), ""changeit"".toCharArray()); TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance( TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm()); tmf.init(keyStore); SSLContext ctx = SSLContext.getInstance(""TLS""); ctx.init(null, tmf.getTrustManagers(), new SecureRandom());",Get SSLContext for default system truststore in Java(JSEE)

Why use reflection when MethodHandles are an option?," With the release of Java 7 came the MethodHandle, which allows a user to invoke a method as if using its underlying bytecode. In particular, the MethodHandles.Lookup class provides factory methods to create method handles to access class members: The factory methods on a Lookup object correspond to all major use cases for methods, constructors, and fields. Each method handle created by a factory method is the functional equivalent of a particular bytecode behavior.Functionally, this is more or less equivalent to using reflection to access these same class members, yet method handles are faster than reflection.So, is there any reason to still use reflection functionalities like Field#get(..)/Method.invoke(..) or are these methods effectively obsolete with the introduction of the faster method handles?Note that while method handles were introduced in Java 7, my question primarily pertains to Java 8, in which they were optimized to supposedly reach performance approximately equal to direct field/method calls, surpassing reflection's ability. <code> ",Why use reflection to access class members when MethodHandle is faster?

SQL execution time much slower with OJDBC than with SQL client," For inexplicable reasons however, this morning the performance increased for two of my Queries that used to be slow. I have no idea why. I have no authority over the server, maybe someone changed something. The problem is no more.In a nutshell:s.executeQuery(sql) runs extremely slowly within a tomcat servlet on serverSame query runs fine without servlet (simple java program) on the same machineNot all queries are slow within the servlet. Only a few bigger ones doSame servlet runs fast on another machineUPDATESPlease read the updates below the text !I have a servlet that executes SQL requests and sends back the results via JSON. For some reason, some requests take a huge amount of time to execute, but when I run them in any Oracle SQL Client, they are executed in no time.I am talking about a difference of 1 second vs 5 minutes for the same SQL (that is not that complex).How can this be explained ?Is there a way to improve the performance of a java based SQL request ?I am using the traditional way of executing queries: I tried with ojdbc14 and ojdbc6 but there was no difference.UPDATE 1:I tried the same SQL in a local Java project (not a servlet) on my client machine, and I get the results immediately. So I assume the problem is coming from my servlet or the tomcat configuration ?UPDATE 2:The culprit is indeed rs = s.executeQuery(mySql); I tried to use preparedStatement instead, but there is no difference.UPDATE 3:I created a new Servlet running on a local Tomcat and the Query comes back fast. The problem is therefore coming from my production server or Tomcat config. Any ideas what config items could affect this ?UPDATE 4:I tried the same code in a normal java program instead of a servlet (still on the same server) and the results are coming fast. Ergo the problem comes from the Servlet itself (or Tomcat ?).

Why this variable initialization compiles," How does this compiles without error? As my understanding, the compiler checks the type of the variable (in this case String), then sees if the type of the expression on the right side corresponds to the variable's type (or at least a subtype but let's stick to the simple case with the String class since it's final). My question is how does str = ""hello"" compile?

Issue with android snackbar action," I am using Snackbar in android and I have implemented an action so that user can undo the action (the action is clearing all the items in the listview).Removing and adding the items back to the listview has already been done and working fine.My issue is that, items are stored in sqlite database and how can I delete the items from tables?

Guice: Making non-assisted dependencies assisted," Suppose I have a third party class as follows: Now suppose that I have a factory interface like so: The idea is that I wish to have a MyObjectFactory that builds a MyObject for a fixed Foo - that is, essentially adding in the @Assisted annotation on the Bar constructor parameter from the outside. Of course, manually implementing MyObjectFactory is always possible: But let's say that there are conditions that require me to have Guice build MyObject instances - for example, method interceptors. This seems like a job for ""injecting the injector"": This sounds evil and boiler-plate-y, so I'm wondering if there are any alternate implementations and/or a way to have Guice generate the factory impl. <code>  public class MyObject { @Inject public MyObject(Foo foo, Bar bar) { ... }} public interface MyObjectFactory { public MyObject build(Bar bar);} public class MyObjectFactoryImpl implements MyObjectFactory { @Inject private Provider<Foo> foo; @Override public MyObject build(Bar bar) { return new MyObject(foo.get(), bar); }} public class MyObjectFactoryImpl implements MyObjectFactory { @Inject private Injector injector; @Override public MyObject build(Bar bar) { Injector child = injector.createChildInjector(new AbstractModule() { @Override protected void configure() { bind(Bar.class).toInstance(bar); // Set up method interceptors for MyObject here... } }); return child.getInstance(MyObject.class); }}",How can I make a non-assisted dependency assisted?
Method call to Future.get blocks. Is that really desirable?," Please read the question carefully before marking this as duplicate. Below is the snippet of the pseudo code. My question is- Does the below code not defeat the very notion of parallel asynchronous processing? The reason I ask this is because in the below code the main thread would submit a task to be executed in a different thread. After submitting the task in the queue, it blocks on Future.get() method for the task to return the value. I would rather have the task executed in the main thread rather than submitting to a different thread and waiting for the results. What is that I gained by executing the task in a new thread? I am aware that you could wait for a limited time etc, but then what if I really care about the result? The problem gets worse if there are multiple tasks to be executed. It seems to me that we are just doing the work synchronously. I am aware of the Guava library which provides a non blocking listener interface. But I am interested to know if my understanding is correct for the Future.get() API. If it is correct, why is the Future.get() designed to block thereby defeating the whole process of parallel processing?Note - For the record, I use JAVA 6 <code>  public static void main(String[] args){private ExectorService executorService = ...Future future = executorService.submit(new Callable(){ public Object call() throws Exception { System.out.println(""Asynchronous Callable""); return ""Callable Result""; }});System.out.println(""future.get() = "" + future.get());}",Method call to Future.get() blocks. Is that really desirable?
When creating two new identical objects do they refer to the same location in memory?, I am starting to learn some Java and I have been reading a lot about how memory is allocated by the JVM and consequently how this memory is freed using the garbage collector.

Similar to how the String Pool works.  <code> ,Do two objects of a class refer to the same memory location?

I tried to migrate the Dagger 1 implementation to Dagger 2 by following the Dagger 2 documentation, but it did not work.For some unexplained reason the @Component class with the Dagger prefix is not generated.Because of this I decided to try the Dagger 2 Coffee sample.I created a new Eclipse Java project, converted it to Maven, added the sample code and the Dagger 2 dependencies to the pom file: My build failed with the following error: I extracted the Coffee component interface to a separate file (named Coffee.java) and tried again but I got the same error. I removed the Factory Path jars from Dagger 1, but the result was still the same. If I try to add the Dagger 2 jars, I get the Multiple problems have occurred window with the following error text Errors occurred during the build.Errors running builder 'Java Builder' on project 'dagger'.com/google/common/collect/SetMultimapI found out that the problem occurs when I add the dagger-compiler jar.If I remove every jar from the Factory Path the build still fails. I tried to find the DaggerCoffee file, that should be automatically generated but I couldn't find it.How can I use Dagger 2 with Eclipse? I red the documentation several times and spend a day researching this, but no luck so far. <code>  <dependency> <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId> <artifactId>dagger</artifactId> <version>2.0.1</version> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId> <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId> <version>2.0.1</version> <optional>true</optional> </dependency> Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: DaggerCoffeeApp_Coffee cannot be resolved",Dagger 2 not generateing components on Eclipse
Why does it give this date?," I have a java code, that inputs date in a specific format. Now I'm entering 2015-13-11 89:90:90 which is an invalid date. But it returns Thu Jan 14 18:31:30 IST 2016 as the date. Why is this so? How do I make it to return null as the date? <code>  static Date parseDate(String userInput){ DateFormat format = new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss""); Date date = null; try { date = format.parse(userInput); System.out.println(date); }catch(ParseException pe){ date=null; System.out.println(""Not a valid date""); } return date; }",Why does SimpleDateFormat.parse accept an invalid date string?
How does dead code elemination of Math.log() works in JMH sample," Everyone who tries to utilize JMH framework to create some meaningful tests will come across JMH sample tests(http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/).As we went through them we stucked by the dead code elemination (JMHSample_08_DeadCode.java).Excerpt: The measurement of measureWrong() will be approximately the same as for the baseline test. Because the return value of the Math.log() is never used. Therefore the HotSpot compiler will eliminate the dead code. Ok, understood but how can the compiler decide that Math.log() can be eliminated.As we looked closely to the test we note that Math.log() is a native method. And native calls go down to the OS and execute a corresponding lib. Right? This lead us to the assumption that native calls could be eliminated by the compiler if their return value is not used and they don't perform io operations.We wonder what if the lib which resides somewhere in the OS and which handles the native calls from the java worldprovides no return value but does io operations (e.g. logging).Will those instructions completely be wiped out? To proof our assumption we reconstructed the scenario with a simple JMH test and a native call.We compiled three c-native libs to perform:returning 42parameter additionempty file creationAs we called them in a JMH test (similarly to measureWrong() test) none of them has been eliminated, not even the one which doesn't perform an io operation.Due to the test result our assumption cannot be confirmed. Native calls cannot be optimized out, meaning that Math.log() and custom native calls do not have the same basis. They are not equaly native. Maybe we made a mistake in our native lib code and at least the native call of test 1 should have been eleminated. If this is true we will share our code with you.So we searched further and found a term Intrinsics where java code will be replaced with acorresponding to the architecture very optimized code. java.lang.Math.log() is having such intrinsic implementation. Are there any relations between the Natives and Intrinsics?If the above assumption of the relationship between Natives and Intrinsics is valid will the compiler perform the following steps to eliminate the native call?At the compile time the HotSpot checks the existence of the intrinsic implementation (in jdk?) for the Math.log() and replaces Math.log() with that code.Afterwards the second check happens where HotSpot looks after the return value of a method. And on this outcome the HotSpot decides to eliminate the Math.log() call completely. <code>  private double x = Math.PI;@Benchmarkpublic void baseline() { // do nothing, this is a baseline}@Benchmarkpublic void measureWrong() { // This is wrong: result is not used, and the entire computation is optimized out.

How to cope with mixed integer/real numbers constraint solving?," I'm working on source-to-source transformer for Java 6*1). I need to maintain negative information as well as positive information, so I have to implement the small constraint system for the transformer. The constraint system is the restricted kind of CNF formula that can be defined as the following:(v1 == c1 /\ v2 == c2 ... vn == cn) /\ ((w1,1 != d1,1 \/ w1,2 !== d1,2 ... w1,k != d1,k) /\ (w2,1 != d2,1 \/ ...) /\ ... (wm,1 != dm,1 \/ ... \/ wm,k != dm,k))where vi == ci are equality constraints (substitutions, variable assignments), wj != dj,l are disequality constraints, vi, wj,l are variables, ci, dj,l are constants (literals).Constant types are Java primitive types and reference types mapped to integers. Constants are also arbitrary AST-like structures (which represent partially evaluated expressions and possibly contain (meta)-variables).Constraint system works as the following:When the transformer reaches a conditional (e.g. if(x == c) then b else b1) the constraint x == c is added to the constraint system of then branch and the constraint x != c, in turn, is added to the constraint system (formula) of else branch.So, new formula of then branch is: x == c /\ formula (positive part of the formula is the conjunction of equalities);new formula of else branch is: x != c \/ formula (negative part of the formula is the conjunction of disjunctions of disequalities).Edit: Satisfiability of the constraint system.For the constraint system to be satisfiable it must be possible to assign values to the variables in the system such that constraints are satisfied.The constraint system is thus satisfied iff there exists a substituition Theta such that, for each equation v = c Thetav will be syntactically identical to Thetac, and likewise, for each disequation w != d Thetaw will be syntactically different from Thetad. Unfortunately, I'm pretty new to constraint programming and I came across the problems.It is not entirely clear for me how to map AST constants to integers in this case.Should I simply use the index of the constants' array or some hash function?It is not clear how to handle long type. Rewrite int-based solver making it long-based or use floating-point solver?It is also not clear how to handle combined integer and floating-point data.As I realize the straightforward solution is using floating point solver for both integer and floating point constraints. Is it true? Or I can solve floating-point and integer part of constraints separately?Please, could someone help me? Some directions, hints ...1) Currently, source=8 / target=8 scheme is accepted. <code> ",How to perform constraint solving with mixed data types?
How to use Java8 method reference in scala?," I'm developing a JavaFX8 application in Scala but I couldn't figure out how to pass a method reference to an event handler.

"JavaFX webstart (JNLP), Add all-permissions to manifest with Maven"," I recently started experimenting with Maven. As a test, I'm trying to create a simple JavaFX8 webstart application. For this I used the JavaFX sample under the Maven category in Netbeans 8. This gives me a simple HelloWorld application:I have added a new profile to my pom.xml file called 'jnlp'. This to be able to create a JNLP file (using the webstart maven plugin) when building the project. When I build this, it generates a launch.jnlp file and a mavenprojectHelloWorld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file in the /target/jnlp directory. I double checked with jarsigner to check if my jar file was correctly signed. This was the output:I copied the launch.jnlp and mavenprojectHelloWorld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file to my webhost (http://(my_url)/maven) and started the HelloWorld app by launching the JNLP file. However, when I do that, I get a message 'Java Application Blocked' window and an 'Application Error' afterwards:The Java console told me the following: After checking the manifest file from my JAR file, I noticed that the permissions and codebase tags were missing. Now I want to add those through maven. After some reading and searching, I found a similar question here: Simpliest way to add an attribute to a jar Manifest in Maven. So I tried to add the following to my pom.xml: After building again, I checked the manifest file to view my changes, but it seems that manifest file was not changed. I still receive the following: I must be doing something wrong or missing something. When reading up on creating JNLP files with Maven and how to edit the manifest file, I noticed a lot of old information on the web that wasn't valid anymore. So it kinda got me confused about what to do know. I hope someone can point me in the right direction.Update 31/08/2015:Forgot to mention I'm using a velocity template, you can find the template below: Another thing I noticed is that, building with the JNLP profile works fine. But running the project with the JNLP profile (in NetBeans) seems to fail (running with default profile works thou). I don't know if this has anything to do with this issue or not (as I'm not familiar with Maven yet). However, this is the output in NetBeans when trying to run the project: <code>  ....<profiles> <profile> <id>jnlp</id> <build> <plugins> <plugin> <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId> <artifactId>webstart-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>1.0-beta-6</version> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId> <artifactId>webstart-pack200-impl</artifactId> <version>1.0-beta-6</version> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId> <artifactId>keytool-api-1.7</artifactId> <version>1.5</version> </dependency> </dependencies> <executions> <execution> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>jnlp</goal> </goals> </execution> </executions> <configuration> <codebase>http://(my_url)/maven/</codebase> //replaced the url obviously :) <jnlp> <mainClass>com.mycompany.mavenprojecthelloworld.MainApp</mainClass> </jnlp> <pack200> <enabled>false</enabled> </pack200> <sign> <keystore>${project.basedir}/src/main/jnlp/mykeystore</keystore> <keypass>mykeypass</keypass> <storepass>mystorepass</storepass> <alias>myalias</alias> <verify>true</verify> </sign> <verbose>true</verbose> </configuration> </plugin> </plugins> </build> </profile></profiles> java.lang.SecurityException: JAR manifest requested to run in sandbox only: http://(my_url)/maven/mavenprojectHelloWorld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jarat com.sun.deploy.security.DeployManifestChecker.verify(Unknown Source)at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployManifestChecker.verify(Unknown Source)at com.sun.javaws.security.AppPolicy.grantUnrestrictedAccess(Unknown Source)at com.sun.javaws.security.JNLPSignedResourcesHelper.checkSignedResourcesHelper(Unknown Source)at com.sun.javaws.security.JNLPSignedResourcesHelper.checkSignedResources(Unknown Source)at sun.plugin2.applet.JNLP2Manager.prepareLaunchFile(Unknown Source)at sun.plugin2.applet.JNLP2Manager.loadJarFiles(Unknown Source)at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2Manager$AppletExecutionRunnable.run(Unknown Source)at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) <project>...<build> ... <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId> <version>2.6</version> <configuration> <archive> <manifestEntries> <Permissions>all-permissions</Permissions> <Codebase>*</Codebase> </manifestEntries> </archive> </configuration> </plugin>...</build></project> Manifest-Version: 1.0Permissions: sandboxJavaFX-Version: 8.0Created-By: JavaFX PackagerMain-Class: com.mycompany.mavenprojecthelloworld.MainApp <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?><jnlp spec=""1.0+"" codebase=""$jnlpCodebase"" href=""$outputFile""> <information> <title>$project.name</title> <vendor>$project.Organization.Name</vendor> <description>$project.Description</description> </information> <resources> <j2se version=""1.6+"" href=""http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se"" /> $dependencies </resources> <security> <all-permissions/> </security> <applet-desc width=""1024"" height=""768"" main-class=""com.javafx.main.NoJavaFXFallback"" name=""$project.name""> <param name=""requiredFXVersion"" value=""8.0+""/> </applet-desc> <jfx:javafx-desc width=""1024"" height=""768"" main-class=""$mainClass"" name=""$project.name"" /> <update check=""background""/></jnlp> ....--- exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec (default-cli) @ mavenprojectHelloWorld ---Error: Could not find or load main class com.mycompany.mavenprojecthelloworld.MainApp------------------------------------------------------------------------BUILD FAILURE------------------------------------------------------------------------Total time: 1.308sFinished at: Thu Aug 27 12:00:03 CEST 2015Final Memory: 8M/155M------------------------------------------------------------------------Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec (default-cli) on project mavenprojectHelloWorld: Command execution failed.

BufferedWriter buffer size not work," I met a problem with BufferedWriter when I write data to a single file with some threads.I set the buffer size of the BufferedWriter, but no matter what number I set, it flushes the data to disk when the buffer is 8192 (the default buffer size), not the size I set (here is 16384). Is there a problem with my code? This is how I'm constructing the BufferedWriter: This is the full code: <code>  new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(fileName, true), 16384); import java.io.BufferedWriter;import java.io.File;import java.io.FileWriter;import java.io.IOException;public class Test1 { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { for(int i =0;i<10;i++){ MyThread r = new MyThread(); Thread t = new Thread(r); t.start(); } }}class MyThread implements Runnable { public void run() { String s = ""{addffffffkkkljlkj2015dd}\n""; BufferedWriter bw = null; try { bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter( ""/Users/liaoliuqing/Downloads/1.txt"", true),16384); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } for(int i =0 ; i<1000; i++){ try { bw.write(String.format(""%03d"", i)+s); //bw.flush(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }}",How to set the buffer size on a BufferedWriter over a FileWriter

Chaining lambda Functions," When a Java method accepts a Function<? super T, ? extends U>, then it's possible to provide method references in a syntax like the following: MyClass::myMethod.However, I'm wondering if there's a way to chain multiple method calls.Here's an example to illustrate the case. I am wondering if there is a syntax to translate this to a lambda expression. I am hoping there is something like the following: Alternatively, is there a utility class to merge functions? <code>  // on a specific object, without lambdamyString.trim().toUpperCase() // something like: (which doesn't work)String::trim::toUpperCase // example: (which does not exist)FunctionUtil.chain(String::trim, String::toUpperCase);",Chaining lambda functions
Force Commons HTTPClient 3.1 to use TLS 1.2," I wish to force Apache Commons HTTP-Client (version 3.1) to use TLS 1.2 as the only protocol for HTTPS.This is due to the server supposedly being upgraded to TLS 1.2 and not accepting any older protocol anymore (causing 'Connection Reset' to be returned).For further context, probably irrelevant, the HTTP-Client is used along with Axis2 to make a SOAP; some of the code used for setting up the HttpClient is below: Thanks a lot for the help! <code>  MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager connMgr = new MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager();this.httpClient = new HttpClient(connMgr);// initialize HttpClient parametersHttpClientParams hcParams = this.httpClient.getParams();// Maximum time to wait to receive connection from poolhcParams.setConnectionManagerTimeout(this.maxWait);hcParams.setSoTimeout(this.timeout);hcParams.setParameter(HttpMethodParams.RETRY_HANDLER, new DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler(this.retryCount, false));// Initialize global Connection manager parametersHttpConnectionManagerParams cmParams = connMgr.getParams();cmParams.setDefaultMaxConnectionsPerHost(this.maxActive);cmParams.setStaleCheckingEnabled(this.checkStaleConnections);cmParams.setConnectionTimeout(this.timeout);",How to force Commons HTTPClient 3.1 to use TLS 1.2 only for HTTPS?
Primitive Data Types In Java (bit value)," In my Java class we have just learned about of each of the following primitive data types: byteshortintlongSince the long data type contains the most bits, wouldn't it make sense to exclusively use the long data type to avoid restrictions?Questions Is there a particular downside to only using the long data type?

I came up with a solution that I was almost confident was the right answer (because I did it in one line): Surely enough, this code executes the desired result. a == 7 and b == 5.Now here's the funny part.This code won't run in C++ nor is this solution in the back of the book.So my question is: Why exactly does my solution work? I am assuming Java does things differently than other languages? <code>  public static void main(String args[]) { int a = 5; int b = 7; a = b - a + (b = a); System.out.println(""a: "" + a + "" b: "" + b); }",Java assignment operator behavior vs C++
Should I use Spring Secutiry + Hibernate or Hibernate Filters for Access Control?," I am not sure if I'm getting it right what Spring Security is capable of. What my problem is, is that I want to prevent a logged in user to send arbitrary IDs to my server and therefore access data that does not belong to him. But every tutorial I can find is about a simple login procedure. But how can I use that to get rid of in this example: using Spring Annotations? Is that even possible with Spring Security?Another thing that might work would be Hibernate Filters but I am not sure if I want my database to know about security aspects of my data.So I am quite confused about how to do that correctly. Any ideas? <code>  if(item .getStore().getId() == store.getId()) { /* .. */ } // StoreService.java@Transactionalpublic ItemDTO deleteItem(String sessionId, Long storeId, ItemDTO itemDto) { // sessionId is the cookie I have placed in my database // This way I want to ensure that I am only accessing a store // that is associated with the logged in store owner (the user basically) Store store = this.storeOwnerRepository.getStore(sessionId, storeId); Item item = ConvertDTO.convertItem(store, itemDto); // THIS CHECK IS WHAT I WANT TO GET RID OF: // Check if the store ID that I got using the cookie is the // same ID as the store ID from the item that should be deleted if(item.getStore().getId() == store.getId()) { item = this.storeOwnerRepository.deleteItem(item); } else { // If this didn't work we have a potentially hostile user: throw new RuntimeException(""Is somebody trying to delete items from a store he doesn't own?""); } itemDto = ConvertEntity.convertItem(item); return itemDto;}",Hibernate/Spring: Is There Row-Level Security?

Does java -Xmx 1G mean 1 GB or 2^30 B?," And in general, are the units used for the -Xmx, -Xms and -Xmn options (""k"", ""M"" and ""G"", or the less standard possibilities ""K"", ""m"" or ""g"") Binary prefix multiples (i.e. powers of 1024), or are they powers of 1000?The manuals say they represent kilobytes (kB), megabytes (MB) and gigabytes (GB), suggesting they are powers of 1000 as defined in the original SI system. My informal tests (that I'm not very confident about) suggest they are really kibibytes (kiB), mebibytes (MiB) and gibibytes (GiB), all powers of 1024.So which is right? E.g. what Java code would show the current size?Using multiples of 1024 is not surprising for RAM sizes, since RAM is typically physically laid out by doubling up hardware modules. But using units in a clear and standard way is ever more important as we get to bigger and bigger powers, since the potential for confusion grows. The unit ""t"" is also accepted by my JVM, and 1 TiB is 10% bigger than 1 TB.Note: if these really are binary multiples, I suggest updating the documentation and user interfaces to be very clear about that, with examples like ""Append the letter k or K to indicate kibibytes (1024 bytes), or m or M to indicate mebibytes (1048576 bytes)"". That is the approach taken, e.g., in Ubuntu: UnitsPolicy - Ubuntu Wiki.Note: for more on what the options are used for, see e.g. java - What are the Xms and Xmx parameters when starting JVMs?. <code> ",Does java -Xmx1G mean 10^9 or 2^30 bytes?

How to implement 3-way video chat with WebRTC Native Code for Android?," I'm trying to implement 3-way video chat inside an Android app using the WebRTC Native Code package for Android (i.e. not using a WebView). I've written a signalling server using node.js and used the Gottox socket.io java client library inside the client app to connect to the server, exchange SDP packets and establish a 2-way video chat connection.However now I'm having problems going beyond that to a 3-way call. The AppRTCDemo app that comes with the WebRTC native code package demonstrates 2-way calls only (if a 3rd party attempts to join a room a ""room full"" message is returned).According to this answer (which doesn't relate to Android specifically), I'm supposed to do it by creating multiple PeerConnections, so each chat participant will connect to the 2 other participants.However, when I create more than one PeerConnectionClient (a Java class which wraps a PeerConection, which is implemented on the native side in libjingle_peerconnection_so.so), there is an exception thrown from inside the library resulting from a conflict with both of them trying to access the camera: This happens when initializing the local client even before attempting to establish a connection so it's not related to node.js, socket.io or any of the signalling server stuff.How do I get multiple PeerConnections to share the camera so that I can send the same video to more than one peer?One idea I had was to implement some kind of singleton camera class to replace VideoCapturerAndroid that could be shared between multiple connections, but I'm not even sure that would work and I'd like to know if there is a way to do 3-way calls using the API before I start hacking around inside the library.Is it possible and if so, how?Update:I tried sharing a VideoCapturerAndroid object between multiple PeerConnectionClients, creating it for the first connection only and passing it into the initialization function for the subsequent ones, but that resulted in this ""Capturer can only be taken once!"" exception when creating a second VideoTrack from the VideoCapturer object for the second peer connection: Attempting to share the VideoTrack object between PeerConnectionClients resulted in this error from the native code: Sharing the MediaStream between PeerConnectionClients results in the app abruptly closing, without any error message appearing in the Logcat. <code>  E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): startCapture failedE/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): java.lang.RuntimeException: Fail to connect to camera serviceE/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at android.hardware.Camera.native_setup(Native Method)E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at android.hardware.Camera.<init>(Camera.java:548)E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at android.hardware.Camera.open(Camera.java:389)E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at org.webrtc.VideoCapturerAndroid.startCaptureOnCameraThread(VideoCapturerAndroid.java:528)E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at org.webrtc.VideoCapturerAndroid.access$11(VideoCapturerAndroid.java:520)E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at org.webrtc.VideoCapturerAndroid$6.run(VideoCapturerAndroid.java:514)E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:733)E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:95)E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:136)E/VideoCapturerAndroid(21170): at org.webrtc.VideoCapturerAndroid$CameraThread.run(VideoCapturerAndroid.java:484) E/AndroidRuntime(18956): FATAL EXCEPTION: Thread-1397E/AndroidRuntime(18956): java.lang.RuntimeException: Capturer can only be taken once!E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at org.webrtc.VideoCapturer.takeNativeVideoCapturer(VideoCapturer.java:52)E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at org.webrtc.PeerConnectionFactory.createVideoSource(PeerConnectionFactory.java:113)E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at com.example.rtcapp.PeerConnectionClient.createVideoTrack(PeerConnectionClient.java:720)E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at com.example.rtcapp.PeerConnectionClient.createPeerConnectionInternal(PeerConnectionClient.java:482)E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at com.example.rtcapp.PeerConnectionClient.access$20(PeerConnectionClient.java:433)E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at com.example.rtcapp.PeerConnectionClient$2.run(PeerConnectionClient.java:280)E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:733)E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:95)E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:136)E/AndroidRuntime(18956): at com.example.rtcapp.LooperExecutor.run(LooperExecutor.java:56) E/libjingle(19884): Local fingerprint does not match identity.E/libjingle(19884): P2PTransportChannel::Connect: The ice_ufrag_ and the ice_pwd_ are not set.E/libjingle(19884): Local fingerprint does not match identity.E/libjingle(19884): Failed to set local offer sdp: Failed to push down transport description: Local fingerprint does not match identity.",How to implement 3-way conference call video chat with WebRTC Native Code for Android?

Java - Initialise superclass variables (needed in constructor) in a subclass," I'm writing a simple Asteroids-clone game, using Swing to display the graphics. I'm kind of following Derek Banas' tutorials, but decided to expand on my own.The original idea is that every graphic element in the game (i.e. the Asteroids, the Spaceship and the Bullets) extends the Polygon class. Their constructor would look something like this: And it will be similar for the other graphic elements.EDIT: The key element here is that the two arrays don't store the actual coordinates of the objects, but their position relative to their centre, whose coordinates are double-type class-variable. Thus, the arrays describe just the shape of the object, while the subclass move() method will affect the centre's coordinates. The class responsible for the actual drawing will call the move() method and then apply an affine transform to move and rotate the shape (according to a properly defined angle parameter). I'm doing this to avoid precision problems related to dealing with double arithmetic.Now, since the elements share a lot of ""equal"" variables (their centre coordinates, which I need in order to translate them with an affine transform, their speed components etc...) and methods (getters and setters, move() methods, etc...) I thought about making them be the extension of an abstract class - say, GameShape - which holds all these common methods and variables. GameShape would now be the one extending Polygon directly: Then, I'd want to assign the desired value to polyXArray and polyYArray when I define the different subclasses in order to draw the different shapes I need, but I haven't been able to find a way to do it.I do want those variable to be static because they are specific properties of the single classes, and I wouldn't want to pass them as a parameter every time I instantiate a new object.My situation is very similar to the one described in this question, but the proposed solution doesn't seem to work, since I need those very variables in the constructor. Is there a way to get over - or around - this problem? Regardless of the procedure, my main aim is to have a superclass common to all the graphic elements, in order to avoid tens of lines of copy-pasted code.  <code>  public class SpaceShip extends Polygon { //x and y coordinates public static int[] polyXArray = {...}; public static int[] polyYArray = {...}; //other class variables {...} public SpaceShip() { super(polyXArray, polyYArray, polyXArray.length); }} public abstract class GameShape extends Polygon { //x and y coordinates, still unassigned public static int[] polyXArray, polyYArray; //other class variables {...} public GameShape() { super(polyXArray, polyYArray, polyXArray.length); }}",Initialize superclass variables (needed in constructor) in a subclass
Java - Initialize superclass variables (needed in constructor) in a subclass," I'm writing a simple Asteroids-clone game, using Swing to display the graphics. I'm kind of following Derek Banas' tutorials, but decided to expand on my own.The original idea is that every graphic element in the game (i.e. the Asteroids, the Spaceship and the Bullets) extends the Polygon class. Their constructor would look something like this: And it will be similar for the other graphic elements.EDIT: The key element here is that the two arrays don't store the actual coordinates of the objects, but their position relative to their centre, whose coordinates are double-type class-variable. Thus, the arrays describe just the shape of the object, while the subclass move() method will affect the centre's coordinates. The class responsible for the actual drawing will call the move() method and then apply an affine transform to move and rotate the shape (according to a properly defined angle parameter). I'm doing this to avoid precision problems related to dealing with double arithmetic.Now, since the elements share a lot of ""equal"" variables (their centre coordinates, which I need in order to translate them with an affine transform, their speed components etc...) and methods (getters and setters, move() methods, etc...) I thought about making them be the extension of an abstract class - say, GameShape - which holds all these common methods and variables. GameShape would now be the one extending Polygon directly: Then, I'd want to assign the desired value to polyXArray and polyYArray when I define the different subclasses in order to draw the different shapes I need, but I haven't been able to find a way to do it.I do want those variable to be static because they are specific properties of the single classes, and I wouldn't want to pass them as a parameter every time I instantiate a new object.My situation is very similar to the one described in this question, but the proposed solution doesn't seem to work, since I need those very variables in the constructor.

How can I use @IfActiveProfiles to test if a Profile is active?," So confusingly @IfProfileValue has nothing to do with @Profile or @ActiveProfiles. @Profile tests to see if a profile is active, @ActiveProfiles sets them as active, and @IfProfileValue allows you to check things in Spring Environment. Wut? I'd deprecate all of them and add new ones @IfEnvironment, @IfProfile, and @ActivateProfiles. Commentary aside, how can I use @IfProfileValue to detect whether i have a profile active? I am not using Spring Boot on this project, at this time. Answers should show code, and we will assume that I want the test to run if the profile is activated as @ActiveProfiles( ""test"" ).I tried @IfProfileValue(name = ""activeProfiles"", value = ""test"") but that seems to have the test skipped, which means it's not matching. I'm going to speculate the problem may have to do with the fact that ActiveProfiles is a Collection. <code> ",How can I use @IfProfileValue to test if a Profile is active?

Try-catch-final order of Execution," I am trying to understand how the try-catch-finally execution flow works. There are a couple of solutions from Stack Overflow users regarding their execution flow.One such example is: Code A is going to be executed. If all goes well (i.e. no exceptions get thrown while A is executing), it is going to go to finally, so code C is going to be executed. If an exception is thrown while A is executed, then it will go to B and then finally to C.However, I got different execution flows when I tried it: I am getting two different outputs:First output: However, when I ran the same program for the second time:Second output: What should I conclude from this?

Levenshtein search optimization in Java," I have following working Java code for searching for a word against a list of words and it works perfectly and as expected: Right now when I search for a word like job it returns a list:Output As you can see the output has a lot of related words but has also non-related ones like jakob, jacob etc., which is correct regarding the Levenshtein formula, but I would like to build further and write a method that can fine tune my search so I can get more relevant and related words.I have worked few hours on it and lost my sight of creativity.My Question: Is it possible to fine tune the existing method to return relevant/related words Or should I take another approach Or??? in all cases YES or NO, I appreciated if can get input and inspiration regarding improving searching results?UPDATEAfter asking this question long time back I have not really found a solution and I back to it because it is time where I need a useful answer, it is fine to supply the answer with JAVA code samples, but what is most important is a detailed answer with description of available methods and approaches used to index best and most relevant search results and ignoring none relevant words. I know this is an open and endless area, but I need to have some inspiration to start some where. Note: The oldest answer right now is based on one of the comment inputs and is not helpful (useless), it just sorting the distance, that does not mean getting better search results/quality.So I did distance sorting and the results was like this: so word jobbaser is relevant and jacob/jakob is not relevant, but the distance for jobbaser is bigger than jacob/jakob.

Parse JSON without Java class," I am parsing JSON responses from REST API in Java, but I don't want to create a Java class (POJO) for each response (responses have different data structures and fields). Is there a more generic JSON parser in Java that is similar to the straightforward syntax of JavaScript?

Enable batch inserts in hiberante inside spring boot," I want to insert a large number of entities into cross table. To do that, I want to enable hibernate's batch insert option, so that each insert will add not 1, but 20 or 50 rows at a time.I'm trying to reproduce the results from hibernate's tutorial. I've created a test function that will try to insert 30 customers, just like in example: The Customer class has no generated id. What I'm expecting to see is 2 insert statements, one for 20 records and one for 10 records. However, when I open postgres logs, I see 30 insert statements, each inserting only 1 row. I've double checked that it's possible to insert multiple rows using postgres.I believe that the problem is caused by the hibernate.jdbc.batch_size 20 parameter, which I'm supposed to pass to hibernate. However, since I'm using spring boot, the only configuration file I have is application.properties. So I've tried inserting it there: According to this answer, this should be enough, butI've also tried copying these parameters to the hibernate.properties file inside my jar and supplied the parameter via command line: -Dhibernate.jdbc.batch_size=20 as stated in this documentation.None of this helps.I also can't find a way to read batch size property in my code. It seems that most objects mentioned in hibernate's documentation doesn't exist in spring boot application.How can I enable hibernate's batch insert inside spring boot application?I've created a minimal working example which reproduces the issue:https://github.com/Alexey-/spring-boot-batchAfter receiving the answer from Vlad Mihalcea I realized that yes, in fact batch statements are working, at least on hibernate and jdbc levels.However, postgres logs themselves show very interesting behavior: they are almost identical for the case of batch inserts and normal inserts.What I was initially expecting to see was that hibernate would be using statements like this: Which would produce log records similar to this: However, that's not the case.When batch insertion is enabled (p6spy shows that statements are, in fact, batched), postgres will produce logs similar to this: And when batch statements are disabled (p6spy shows that no batching is performed), logs will looks like this: So, the only difference between the two is when batch is disabled, postgres will take tiny bit more time to realize that it should reuse prepared statements.So I decided to run performance tests to confirm this.I tried inserting 30.000 records into empty database.With batching disabled, it took 334ms.With batching enabled, it took 4650ms! So then I removed all calls to entityManager.flush (leaving only entityManager.clear) and the time dropped to 320ms. I don't know why hibernate's tutorial advises using flush. I guess that's just a mistake.So I guess the bottom line is this: the batching is working, but it doesn't provide any real benefits (at least for postgres). Furthermore, using it improperly (as in tutorial) can lead to a terrible, terrible results. Use at your own risk and always measure real performance increase. <code>  //Batch inserting test entities//This code is inside transaction already, so I'm not creating a new oneentityManager.flush();for (int i = 0; i < 30; ++i) { Customer customer = new Customer(""Customer"" + i, (i + 5) * 1000, ""Position "" + i); entityManager.persist(customer); if (i % 20 == 0) {

inserts with Hibernate and Spring Boot
Enable batch inserts in Hibernate inside Spring-Boot," I want to insert a large number of entities into cross table. To do that, I want to enable hibernate's batch insert option, so that each insert will add not 1, but 20 or 50 rows at a time.I'm trying to reproduce the results from hibernate's tutorial. I've created a test function that will try to insert 30 customers, just like in example: The Customer class has no generated id. What I'm expecting to see is 2 insert statements, one for 20 records and one for 10 records. However, when I open postgres logs, I see 30 insert statements, each inserting only 1 row. I've double checked that it's possible to insert multiple rows using postgres.I believe that the problem is caused by the hibernate.jdbc.batch_size 20 parameter, which I'm supposed to pass to hibernate. However, since I'm using spring boot, the only configuration file I have is application.properties. So I've tried inserting it there: According to this answer, this should be enough, butI've also tried copying these parameters to the hibernate.properties file inside my jar and supplied the parameter via command line: -Dhibernate.jdbc.batch_size=20 as stated in this documentation.None of this helps.I also can't find a way to read batch size property in my code. It seems that most objects mentioned in hibernate's documentation doesn't exist in spring boot application.How can I enable hibernate's batch insert inside spring boot application?I've created a minimal working example which reproduces the issue:https://github.com/Alexey-/spring-boot-batchAfter receiving the answer from Vlad Mihalcea I realized that yes, in fact batch statements are working, at least on hibernate and jdbc levels.However, postgres logs themselves show very interesting behavior: they are almost identical for the case of batch inserts and normal inserts.What I was initially expecting to see was that hibernate would be using statements like this: Which would produce log records similar to this: However, that's not the case.When batch insertion is enabled (p6spy shows that statements are, in fact, batched), postgres will produce logs similar to this: And when batch statements are disabled (p6spy shows that no batching is performed), logs will looks like this: So, the only difference between the two is when batch is disabled, postgres will take tiny bit more time to realize that it should reuse prepared statements.So I decided to run performance tests to confirm this.I tried inserting 30.000 records into empty database.With batching disabled, it took 334ms.With batching enabled, it took 4650ms! So then I removed all calls to entityManager.flush (leaving only entityManager.clear) and the time dropped to 320ms. I don't know why hibernate's tutorial advises using flush. I guess that's just a mistake.So I guess the bottom line is this: the batching is working, but it doesn't provide any real benefits (at least for postgres). Furthermore, using it improperly (as in tutorial) can lead to a terrible, terrible results. Use at your own risk and always measure real performance increase. <code>  //Batch inserting test entities//This code is inside transaction already, so I'm not creating a new oneentityManager.flush();for (int i = 0; i < 30; ++i) { Customer customer = new Customer(""Customer"" + i, (i + 5) * 1000, ""Position "" + i); entityManager.persist(customer); if (i % 20 == 0) {

Inward spiral tree traversal," I came across an interesting problem: Given a binary tree print it in inward spiral order i.e first print level 1, then level n, then level 2, then n-1 and so on. I have thought of a solution:Store each level elements in a listlists[0] = [1]lists[1] = [2, 3]lists[2] = [4, 5, 6, 7]lists[3] = [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]Loop through the list of lists in the order required (0, n-1, 1, n-2, ...) and print. Here n is the number of levels which is 4 in the above case. Its space complexity would be O(n). I am sure there might be a better solution to it with a better space complexity, but I cannot think if it. Anyone has any pointers? <code>  For Ex:12 34 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15Should Output:1 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 2 3 7 6 5 4",Inward spiral tree traversal

Best methodology to test against multiple java versions," I have multiple unit tests and component tests which I would like to test against several versions of Java (1.6, 1.7, 1.8, etc).I wonder whats the best methodology to it?Should I run tests several times using Jenkins and each time I change the path of the JAVA_HOME variable to a different JRE?Can I do using Maven plugin? Maybe different profiles?In addition, is there a way using TestNG to exclude tests based on the JRE version? I can handle it using an if statement on a the java.version system property, however I wonder if theres a more elegant way.In case this will affect the answer, I would like to mention that looking forward I would like to test it against several OS types and multiple versions of the product (same tests against v1.0, v2.0, etc). <code> ",Best methodology to test against multiple Java versions
Add letters of a given string to a list but add only 1 time each letter," I want to add a String's letters to a list, but I only want to add each letter once.

Spring Boot restore @ControllerAdvice (aka remove basicErrorController)," I had the following controller advice set up, to return an APIs contract for error conditions: It was working fine and then stopped working. Now all exceptions are routed to BasicErrorController, which returns the following format: The above is a nice opinionated starting point, but now it won't get out of the way. I've tried replacing the error handlers with one instance of ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver but that didn't work. I've tried making my own CustomErrorHandler, but that also wasn't suitable since the original exception is no longer in the HttpServletRequest by the time it re-routes to the custom error controller. This information is needed in order to return an appropriate response to the client. How to I:Make SpringBoot not forward exceptions to an exception controller. Restore @ControllerAdvice exception handlers, so that I can just return an appropriate response body and status code. On startup spring logs: Edit:After reading through the Spring Boot docs, I under stand now that the BasicErrorController is only supposed to fire for any exceptions not handled by a @ControllerAdvice. This appears not to be happening. So the question is why?  <code>  @ControllerAdvicepublic class ExceptionHandler : ResponseEntityExceptionHandler(){ @ExceptionHandler(Throwable::class) @ResponseBody public fun onException(ex: Throwable): ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> { val errorResponse = ErrorResponse( response = ResponseHeader(ex.responseCode(), ex.message)) return ResponseEntity(errorResponse, HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED); }} { ""timestamp"" : 1450495303166, ""status"" : 403, ""error"" : ""Forbidden"", ""message"" : ""Access Denied"", ""path"" : ""/profile/candidates""} main] .m.m.a.ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver : Detected @ExceptionHandler methods in exceptionHandlermain] .m.m.a.ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver : Detected @ExceptionHandler methods in responseEntityExceptionHandler",Spring Boot @ControllerAdvice exception handler not firing
Retrofit2/OkHttp: Cancel all running requests," I'm using Retrofit 2-beta2 with OkHttp 2.7.0.To get the OkHttpClient object from Retrofit I'm using the Retrofit .client() method and to cancel all it's running requests, I'm calling it's cancel(Object tag) method but the requests still keep running and I get a response.Even the client's Dispatcher's getQueuedCallCount() and getRunningCallCount() return 0 after calling cancel().Is there anything else that I need to do for this to work?

Alternate way to specify an additional bound when first bound is a type parameter," I know that specifying an additional bound when the first bound is a type parameter is not possible in Java; however, I was wondering if anybody knows an alternate way to do something similar and to keep it safe at compile time? I've provided an example below.In the following code what I'm referring to is this: <E extends T & Comparable<T>>. In this situation, I want to be able to use the inbuilt comparator if the type of T is comparable, otherwise, I want to specify my own comparator.Is there any alternate way to do this while keeping type-safety at compile time? <code>  public class ExampleClass<T, U> { [...] public <E extends T & Comparable<T>> ExampleClass(Function<U, E> function) { this.function = function; this.comparator = (E a, E b) -> a.compareTo(b); } public ExampleClass(Function<U, T> function, Comparator<U> comparator) { this.function = function; this.comparator = comparator; }}",Is there an alternate way to specify an additional bound when first bound is a type parameter?

How to inject Dagger 2 class into serialized object on Android?," I'm trying to integrate Retrofit 2 and Android Priority Job Queue by using Dagger 2.It's likely I'm using the wrong pattern here (I'm new to Java and Android), but I'm trying to access a Dagger-created Retrofit instance from an object that will be serialized then deserialized before execution (Android Job Queue serializes jobs that are persisted to disk). The Retrofit instance is created by an Application Dagger component, because I'm using SharedPreferences in one of its dependencies.I can't pass Retrofit to the job when it's created because Retrofit itself cannot be serialized.Application also can't be serialized, so I can't reference the Application Dagger component from the job when it runs (since I cannot inject with ((MyApplication) myApplication).component().inject(this); like I can do from Activities, because the Application object doesn't exist in the deserialized job.)I want to use the Retrofit instance used by the rest of the app for efficiency instead of creating another instance just for the job. Is it even possible?I'm not sure if using Provider<T> or a Factory might help because that's beyond my understanding right now, but I'd love a hint about how to structure things if that's the case!EDIT: This how you create a job with Android Priority Job Queue. I've modified a sample to indicate how I'd like the injection to be working. The job is serialized on onAdded() and deserialized before it's run with onRun(): <code>  // A job to send a tweetpublic class PostTweetJob extends Job { @Inject MyService webservice; public static final int PRIORITY = 1; private String text; public PostTweetJob(String text) { // This job requires network connectivity, // and should be persisted in case the application exits before job is completed. super(new Params(PRIORITY).requireNetwork().persist()); } @Override public void onAdded() { // Job has been saved to disk. } @Override public void onRun() throws Throwable { // Job logic goes here webservice.postTweet(text); } @Override protected void onCancel() { // Clean up }}",How do I inject an object into Android Priority Job Queue with Dagger 2?
Jackson. Deserialize missing properties as empty Optional," Let's say I have a class like this: If I deserialize this JSON, I get an empty Optional: But if property is missing (in this case just empty JSON), I get null instead of Optional<T>. I could initialize fields by myself of course, but I think it would be better to have one mechanism for null and missing properties. So is there a way to make jackson deserialize missing properties as empty Optional<T>? <code>  public static class Test { private Optional<String> something; public Optional<String> getSomething() { return something; } public void setSomething(Optional<String> something) { this.something = something; } } {""something"":null}",Jackson.

Is there a reason why catching checked exceptions is allowed for code that does not throws exceptions?," In Java, methods that throw checked exceptions (Exception or its subtypes - IOException, InterruptedException, etc) must declare throws statement: Methods that do not declare throws statement can't throw checked exceptions. But catching checked exceptions in safe methods is still legal in java: Actually, no. It's a bit funny: compiler knows that e is not a checked exception and allows to rethrow it. Things are even a bit ridiculous, this code does not compile: The first snippet was a motivation for a question. Compiler knows that checked exceptions can't be thrown inside a safe method - so maybe it should allow to catch only unchecked exceptions?Returning to the main question - are there any reasons to implement catching checked exceptions in this way? Is it just a flaw in the design or am I missing some important factors - maybe backward incompatibilities? What could potentially go wrong if only RuntimeException were allowed to be catched in this scenario? Examples are greatly appreciated. <code>  public abstract int read() throws IOException; public int read() { // does not compile throw new IOException();}// Error: unreported exception java.io.IOException; must be caught or declared to be thrown public void safeMethod() { System.out.println(""I'm safe""); }public void test() { // method guarantees not to throw checked exceptions try { safeMethod(); } catch (Exception e) { // catching checked exception java.lang.Exception throw e; // so I can throw... a checked Exception? }} public void test() { // guarantees not to throw checked exceptions try { safeMethod(); } catch (Exception e) { throw (Exception) e; // seriously? }}// Error: unreported exception java.lang.Exception; must be caught or declared to be thrown",Why is catching checked exceptions allowed for code that does not throw exceptions?

Horrendous performance & large heap footprint of java 8 constructor reference?," I just had a rather unpleasant experience in our production environment, causing OutOfMemoryErrors: heapspace..I traced the issue to my use of ArrayList::new in a function.To verify that this is actually performing worse than normal creation via a declared constructor (t -> new ArrayList<>()), I wrote the following small method: Running the method with newMethod=true; will cause the method to fail with OutOfMemoryError just after index hits 30k. With newMethod=false; the program does not fail, but keeps pounding away until killed (index easily reaches 1.5 milion).Why does ArrayList::new create so many Object[] elements on the heap that it causes OutOfMemoryError so fast?(By the way - it also happens when the collection type is HashSet.) <code>  public class TestMain { public static void main(String[] args) { boolean newMethod = false; Map<Integer,List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>(); int index = 0; while(true){ if (newMethod) { map.computeIfAbsent(index, ArrayList::new).add(index); } else { map.computeIfAbsent(index, i->new ArrayList<>()).add(index); } if (index++ % 100 == 0) { System.out.println(""Reached index ""+index); } } }}",Horrendous performance & large heap footprint of Java 8 constructor reference?

Can a Thread sleep for less than half milli seconds in Java?," [Edit]: After getting answer I understood its not specific to Java, its related to OS scheduler as well, so adding other tagsIs it possible in Java to make a thread sleep for a nano seconds.Of course after looking the Thread api where we can pass nano seconds as well in sleep method, the answer could be yes.But I doubt after looking the implementation/ source of sleep method in Thread class, which is: Now according to the logic it is increasing milli seconds by 1 if the passed nano seconds is more than half milli seconds. But this sounds illogical to me, lets say I have written a code where one of my thread is waiting for say some 40000 nano seconds (in practical scenario it might not be the case) which is less than half milli seconds that means my thread will not wait at all.Can someone please comment on the same and why this design was decided to wait for milli seconds rather than nano seconds?Also what would guarantee that the thread wakes up accurately? <code>  public static void sleep(long millis, int nanos)throws InterruptedException { if (millis < 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(""timeout value is negative""); } if (nanos < 0 || nanos > 999999) { throw new IllegalArgumentException( ""nanosecond timeout value out of range""); } if (nanos >= 500000 || (nanos != 0 && millis == 0)) { millis++; } sleep(millis);}",Can a Thread sleep for less than half milli seconds in Java/ Other language?

Is there any instruction reordering done by the Hotspot JIT comipler that we can reproduce?," As we know, some JIT allows reordering for object initialization, for example, can be decomposed into below steps: JIT compiler may reorder it as below: namely, step2 and step3 can be reordered by JIT compiler.Even though this is theoretically valid reordering, I was unable to reproduce it with Hotspot(jdk1.7) under x86 platform.So, Is there any instruction reordering done by the Hotspot JIT comipler that can be reproduced?Update: I did the test on my machine(Linux x86_64,JDK 1.8.0_40, i5-3210M ) using below command: and I can see the tool reported something like: [1] 5 ACCEPTABLE The object is published, at least 1 field is visible.That meant an observer thread saw an uninitialized instance of MyObject. However,I did NOT see assembly code generated like @Ivan's: There seems to be no compiler reordering here. Update2:@Ivan corrected me. I used wrong JIT command to capture the assembly code.After fixing this error, I can grap below assembly code: Apparently, the compiler did the reordering which caused an unsafe publication. <code>  someRef = new SomeObject(); objRef = allocate space for SomeObject; //step1call constructor of SomeObject; //step2someRef = objRef; //step3 objRef = allocate space for SomeObject; //step1someRef = objRef; //step3call constructor of SomeObject; //step2 java -XX:-UseCompressedOops -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:CompileCommand=""print org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.unsafe.UnsafePublication::publish"" -XX:CompileCommand=""inline, org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.unsafe.UnsafePublication::publish"" -XX:PrintAssemblyOptions=intel -jar tests-custom/target/jcstress.jar -f -1 -t .*UnsafePublication.* -v > log.txt 0x00007f71d4a15e34: mov r11d,DWORD PTR [rbp+0x10] ;getfield x 0x00007f71d4a15e38: mov DWORD PTR [rax+0x10],r11d ;putfield x00 0x00007f71d4a15e3c: mov DWORD PTR [rax+0x14],r11d ;putfield x01 0x00007f71d4a15e40: mov DWORD PTR [rax+0x18],r11d ;putfield x02 0x00007f71d4a15e44: mov DWORD PTR [rax+0x1c],r11d ;putfield x03 0x00007f71d4a15e48: mov QWORD PTR [rbp+0x18],rax ;putfield o 0x00007f76012b18d5: mov DWORD PTR [rax+0x10],ebp ;*putfield x000x00007f76012b18d8: mov QWORD PTR [r8+0x18],rax ;*putfield o ; - org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.unsafe.generated.UnsafePublication_jcstress$Runner_publish::call@94 (line 156)0x00007f76012b18dc: mov DWORD PTR [rax+0x1c],ebp ;*putfield x03",Is there any instruction reordering done by the Hotspot JIT compiler that can be reproduced?

Java: sorting an array of filenames containing strings with numbers," For my project I need to download a zip file from an FTP server, which releases a new zip about 13 times a year. I need to download the latest file following the server's naming convention:Prefix + release number (one or two digits) + year (two digits) + suffix + "".zip""for instance: ALFP1016F.zipThe prefix will always be the same (ALFP) and the suffix either F or P (stands for ""full"" or ""partial""; I need only the files ending with suffix F). On top of that, there are several other files in the directory I need to ignore because they have different prefixes. Then, I need to get the most recent file in the array following this priority order:Most recent year. Of course '99 should not be seen as the most recent year.Most recent release numberFor instance, if I have this listing of filenames (full server directory): My expected output would be ALFP716F.zip because 16 is the most recent year, and 7 the most recent release number from that year.Here's what I've done so far: I have done a miserable attempt at writing the returnMostRecent(String[]) method, but ended up with an unintelligible mess not worth being posted here.How can I sort this array and effectively return the most recent file following my priority order? <code>  1stpage712.pdf1stpage914.pdfALFP1015F.zipALFP1015P.zipALFP716F.zipALFP716P.zipFSFP816F.zipFSFP816P.zip //necessary importsimport org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTP;import org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPClient;import org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPFile;//initialize FTP clientftpClient = new FTPClient();try { //connect to server ftpClient.connect(server, port); ftpClient.login(username, password); ftpClient.enterLocalPassiveMode(); ftpClient.setFileType(FTP.BINARY_FILE_TYPE); //list all names from server String[]filenames = ftpClient.listNames(); //return expected file name String expectedFileName = returnMostRecent(filenames);} catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { try { if (ftpClient.isConnected()) { ftpClient.logout(); ftpClient.disconnect(); System.out.println(""Disconnected from server""); } } catch (IOException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); }}",Sorting an array of filenames containing strings with numbers

Why JVM requires warmup?," I understand that in the Java virtual machine (JVM), warmup is potentially required as Java loads classes using a lazy loading process and as such you want to ensure that the objects are initialized before you start the main transactions. I am a C++ developer and have not had to deal with similar requirements.However, the parts I am not able to understand are the following:Which parts of the code should you warm up? Even if I warm up some parts of the code, how long does it remain warm (assuming this term only means how long your class objects remain in-memory)? How does it help if I have objects which need to be created each time I receive an event?Consider for an example an application that is expected to receive messages over a socket and the transactions could be New Order, Modify Order and Cancel Order or transaction confirmed.Note that the application is about High Frequency Trading (HFT) so performance is of extreme importance. <code> ",Why does the JVM require warmup?

And is it useful?CLARIFICATION FOR DOWNVOTERSI understand what it means when the T is used in the method parameters, like this: The return type is inferrable from the class that's passed in.But when you have no parameters to say what type T is, what type is it? <code>  <T> T get(); T get(Class<T> clazz);","What does ""<T> T get()"" mean?

localdatetime to zoneddatetime," I have Java 8 Spring web app that will support multiple regions. I need to make calendar events for a customer location. So lets say my web and Postgres server is hosted in MST timezone (but I guess it could be anywhere if we go cloud). But the customer is in EST. So, following some best practices I read, I thought I would store all date times in UTC format. All date time fields in the database are declared as TIMESTAMP.So here is how I take a LocalDateTime and convert to UTC: Now , for example, when a search for a date comes in, I have to convert from the requested date time to UTC, get the results and convert to the user timezone (stored in the db): Now, I am not sure this is the correct approach. I also wonder if because I am going from LocalDateTime to ZonedDateTime and vice versa, I might be losing any timezone info.Here is what I am seeing and it doesn't seem correct to me. When I receive the LocalDateTime from the UI, I get this: The ZonedDateTime = And then when I assign that converted value to my appointment LocalDateTime I store: I feel like because I am storing in LocalDateTime I am losing the timezone that I converted into ZonedDateTime.Should I make my entity (appointment) use ZonedDateTime instead of LocalDateTime so that Postgres doesn't loose that information?---------------- Edit ---------------- After Basils excellent answer, I realized that I have the luxury of not caring of the users timezone - all appointments are against a specific location so I can store all date times as UTC and then convert them to the location timezone when retrieved. I made the following followup question <code>  ZonedDateTime startZonedDT = ZonedDateTime.ofLocal(dto.getStartDateTime(), ZoneOffset.UTC, null);//appointment startDateTime is a LocalDateTimeappointment.setStartDateTime( startZonedDT.toLocalDateTime() ); ZoneId userTimeZone = ZoneId.of(timeZone.getID());ZonedDateTime startZonedDT = ZonedDateTime.ofLocal(appointment.getStartDateTime(), userTimeZone, null);dto.setStartDateTime( startZonedDT.toLocalDateTime() ); 2016-04-04T08:00 dateTime=2016-04-04T08:00offset=""Z""zone=""Z"" 2016-04-04T08:00",LocalDateTime to ZonedDateTime

Read whole text files from a compression (tgz) in Spark (with Java)," I have the following problem: suppose that I have a directory containing compressed directories which contain multiple files, stored on HDFS. I want to create an RDD consisting some objects of type T, i.e.: Now when inputDataPath is a directory containing files this works perfectly fine, i.e. when it's something like: But, when there's a tgz containing multiple files, the file content (fileNameContent._2()) gets me some useless binary string (quite expected). I found a similar question on SO, but it's not the same case, because there the solution is when each compression consists of one file only, and in my case there are many other files which I want to read individually as whole files. I also found a question about wholeTextFiles, but this doesn't work in my case.Any ideas how to do this? EDIT:I tried with the reader from here (trying to test the reader from here, like in the function testTarballWithFolders()), but whenever I call and I get NullPointerException: The line 105 in MainSpark is the one I showed upper in my edit of the post, and line 61 from TarballReader is which gives a null value for the input stream in in the upper line: Am I on the right path here?

Concatenate string values with delimiter handling null and empty strings in java 8?," In Java 8 I have some number of String values and I want to end up with a comma delimited list of valid values. If a String is null or empty I want to ignore it. I know this seems common and is a lot like this old question; however, that discussion does not address nulls AND spaces (I also don't like the accepted answer).I've looked at Java 8 StringJoiner, Commons StringUtils (join) and trusty Guava (Joiner) but none seems like a full solution. The vision: ...would result in niceString = a,bIsn't there a nice way to do this (that doesn't involve for loops, loading strings into a list, and/or regex replaces to remove bad entries)? <code>  where: val1 = ""a"", val2 = null, val3 = """", val4 = ""b"" String niceString = StringJoiner.use("","").ignoreBlanks().ignoreNulls() .add(val1).add(val2).add(val3).add(val4).toString();",Concatenate string values with delimiter handling null and empty strings?

Collectors.toSet() returns always a HashSet ? Why the contract?," Javadoc says Returns a Collector that accumulates the input elements into a new Set.

Different between @Interceptors and @InterceptorBinding + @Logged?," Seems there are two ways to binding interceptor to target class/method:@Interceptors on target class/methodDeclare a interceptor binding type(aka, a custom annotation annotated with @InterceptorBinding itself, for example @Logged), and using it on target class/methodI am using interceptor in CDI environment. My question is, does it is completely unnecessary to declare a extra interceptor binding type if I using @Interceptors to binding interceptor to my target methods? If answer is yes, then why IntelliJ IDEA constantly complaint me a error @Interceptor must specify at least one interceptor bindingwhen I am not annotating interceptor binding type on my interceptor? If answer is no, I already binding my interceptor to target class/method with @Interceptors(arrayOfMyInceptor) directly, why declare a extra interceptor binding type and using it on my interceptor?I search the web but cannt found anything about difference of this two approaches, hope SO can solve my problem.Thank you for your patience. <code> ",Differences between @Interceptors and @InterceptorBinding + @Logged?
Limit java memory consumption in a Docker container," I've got a Spring Boot application implementing a service which I want to run in a Docker container. I've followed the guideline of the official Spring docs which suggest to create a DockerFile similar to this: Then once the image is pushed to Docker I use Docker Compose to launch it this way: Here I've got the JAVA_OPTS variable which limits the memory allocation, however, when I execute docker stats spring-boot-docker, the memory taken by the container is excessive (I understand the total memory taken by the JVM might be much more than 64M, but in this case is totally boundless).I've also tried with the mem_limit param, but this slows down the application noticeably. <code>  FROM frolvlad/alpine-oraclejdk8:slimVOLUME /tmpADD gs-spring-boot-docker-0.1.0.jar app.jarRUN sh -c 'touch /app.jar'ENTRYPOINT [""java"",""-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom"",""-jar"",""/app.jar""] spring-boot-docker: ports: - ""80:80"" expose: - ""80"" image: my-repo/spring-boot-docker:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT container_name: spring-boot-docker environment: JAVA_OPTS: '-Xmx64m'",Limit JVM memory consumption in a Docker container
Should I read from a Redis slave?," We have a cluster configuration for Redis used as cache.Now due to the normal pattern of write to master and read from slave (with other databases), we are trying to do the same thing with Redis cluster.After some investigation we found that none of the Redis clients (in java) like redisson, jedis and Spring Data Redis support this.We seem to have found some workaround for it but it seems ugly and now I am thinking if it is worth it?Here is my use caseApprox highest QPS: 1000Payload size: huge 1 MB max (after compression)Cluster size 3 master each with 2 slaves(pretty high spec machines)Cringe part: the actual network bandwidth to this cluster is Max 1GB (1 GB separately for intra-cluster talk)With that in mind I have following questions:Will it (reading from slave) help me in any way?Are there any pit holes I should avoid (any special server side config)?Is the narrow path going to be a problem?Is there a standard way (library/client) for doing this correctly Any help (blogs, case study, suggestions) is greatly appreciated. <code> ",Should I read from a Redis Cluster slave?

import csv in h2 (dynamically!)," I'm searching for a solution to Import any csv file with Java (or SQL computed with a Java application at runtime) in a h2 database. a possibility could be to write at first a dynamic file and run the ""script"" on h2 databse connection after creation.my main Problem is that i create the csv files dynamically and the column number and Label values can differ. the Environment for getting Connection, run a scribt on h2 and create the files during application is running are still exists.for now i found many Solutions if i know the csv structure but i didn't can know it before. another Problem is that the typ is not ever sure(if it is easier to find a solution let as say all are double.the reason why i Need this is, that i wanna Show the dataset in a graph (linechart). sometimes i Need the first two rows as x axis. sometimes i have to Show one line sometimes more(so in csv there are one ylabel or more)the reason why I wanna have this data in a database is i ever wanna Show min max and avg of this set based on the x axis criteria. (smt. Show per month, day, week). so the idea is to set a date Format by creating the data and by reading for the Chart i Group by DATE(DATE,TIME), the data.examples:my base csv example so sometimes my resulting csv seems like: or like this: or this: We can be sure that all lines have same length. labels are at first line. I hope you get the idea. if you have a better solution to solve it i also would listen to that!(sry for the style have no idea how to make a table)thanks for any command! <code>  DATE,TIME,label1 , y2 ,line3 ,...

JavaFX FXML Combobox CSS issue," I am building a small application with JavaFX + FXML and I'm trying to implement some simple CSS to have a specific style.I have an issue with the Combobox element. Indeed by default its color is grey:And I would like to have it white (or transparent), and keep the borders, to match the same style as the Text Field. So I tried to set the background color to transparent but there is a side effect: The borders become transparent too!Here is the CSS i have added: I am not at all used to CSS writing, so maybe I completely miss something out. Is it that the combobox does not define borders?

why use ThreadLocal in java," ThreadLocal in Java says that: The ThreadLocal class in Java enables you to create variables that can only be read and written by the same thread. Thus, even if two threads are executing the same code, and the code has a reference to a ThreadLocal variable, then the two threads cannot see each other's ThreadLocal variables.My question is: When we need to get a variable specific to a thread, can't we just declare that variable as a local variable inside a method? Because every thread has its own stack and thus it gets its own copy of variables. Am I missing something here? <code> ",When is ThreadLocal preferred over Local Variables?

If this class object represents a reference type that is not an array type then the binary name of the class is returned, as specified by The Java Language Specification.""getTypeName(): ""Return an informative string for the name of this type.""It's fairly obvious that I don't want either of these:getSimpleName(): ""Returns the simple name of the underlying class as given in the source code.""toString(): ""The string representation is the string ""class"" or ""interface"", followed by a space, and then by the fully qualified name of the class in the format returned by getName""I don't expect this to work for primitive types. It's okay if it won't work for arrays. The main thing I'm concerned about is nested classes and Foo.Bar vs. Foo$Bar. <code>  Object o = ...;String oTypeName = o.getClass().getName();//on the other side of the wire:Class<?> oClass = Class.forName(oTypeName);Object oAgain = oClass.newInstance();",Which java.lang.Class method generates the right input for Class.forName()?
modifying amazon's avs java client sample app to use wav files (not just microphone recording)," In general I wanna use the amazon's avs sdk for Alexa to parse audio files and not just microphone recording.using OSX 10.11.6.So first I downloaded Alexa Voice Service Sample App from https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/java-client-sampleThen I configured and executed the companionService (nodejs) and then the java client and it works.. I say stuff on the microphone and Alexa responds. now I want to add a capability to load sound and play it from the computer instead of just the microphone.So first I created a function to add a button to the UI.so I edited samples/javaclient/src/main/java/com/amazon/alexa/avs/AVSApp.java. I duplicated the function that adds the ""Start Listening"" button and modified it: Then I added the execution of this function in the private AVSApp function: ok now... in my new addBrowseField() function I'm calling a new function I created in the controller called startFileRecording.so I modified samples/javaclient/src/main/java/com/amazon/alexa/avs/AVSController.javaby copying the startRecording function to startFileLoading and modifying it: Now as you can see, I use the file eli3.raw. I recorded myself saying a command (only audio) and converted it to LPCM with ffmpeg -i eli.m4a -f s16le -ac 1 -acodec pcm_s16le eli3.rawSo I click the newly created Browse button that actually loads the eli3.raw audio file, and a few seconds I click the Stop Browse button and nothing really happens.I get no java errors, no warning no nothing.I'm pretty new to the all avs sdk so I'm probably doing something wrong.. just no idea what. <code>  private void addBrowseField() { final RecordingRMSListener rmsListener = this; browseButton = new JButton(BROWSE_LABEL); browseButton.setEnabled(true); browseButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { controller.onUserActivity(); if (browseButton.getText().equals(BROWSE_LABEL)) { // if in idle mode browseButton.setText(BROWSE_STOP_LABEL); RequestListener requestListener = new RequestListener() { @Override public void onRequestSuccess() { finishProcessing(); } @Override public void onRequestError(Throwable e) { log.error(""An error occured creating speech request"", e); JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(getContentPane(), e.getMessage(), ""Error"", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE); browseButton.doClick(); finishProcessing(); } }; controller.startFileLoading(""/Users/ufk/Desktop/eli3.raw"", requestListener); // controller.stopRecording(); /// stop the recording so the request can complete } else { browseButton.setText(BROWSE_LABEL); controller.stopRecording(); } } }); getContentPane().add(browseButton);} private AVSApp(DeviceConfig config) throws Exception {... addBrowseField();...} public void startFileLoading(String path,RequestListener requestListener) { try { InputStream in = (InputStream)new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(new File(path))); String dialogRequestId = dialogRequestIdAuthority.createNewDialogRequestId(); RequestBody body = RequestFactory.createSpeechRegonizerRecognizeRequest(dialogRequestId, PROFILE, FORMAT, player.getPlaybackState(), player.getSpeechState(), alertManager.getState(), player.getVolumeState()); dependentQueue.clear(); avsClient.sendEvent(body, in, requestListener, AUDIO_TYPE); speechRequestAudioPlayerPauseController.startSpeechRequest(); } catch (Exception e) { player.playMp3FromResource(ERROR_SOUND); requestListener.onRequestError(e); }}",Using Amazon's avs SDK for Alexa to parse Audio files
jmh indicates that M1 is faster than M2 but M1 delegates to M2," I wrote a JMH benchmark involving 2 methods: M1 and M2. M1 invokes M2 but for some reason, JMH claims that M1 is faster than M2.Here is the benchmark source-code: In the above example, M1 is assertThat(), M2 is requireThat(). Meaning, assertThat() invokes requireThat() under the hood.Here is the benchmark output: To reproduce this locally:Create a Maven project containing the above benchmark.Add the following dependency: Alternatively, download the library from https://github.com/cowwoc/requirements.java/I have the following questions:Can you reproduce this result on your end?What, if anything, is wrong with the benchmark?UPDATE: I posted an updated benchmark source-code, benchmark output, jmh-test output and xperfasm output to https://bitbucket.org/cowwoc/requirements/downloads per Aleksey Shipilev's suggestion. I cannot post these to Stackoverflow due to the 30k character limit on questions.UPDATE2: I am finally getting consistent, meaningful results.

Specyfing java version in maven - differences beetwen properties and compiler plugin," I'm not very experienced with Maven and while experimenting with multi-module project I started wondering how can I specify Java version for all my child modules in parent Maven pom. Until today I was using just: ...but when researching I found that you can also specify Java version in Maven compiler plugin, like that: And then wrap this into plugin management tag to enable child poms usage of this.

Are there any differences between setting source/target in properties and in Maven plugin configuration element?Some other questions are - which way should be used (and when if they are not equal)?

Need help to fix an error," I can't figure out why the following won't compile. The error the IDE gives me is ""The value for annotation attribute RequestParam.defaultValue must be a constant expression"".My project involves Spring and Maven, and it goes the following: I'm thinking the error comes from the conversion of Long to String, but I do not know how to fix it. I will appreciate any help, I am new to annotations and Spring. <code>  private static final String MAX_LONG_AS_STRING = Long.toString(Long.MAX_VALUE);@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET)public List<Spittle> spittles( @RequestParam(value=""max"", defaultValue=MAX_LONG_AS_STRING) long max, @RequestParam(value=""count"", defaultValue=""20"") int count) { return spittleRepository.findSpittles(max, count);}",Java code won't compile due to attribute must be a constant expression error
Why this unit test fail when I compare 2 BigDecimal representing the same value?," I have the following same strange situation into a JUnit test.So I have this test method: At the end I am simply testing if the tirAliquotaRamoI.getAliquota() (obtained from a DB query) have the same value of the same field defined for the created expectedObject: So the field for the expected object is created using the BigDecimal.ONE constand and using the debugger I can see that its value is 1.And the tirAliquotaRamoI.getAliquota() obtaind value is 1.000000000So, in theory, both represent the same value 1 but the test fail and I obtain: Why if both represent the ame 1.0 value?

What is This Giant Int[] JVM Overhead?," I know there is an intrinsic overhead of the JVM, and I wanted to do further research to see exactly what the overhead is from.Using the YourKit profiler I was able to find that there are giant int[] filled with seemingly random information. My guess was that these store some performance metrics and other things that the JVM uses to optimize applications; but to my surprise all the elements are value 0.To get my results I used the following ""do nothing"" program, so that the results only include things happening on the JVM. This is a screenshot of the profiling result, and I can upload a memory snapshot if necessary. <code>  public final class Main { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE); }}",Why does the JVM use giant int[] of all 0's?

RxJava instead of AsyncTask; Pros and Cons, I came across several instances when people were trying to persuade me into using RxJava instead of Android's standard AsyncTask construct.In my opinion RxJava offers a lot more features but loses in simplicity against AsyncTask.Are there any use cases that suit one approach better than the other or even more general can RxJava even be considered superior? <code> ,RxJava instead of AsyncTask?

Java synchronised method around parameter value," Consider the following method: I want to protect this method from race conditions, but this can only occur if two threads with the same customerId are calling it at the same time. If I make the whole method synchronized it will reduce the efficiency and it's not really needed. What I really want is to synchronize it around the customerId. Is this possible somehow with Java? Are there any built-in tools for that or I'd need a Map of Integers to use as locks?Also feel free to advice if you think I'm doing something wrong here :)Thanks! <code>  public void upsert(int customerId, int somethingElse) { // some code which is prone to race conditions }",Java synchronized method around parameter value

How to use NDK-compiled JNI library in normal non-Android Java application?," I have a JNI library that was made to be used by Android app with NDK.I do not have sources, only compiled .so files for some archs.I want to call functions from this library in a simple console Java application on a 64-bit x86 linux PC.What I've done:I took the library from x86_64 folder and loaded it in my Java program using System.loadLibraryTried to launch the program and got UnsatisfiedLinkError with details liblog.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.So I took liblog.so for x86_64 arch from official NDK and loaded it too, then got a same error with libstdc++.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directoryDid the same thing for libstdc++.so library and got this /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so: invalid ELF header.Opened libc.so and it appeared to be just a text file... Replaced it with the proper libc.so fileFinally got UnsatisfiedLinkError for my library with undefined symbol: __stack_chk_guard comment. Looks like my library is strongly tightened with Android thingsWhat should I do to use this library in my normal program without anything Android-specific? <code> ",How to use NDK-compiled JNI library in a normal non-Android Java application?

"Classloader leak of invalid SSL certificate in SolrJ, HttpClient, JVM or my application because?"," I've analyzed a classloader leak the last few days in a large application and I've worked out the problem.My application uses SolrJ which will be initialilzed through a @Bean-Method: SolrJ (org.apache.solr:solr-solrj:5.4.1) uses the Apache HttpClient (org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.4.1). The HttpClient initializes the SSL context by using normal java classes like javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.In this way java loads the trustManager and analyzes all trusted certificates. If there is an error the certificate (an instance of sun.security.x509.X509CertImpl) is stored in a list and gets enriched by the thrown exception.This exception is swallowed and my application remains unaware.As far as I can see, the SSL Context is in the System / Root Classloader, my Application is in the dedicated WebappClassLoader and this is the problem because now there is an IOException inside of the SSL context which contains references in the stacktrace, backtrace and so on to classes in my application.But now I don't know where this came from. Is it the SolrJ client, the Apache HttpClient, Java itself (the JVM) or is it my application?I have made a small application to reproduce the problem which you can find here: https://github.com/CptS/solrj-classloader-leakThis also contains a Workaround (a shutdown hook which removes the references which leads to the classloader leak).If you disable the shutdown hook (e.g. by commenting it out) and start a clean Tomcat (see ""Environment to reproduce"" below) you can reproduce it by following this steps:deploy the war of the demo project (A)reload it (B)reload it again (C)Trigger GC (D)undeployTrigger GC (E)See that the metaspace gets not completly cleaned up (F)I've create a heap dump and the shortest path to GC looks like this:This was the same as in my large application.The mentioned Workaround (a little bit inspired by https://github.com/mjiderhamn/classloader-leak-prevention, but this unfortunately doesn't solve my problem) searches by using reflection for these unparseableExtensions and removes the Exception stored in the why field through this way: SSLContextImpl.DefaultSSLContext#defaultImpl -> SSLContextImpl#trustManager -> X509TrustManager#trustedCerts -> X509CertImpl#info -> X509CertInfo#extensions -> CertificateExtensions#unparseableExtensions -> UnparseableExtension#whyBy doing this i've got the stacktrace of the exception if it helps someone: My workaround solves the problem for now, but of course this is just a workaround.I want to know and maybe someone can answer one or more of my question:Is this a ""bug"" in SolrJ, HttpClient, Java or my application?If it is my application, what I am doing wrong? If it is not my application, is it a known problem? I can't find any information about this. (Where) should I create a bug ticket?Why is there a ""invalid"" certificate? (BTW: Maybe the leak would also be solve if I remove this certificate from the trust store... I haven't tested but I think a invalid or damaged certificate should never lead to a classloader leak...)Has anyone some more information on this? I can't belive that I'm the only one who detect this behaviour (except it is my appication... see my question 2).At last but not least, my Environment to reproduce:Tomcat Version: Apache Tomcat/8.0.14

I read everywhere that Android doesn't allow users to write to external SD card, by SD card I mean the external and mountable SD card and not the external storage, but file manager applications manage to write to External SD on all Android versions. What is the better way to grant read/write access to external SD card on different API levels (Pre-KitKat, KitKat, Lollipop+)?Update 1I tried Method 1 from Doomknight's answer, with no avail: As you can see I'm checking for permissions at runtime before attempting to write on SD: But I get an access error, tried on two different devices: HTC10 and Shield K1. <code>  HashSet<String> extDirs = getStorageDirectories();for(String dir: extDirs) { Log.e(""SD"",dir); File f = new File(new File(dir),""TEST.TXT""); try { if(ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this,Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)==PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) { f.createNewFile(); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }} 10-22 14:52:57.329 30280-30280/?

Does Java's try-with-resources catches errors or just exceptions?," I have some junit tests which create some resources which should also be closed.One way to implement this logic is using the @Before and @After approach.What I did was to encapsulate the creation in some utility class to be reused.

Web page changes based upon automation," I have written a small script that takes the default IP address for Epson printers we receive at my company and changes them automatically according to the requirement. This is done using Selenium HtmlUnitDriver.The script gets the page, inserts the new IP, and than submits it.

When the reset element is clicked, the initial URL of http://192.168.192.168/ctcpip.htm is effectively nonexistent, since we have changed it to 192.169.192.169.

Disable Font Cache," When I call PDField.setValue to set the value for a form field, I get the following stacktrace: I am running PDFBox 2.0.4 which is the newest version. My webserver most likely does not have access to write to .pdfbox.cache in the default location (which seems to be the JVM property user.home). Is there any way to disable the disk caching or change the location of the cache file?I did notice that I can set a JVM wide system property called pdfbox.fontcache, but my webapp shares a jvm with other applications so this isn't an optimal solution. I also tried using that solution and setting the pdfbox.fontcache to /tmp, but it didn't actually create a file (although it now only throws the stacktrace once per boot).I looked into the code in the FileSystemFontProvider and the problematic code seems to be in the saveDiskCache method. In that method, it first tries to write the file, but a FileNotFoundException is thrown instead of a SecurityException. FileNotFoundException inherits from IOException. <code>  FileSystemFontProvider.saveDiskCache(349) | Could not write to font cachejava.io.FileNotFoundException: /.pdfbox.cache (Permission denied)at java.io.FileOutputStream.open(Native Method)at java.io.FileOutputStream.<init>(FileOutputStream.java:194)at java.io.FileOutputStream.<init>(FileOutputStream.java:145)at java.io.FileWriter.<init>(FileWriter.java:73)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.FileSystemFontProvider.saveDiskCache(FileSystemFontProvider.java:290)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.FileSystemFontProvider.<init>(FileSystemFontProvider.java:226)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.FontMapperImpl$DefaultFontProvider.<clinit>(FontMapperImpl.java:130)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.FontMapperImpl.getProvider(FontMapperImpl.java:149)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.FontMapperImpl.findFont(FontMapperImpl.java:413)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.FontMapperImpl.findFontBoxFont(FontMapperImpl.java:376)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.FontMapperImpl.getFontBoxFont(FontMapperImpl.java:350)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDType1Font.<init>(PDType1Font.java:145)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDType1Font.<clinit>(PDType1Font.java:79)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDFontFactory.createFont(PDFontFactory.java:62)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDResources.getFont(PDResources.java:143)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDDefaultAppearanceString.processSetFont(PDDefaultAppearanceString.java:164)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDDefaultAppearanceString.processOperator(PDDefaultAppearanceString.java:131)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDDefaultAppearanceString.processAppearanceStringOperators(PDDefaultAppearanceString.java:107)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDDefaultAppearanceString.<init>(PDDefaultAppearanceString.java:85)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDVariableText.getDefaultAppearanceString(PDVariableText.java:93)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.AppearanceGeneratorHelper.<init>(AppearanceGeneratorHelper.java:94)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDTextField.constructAppearances(PDTextField.java:262)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDTerminalField.applyChange(PDTerminalField.java:228)at org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.interactive.form.PDTextField.setValue(PDTextField.java:218) File file = getDiskCacheFile();try{ writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file));}catch (SecurityException e){ return;}",PDFBox: Disable Font Cache or change its location

Why is parellel stream slower?," I was playing around with infinite streams and made this program for benchmarking. Basically the bigger the number you provide, the faster it will finish. However, I was amazed to find that using a parellel stream resulted in exponentially worse performance compared to a sequential stream. Intuitively, one would expect an infinite stream of random numbers to be generated and evaluated much faster in a multi-threaded environment, but this appears not to be the case. Why is this? <code>  final int target = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); if (target <= 0) { System.err.println(""Target must be between 1 and 2147483647""); return; } final long startTime, endTime; startTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); System.out.println( IntStream.generate(() -> new Double(Math.random()*2147483647).intValue()) //.parallel() .filter(i -> i <= target) .findFirst() .getAsInt() ); endTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); System.out.println(""Execution time: ""+(endTime-startTime)+"" ms"");",Why is parallel stream slower?

Java 8 - Differences between Arrays.stream() and Stream.of()," I have a list of Strings: Then to convert everything in a list like: ""a1"",""a2"",""b1"",""b2"" wrote this: But I had an error: ""Type mismatch: cannot convert from List<Serializable> to List<String>"".

First flatMap returns a List<Serializable> second returns a List<String>.But both Stream.of() and Arrays.stream() returns a <T> Stream<T> (Eclipse suggests that they both returns a Stream<String>).And again, Stream.of() internally use (and returns the output of) Arrays.stream().

Which data structure to use when storing multiple entities with multiple query criteria?," There is a storage unit, with has a capacity for N items. Initially this unit is empty.The space is arranged in a linear manner, i.e. one beside the other in a line. Each storage space has a number, increasing till N.When someone drops their package, it is assigned the first available space. The packages could also be picked up, in this case the space becomes vacant.Example: If the total capacity was 4. and 1 and 2 are full the third person to come in will be assigned the space 3. If 1, 2 and 3 were full and the 2nd space becomes vacant, the next person to come will be assigned the space 2.The packages they drop have 2 unique properties, assigned for immediate identification. First they are color coded based on their content and second they are assigned a unique identification number(UIN).What we want is to query the system:When the input is color, show all the UIN associated with this color.When the input is color, show all the numbers where these packages are placed(storage space number).Show where an item with a given UIN is placed, i.e. storage space number.I would like to know how which Data Structures to use for this case, so that the system works as efficiently as possible?And I am not given which of these operations os most frequent, which means I will have to optimise for all the cases.Please take a note, even though the query process is not directly asking for storage space number, but when an item is removed from the store it is removed by querying from the storage space number. <code> ",Which data structures to use when storing multiple entities with multiple query criteria?
Android Volley Request Working In Simulator But Not On Device," I am making a simple Android Wear app to control my thermostats, and I'm sending POST requests with Volley to control them. Everything works great in the Android Wear simulator (the request works), but, while the app does load on my Moto 360, the volley request gets called but invariably times out.Why could my volley request be failing on my watch but working on the simulator? Other apps' requests succeed on my watch (for example, the built-in weather app can load up weather data in about 3 seconds). And, the weirdest part: I had the app working (successfully making volley requests) on my watch, and, about a day after I installed it to my watch from Android Studio, it suddenly stopped loading data for no apparent reason.What I've tried so far:I have requested the Internet permission in my manifest.xml.I have increased the timeout to 30 seconds (see my code below), which didn't change anything.I have tried tethering my computer and the simulator to my phone's connection via Bluetooth (to replicate the Bluetooth connection my physical watch has to my phone), and the simulator made the request successfully still (albeit with a two-second delay), ruling out the possibility of Bluetooth being too slow.I made sure the API level is low enough for my Marshmallow-running watch (my watch and the app are both API level 23).I tried doing a quick test request to Google before the request to the company's servers with my thermostat data, and while the Google request returns the site's HTML code in the simulator, it times out on my watch (thirty seconds after the request is initiated).I tried putting some dummy data into the recycler view data should be loaded into, and the dummy data indeed showed up, ruling out that the recycler view is broken.I deleted the app from my watch and reinstalled it, and deleted the companion from my phone, reinstalled it, and deleted it again, all to no avail.A lengthy chat with Google Support did not produce anything meaningful.Here's my code (from my main view's adapter): Which is called from the onCreate() method in my Main Activity with this code: If you'd like to view the logs created by running this in the simulator and on the watch, they're on Google Drive here.Edit 1: A reboot of my watch fixes the issue temporarily and allows the watch to make HTTP Requests again, but it breaks again once the watch disconnects from Bluetooth, connects to WiFi, disconnects from WiFi, and reconnects to Bluetooth (so it breaks every time I go across my apartment without my phone and then return).Edit 2: I switched the volley requests all over to HTTPURLConnection Requests in an Async thread, and the same issues occur as with volley.tl;dr: My app's Volley requests are working in the simulator but not on my Android Wear watch anymore (though Play Store-downloaded apps' similar requests work), how can I get a volley request to work again on my app on the watch? <code>  public void refreshThermostatsRecyclerView(RequestQueue queue) { String url = ""https://mobile.skyport.io:9090/login""; // login call to the thermostats server Skyport Log.w(""myApp"", ""Starting /login call to Skyport""); // this gets called on simulator and watch // Request a string response from the provided URL.

Point to point messaging in chat messenger?," After googling how message is sent/received in chat messenger like whatsapp, i came across they use queues based messaging system. I am just tryingto figure out what can be high level design of this featureHLD per mine understanding :-Say Friend 1 and Friend 2 are online . Friend 1 has established HTTP web connection to web server 1 and Friend 2 has established HTTP web connection to web server 2. Friend 1 send the message to Friend 2.Now as soon as message comes to web server 1, i need to convey the message to web server 2 so that message can be pushed back to friend 2 through already established web connection.I believe distributed custom java queues can be used here to propagate the message from one server to another. As soon as message comes to one server , it will push it to distributed queue(distribute queue because of load balancing and high availability) with message content, fromUserId, toUserId. There will be listener on queue which will see destination userId of just poppedIn message and find on which webserver destination userId is active . If user is active pop out the message and push it to client otherwise store it in db so that it can be pulledonce once gets online. To see which user is active on which server, there we can maintain the treemap with userId as key and value as serverName for efficient look upProbably actual design must be more complex/scalable than above brief . Would like to know if this is the right direction for scalable chat messenger?Also i believe we need to have multiple distributed queues instead of one for such a scalable application. But if we have multiple distributed queues how system will ensure the FIFO message delivery across distributed queues ? <code> ",Point to point messaging in scalabale application?

How deep volatile publication guaratees?," As is known guarant that if we have some object reference and this reference has final field - we will see all reachable fields from final field(at least when constructor was finished)example 1: As I undertand at this case we have guarantee that bar() method always output object because:1. I listed full code of class Foo and map is final;2. If some thread will see reference of Foo and this reference != null, then we have guarantees that reachable from final map reference value will be actual.also I think that Example 2: here we have same gurantees about bar() method but bar2 can throw NullPointerException despite nonFinalMap assignment occurs before map assignment.I want to know how about volatile: Example 3: As I understand bar() method cannot throw NullPoinerException but it can print null; (I am fully not sure about this aspect)Example 4: I think here we have same gurantees about bar() method also bar2() cannot throw NullPointerException because nonVolatileMap assignment written higher volatile map assignment but it can output nullAdded after Elliott Frisch commentPublication through race example: Please proove or correct my comments to code snippets. <code>  class Foo{ private final Map map; Foo(){ map = new HashMap(); map.put(1,""object""); } public void bar(){ System.out.println(map.get(1)); }} class Foo { private final Map map; private Map nonFinalMap; Foo() { nonFinalMap = new HashMap(); nonFinalMap.put(2, ""ololo""); map = new HashMap(); map.put(1, ""object""); } public void bar() { System.out.println(map.get(1)); } public void bar2() { System.out.println(nonFinalMap.get(2)); }} class Foo{ private volatile Map map; Foo(){ map = new HashMap(); map.put(1,""object""); } public void bar(){ System.out.println(map.get(1)); } } class Foo { private volatile Map map; private Map nonVolatileMap; Foo() { nonVolatileMap= new HashMap(); nonVolatileMap.put(2, ""ololo""); map = new HashMap(); map.put(1, ""object""); } public void bar() { System.out.println(map.get(1)); } public void bar2() { System.out.println(nonFinalMap.get(2)); }} public class Main { private static Foo foo; public static void main(String[] args) { new Thread(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { foo = new Foo(); } }).start(); new Thread(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { while (foo == null) ; // empty loop foo.bar(); } }).start(); }}",How deep volatile publication guarantees?

It stopped building the ""spurious"" 2.2.1 directory.Can someone tell me how Gradle decides which version of itself it is using?

How to configure Sprint TestRestTemplate," I have a REST (spring-hateoas) server that I'd like to test with a JUnit test. Therefore I am using an autoinjected TestRestTemplate.But how do I now add some more configuration to this pre configured TestRestTemplate? I need to configure the rootURI and add interceptors.Thisi s my JUnit Test class: The documentation sais that a static @TestConfiguration class can be used. But inside that static class I cannot access localServerPort or basePath: My most important question: Why doesn't TestRestTemplate take spring.data.rest.base-path from application.properties into account in the first place? Isn't the idea of beeing complete preconfigured, the whole use case of this wrapper class?The doc sais If you are using the @SpringBootTest annotation, a TestRestTemplate is automatically available and can be @Autowired into you test. If you need customizations (for example to adding additional message converters) use a RestTemplateBuilder @Bean.How does that look like in a complete Java code example? <code>  @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)@ActiveProfiles(""test"")@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) public class RestEndpointTests { private Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass()); @LocalServerPort int localServerPort; @Value(value = ""${spring.data.rest.base-path}"") // nice trick to get basePath from application.properties String basePath; @Autowired TestRestTemplate client; // how to configure client?

Why LogWriter race condition can lead to producer blocking ?(concurrency in practice)," First of all to prevent mark question as duplicate by guys who don't like read to the end I have read Producer-Consumer Logging service with Unreliable way to shutdown question. But it is not fully answer the question and answer contradicts the book text.In book provided following code: Now we should to understand how to stop this process. We should stop logging but should not skip already commited messages.Author researches approach: and comment it like this: Another approach to shutting down LogWriter would be to set a shutdown requested flag to prevent further messages from being submitted, as shown in Listing 7.14. The con- sumer could then drain the queue upon being notified that shutdown has been requested, writing out any pending messages and unblocking any producers blocked in log . However, this approach has race conditions that make it unreliable. The implementation of log is a check-then-act sequence: producers could observe that the service has not yet been shut down but still queue messages after the shutdown, again with the risk that the producer might get blocked in log and never become unblocked. There are tricks that reduce the likelihood of this (like having the consumer wait several seconds before declaring the queue drained), but these do not change the fundamental problem, merely the likelihood that it will cause a fail- ure.The phrase build enough hard for me.I understand that is not atomic and message can be added to the queue after shutdowning. Yes, it is not very accurate but I don't see problem. queue just will be drain and when queue will be empty we can stop LoggerThread.

JPA AttributeConverter make hibernate generate update statements on whole table in transaction," All code in this post can be found here:https://github.com/cuipengfei/gs-accessing-data-jpa/tree/master/completeYou can run this test to reproduce the problem:https://github.com/cuipengfei/gs-accessing-data-jpa/blob/master/complete/src/test/java/hello/T1ServiceTest.javaI have a domain model: It has a field typed as ZonedDateTime, so I have a converter to convert it to sql time stamp: When I try to create a lot of T1s in a transaction like this: There will be update statements generated by hibernate for the whole t1 table.Here is the log for the first a few rounds of the for loop: As you can see in the log, more and more update statements will be generated by hibernate.It looks like the number of update statements is always same as how many rows of T1 waiting to be committed.Now if I remove the converter, this problem goes away.I can use hibernate-java8 lib instead of this converter to achieve the same effect, but why does this happen?Why does JPA AttributeConverter make hibernate generate update statements on whole table in transaction? <code>  @Entity@Table(name = ""t1"", schema = ""test"")public class T1 extends BaseEntity { @Column(nullable = false) private UUID someField; @Column() private ZonedDateTime date; public T1(UUID someField, ZonedDateTime date) { this.someField = someField; this.date = date; }} @Converter(autoApply = true)public class ZonedDateTimeAttributeConverter implements AttributeConverter<ZonedDateTime, Timestamp> { @Override public Timestamp convertToDatabaseColumn(ZonedDateTime entityValue) { return (entityValue == null) ? null : valueOf(entityValue.withZoneSameInstant(of(""UTC"")).toLocalDateTime()); } @Override public ZonedDateTime convertToEntityAttribute(Timestamp databaseValue) { return (databaseValue == null) ? null : databaseValue.toLocalDateTime().atZone( of(""UTC"")); }} @Servicepublic class T1Service { private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(T1Service.class); @Autowired T1Repository t1Repository; @Transactional public void insertMany() { for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { log.info(""!!!

Can I dispatch messages using an algorithm instead of round robin using RabbitMQ?," I'm using RabbitMQ's round robin feature to dispatch messages between multiple consumers but having only one of them receive the actual message at a time.My problem is that my messages represent tasks and I would like to have local sessions (state) on my consumers. I know beforehand which messages belong to which session but I don't know what is the best way (or is there a way?) to make RabbitMQ dispatch to consumers using an algorithm I specify.I don't want to write my own orchestration service because it will become a bottleneck and I don't want my producers to know which consumer will take their messages because I'll lose the decoupling I get using Rabbit.Is there a way to make RabbitMQ dispatch my messages to consumers based on a pre-defined algorithm/rule instead of round robin?Clarification: I use several microservices written in different languages and each service has its own job. I communicate between them using protobuf messages. I give each new message a UUID. If a consumer receives a message it can create a response message from it (this might not be the correct terminology since the producers and consumers are decoupled and they don't know about each other) and this UUID is copied to the new message. This forms a data transformation pipeline and this ""process"" is identified by the UUID (the processId). My problem is that it is possible that I have multiple worker consumers and I need a worker to stick to an UUID if it has seen it before. I have this need because there might be local state for each processAfter the process is finished I want to clean up the local stateA microservice might receive multiple messages for the same process and I need to differentiate which message belongs to which process Since RabbitMQ distributes tasks between workers using round robin I can't force my processes to stick to a worker. I have several caveats:The producers are decoupled from the consumers so direct messaging is not an optionThe number of workers is not constant (there is a load balancer which might start new instances of a worker)If there is a workaround which does not involve changing the round robin algorithm and does not break my constraints it is also OK! <code> ",Can I dispatch messages with a custom algorithm instead of round robin using RabbitMQ?

Get a reference to currenly active dataSource in Spring Boot," I want to implement db data init via DataSourceInitializer.I have these as methods just below my Spring Boot main method, but it seems that it doesn't get executed at all (I tried with intentional removal of characters just to trigger an error which would confirm the execution. Nothing happened.): UPDATE: This question was aimed at getting a reference to the dataSource in use. This question explains how to init the data in a very simple way:DataSourceInitializer is not working on Spring boot 1.2 <code>  @ConfigurationProperties(prefix=""spring.datasource"")@Beanpublic DataSource getDataSource() { // i was hoping this was going to pull my current datasource, as // defined in application.properties return DataSourceBuilder .create() .build();}@Beanpublic DataSourceInitializer dataSourceInitializer() { ResourceDatabasePopulator resourceDatabasePopulator = new ResourceDatabasePopulator(); resourceDatabasePopulator.addScript(new ClassPathResource(""/data/init/initData.sql"")); DataSourceInitializer dataSourceInitializer = new DataSourceInitializer(); // the call to the above method dataSourceInitializer.setDataSource(getDataSource()); dataSourceInitializer.setDatabasePopulator(resourceDatabasePopulator); return dataSourceInitializer;}",Get a reference to currently active dataSource in Spring Boot
Why in Java we can use the String class as if it were a primitive?," In Java we usually do: because the new keyword returns an address. But why can we do this?: as if String were a primitive? I asked this to my teacher and he replied that it is because what is in quotes is equivalent to an address, but he is not sure. Can you confirm? Is ""Hello"" stored in an instance variable of the class String? <code>  Class myObject = new Class(); String myString = ""Hello"";","In Java, why can we use the String class as if it were a primitive?"
Java Heap Allocation is in multiples of 4MB on 64 bit 2MB on 32 bit," I have noticed that Java heap allocation is in the multiples of 2 MB. For example I started the JVM with -Xmx values as 1021m, 1022m both JVMs started with the heap size of 1022m. Similarly heap sizes 1023m,1024m started with 1024m.The output is below: In both the cases it shows the MaxHeapSize as 1071644672 bytes which is 1022mb. In both the cases it shows the MaxHeapSize as 1073741824 bytes which is 1024mb.This behavior is similar for Xms.Question 1: Why are heap sizes being changed from the specified values to next multiple of 2?Question 2: Why Java does not even warn us when the JVM has actually started with a value different than the one specifiedQuestion 3: Is there a flag or some way to force JVM to create a Heap of 1021mb?Question 4: In hypothetical situation say I have 1023mb of free memory available on my machine and I try to create an JVM with 1023mb of heap. By the above behavior it actually tries to start with 1024mb which is not available. Will the JVM creation fail? <code>  C:\Users\myuser>java -Xmx1021m -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | findstr ""MaxHeapSize"" uintx MaxHeapSize := 1071644672 {product}java version ""1.8.0_121""Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)C:\Users\myuser>java -Xmx1022m -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | findstr ""MaxHeapSize"" uintx MaxHeapSize := 1071644672 {product}java version ""1.8.0_121""Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode) C:\Users\myuser>java -Xmx1023m -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | findstr ""MaxHeapSize"" uintx MaxHeapSize := 1073741824 {product}java version ""1.8.0_121""Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)C:\Users\myuser>java -Xmx1024m -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | findstr ""MaxHeapSize"" uintx MaxHeapSize := 1073741824 {product}java version ""1.8.0_121""Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)",Java Heap Allocation is in multiples of 2MB
"Tomcat server deployment error, disconnection on attept to connect LocalHost"," I can't understand what happened. There was no problem 2 days ago and now I can't deploy my applications. Any of it.

There is nothing useful in the logs (no warnings/errors). This issue is in EVERY of my JEE applications.As I said a tried many solutions from here EXCEPT the one with changing the value of %JAVA_OPTS% env var because I've got no 'setenv.bat' file anywhere in Tomcat directory and in Catalina.bat this variable seems to be set properly.I'm quite new to this kind of technology and I am a little afraid to start tweaking around in stuff I don't know.

Why is Comparator a functional interface though it has more than one abstract methods in Java 8?," In Java 8, the @FunctionalInterface annotation is introduced to denote any interface that has exactly one abstract method as a functional interface. One of the reason for its introduction is to indicate the user (programmer), that lambda expression can be used in context of a functional interface. The Comparator interface is annotated with @FunctionalInterface. But, two methods are abstract. and In the docs of FunctionalInterface, it is clearly mentioned as Conceptually, a functional interface has exactly one abstract method.Isn't the equals method not considered as abstract here?  <code>  int compare(T o1, T o2); boolean equals(Object obj);",How can Comparator be a Functional Interface when it has two abstract methods?

Cannot resolve GoogleApiClient connection failure," I'm trying to use the Google Games turn based Api for my Android game. The code I use to connect my GoogleApiClient comes from Google's Api samples or documentation.Inside of my implementation of onConnectionFailed I have tried two separate approaches: The first approach above comes from the TBMP Skeleton sample. This results in a dialog being created with the messageFailed to sign in. Please check your network connection and try again.and the connection is never made. In the second approach it ends up calling startResolutionForResult which passes RESULT_SIGN_IN_FAILED to onActivityResult. From the documentationResult code sent back to the calling Activity when signing in fails.The attempt to sign in to the Games service failed. For example, this might happen if the network is flaky, or the user's account has been disabled, or consent could not be obtained.This puzzles me since I have no problems getting the sign in flow to work in a sample. However, in my game I am never prompted to select a Google account before the sign in fails.For the record I've tried all the steps here https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/troubleshooting and it still fails.How can I resolve this error in order to sign in? <code>  if (signInClicked || autoStartSignInFlow) { autoStartSignInFlow = false; signInClicked = false; resolvingConnectionFailure = true; // Attempt to resolve the connection failure using BaseGameUtils. // The R.string.signin_other_error value should reference a generic // error string in your strings.xml file, such as ""There was // an issue with sign-in, please try again later."" if (!BaseGameUtils.resolveConnectionFailure(this, apiClient, connectionResult, RC_SIGN_IN, R.string.signin_other_error)) { resolvingConnectionFailure = false; } } if (connectionResult.hasResolution()) { // https://developers.google.com/android/guides/api-client under 'Handle connection // failures'.

Spring command line add files to classpath," I am using Netbeans 8.2 to develop Spring applications. This specific app with which I am having trouble is a Spring Boot 1.5.3 app. I have a spring xml file and an application.properties that I keep in /config under the root project directory. I am passing the spring xml file to my project via the @ImportResource annotation and a value property like @ImportResource(value=""${config.xmlfile}"").When I click the 'Run Project' button in Netbeans my Spring app starts up and it correctly finds the application.properties file in my /config folder. However, any classpath references to other files in that folder are lost. For example, setting the config.xml file to classpath:config/file.xml or classpath:file.xml both fail to find the file but file:config/file.xml works.Similarly, when running from the command line I have the following as my structure: I am using the spring-boot-maven-plugin to make the jar as follows: and my app-run.sh script executes the following: where /bin/java represents the location where I have java installed. The classpath set in -cp does not seem to be working here. Similarly to when running through the IDE, setting the config.xml file to classpath:config/file.xml or classpath:file.xml both fail to find the file but file:../config/file.xml works.I would like to be able to set the classpath in both the IDE and from command line so that I can access files in Spring using classpath reference to make things easier.

It's just that with Java 9's modules, developers no longer need the class path.So now my question is: what is the proper Java 9 way to do the tasks listed above? How do you dynamically load e.g. an image (short of fiddling with relative paths)?Even more interestingly, how would one check if a class is available and make a decision dynamically (e.g. check if Jackson is available and, if so, use it for JSON serialization and if not use something else)?The article also mentions Spring Boot already supporting Java 9, and Spring Boot definitely does a lot of dynamic loading.

HashMap vs array performance difference," To solve Dynamic programming problem I used two approaches to store table entries, one using multi dimension array ex:tb[m][n][p][q] and other using hashmap and using indexes of 1st approach to make string to be used as key as in ""m,n,p,q"". But on one input first approach completes in 2 minutes while other takes more than 3 minutes. If access time of both hashmap and array is asymptotically equal than why so big difference in performance ?  <code> ",HashMap vs array performance difference in following approach
Selenium - Other way to basic authenticate than via url," In my Selenium-Test (with chromedriver-2.24) I'm trying to access my webpage via basic authentication with the following statement: But Google Chrome gives me the following warning in the console: [Deprecation] Subresource requests whose URLs contain embedded credentials (e.g. https://user:pass@host/) are blocked.

Understanding deeply spliterator characteristics in java 8 and java 9," In order to try to deeply understand java streams and spliterators, I have some subtle questions about spliterator characteristics:Q1: Stream.empty() vs Stream.of() (Stream.of() without args)Stream.empty(): SUBSIZED, SIZEDStream.of(): SUBSIZED, IMMUTABLE, SIZED, ORDEREDWhy Stream.empty() doesn't have the same characteristics of Stream.of()? Note that it has impacts when using in conjunction with Stream.concat() (specially not having ORDERED). I would say that Stream.empty() should have not just IMMUTABLE and ORDERED but also DISTINCT and NONNULL. Also it make sense Stream.of() with only one argument having DISTICT.Q2: LongStream.of() not having NONNULLJust noticed that NONNULL is not available in LongStream.of.Isn't NONNULL a main characteristics of all LongStreams, IntStreams and DoubleStreams?Q3: LongStream.range(,) vs LongStream.range(,).boxed()LongRange.range(,): SUBSIZED, IMMUTABLE, NONNULL, SIZED, ORDERED, SORTED, DISTINCTLongStream.range(,).boxed(): SUBSIZED, SIZED, ORDEREDWhy .boxed() loses all these characteristics? It shouldn't lose any.I understand that .mapToObj() can lose the NONNULL, IMMUTABLE and DISTICT, but .boxed()... doesn't make sense.Q4: .peek() loses IMMUTABLE and NONNULLLongStream.of(1): SUBSIZED, IMMUTABLE, NONNULL, SIZED, ...LongStream.of(1).peek(): SUBSIZED, SIZED, ...Why .peek() loses these characteristics? .peek shouldn't really lose any.Q5: .skip(), .limit() loses SUBSIZED, IMMUTABLE, NONNULL, SIZEDJust notice that these operations loses SUBSIZED, IMMUTABLE, NONNULL, SIZED. Why? If the size is available, then it's easy to calculate the final size as well.Q6: .filter() loses IMMUTABLE, NONNULLJust notice that this operations loses as well SUBSIZED, IMMUTABLE, NONNULL, SIZED. It make sense to lose SUBSIZED and SIZED, but the others two doesn't make sense. Why?I will appreciate if someone that understands deeply the spliterator could bring some clarity. Thanks. <code> ",Understanding deeply spliterator characteristics

Jboss EAP 7 - How to exclude implicit modules from deployment (javax.jms)," I didn't think I would end up here but after a lot of Google and StackOverflow searches here I'm. This is my exact problem except that I can't afford to make code changes.The WAR I'm trying to deploy includes a JMS library (i.e. javax.jms, which I cannot exclude form the WAR.) which is already loaded by Jboss EAP 7 by default. The path to jar is something like this jboss/modules/system/layers/base/javax/jms/api/ain/jboss-jms-api_2.0_spec-1.0.0.Final-redhat-1.jar. Because of this two different versions of the same classes loading I'm getting ClassCastException. So, I want Jboss to NOT load javax.jms so that my application can use the JAR included with the WAR.So, I was wondering if there was any way to exclude the module globally (for all WAR deployments).Excluding it per deployment would work too. And I do realize it can be acheivd using jboss-deployment-structure.xml but I can't get it to work.Here is what I tried: and I placed the file in WEB-INF directory. It didn't work.

What is allocated under `Other` memory category in Android Profiler and MemoryInfo?," Android Studio Memory Profiler reports allocations in Others category.According to https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/memory-profiler.html: Other: Memory used by your app that the system isn't sure how to categorize.If we dig deeper, similar memory footprint information can be retrieved at runtime using https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug.MemoryInfo.html#getMemoryStat(java.lang.String)It looks like Others in Android Studio Memory Profiler corresponds to summary.private-other in Debug.MemoryInfo class. That parameter is reported as: Which kind of memory allocations end up in that category? It is obviously not Java, Native, Code, Stack and Graphics. If my app (with enormously large codebase so I can't really pin point a certain code that causes it) consumes a lot of Other memory, is there a certain source/pattern that leads to such consumption?Edit 1I was able to partially answer the first part my own question: Which kind of memory allocations end up in that category? It is obviously not Java, Native, Code, Stack and Graphics.RAM info can also be retrieved using adb shell dumpsys meminfo <your proc name> and typically looks like:Experimentally, I can see that Unknown is most likely included into Private Other. Which raises the next question: what is Unknown? According to https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/dumpsys.html#meminfo: Any RAM pages that the system could not classify into one of the other more specific items. Currently, this contains mostly native allocations, which cannot be identified by the tool when collecting this data due to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Like the Dalvik heap, the Pss Total for Unknown takes into account sharing with Zygote, and Private Dirty is unknown RAM dedicated to only your app.It looks like it's still native allocations. Identifiable Native allocations end up in Native category, however, Native allocations whose data is no longer identifiable due to ASLR seem to end up in Unknown.The main question however still holds: If my app (with enormously large codebase so I can't really pin point a certain code that causes it) consumes a lot of Other memory, is there a certain source/pattern that leads to such consumption? I'm looking for answers such as hanging threads, open cursors, webviews and etc. <code>  public int getSummaryPrivateOther() { return getTotalPrivateClean() + getTotalPrivateDirty() - getSummaryJavaHeap() - getSummaryNativeHeap() - getSummaryCode() - getSummaryStack() - getSummaryGraphics(); }",`Unknown` (`Other`) memory leak in Android?
"Java 8 -Two interfaces contain same 'name' default method but different method signature, how to override?"," I understand that if a class implements multiple interfaces containing default methods of same name, then we need to override that method in the child class so as to explicitly define what my method will do.Problem is, see the below code : Now interface A and B both have a default method with name 'print' but I want to override the print method of interface B - the one that returns a string and leave A's print as is. But this code doesn't compile giving this : Clearly compiler is trying to override A's print method, and I have no idea why ! <code>  interface A { default void print() { System.out.println("" In interface A ""); }}interface B { default String print() { return ""In interface B""; }}public class C implements A, B { @Override public String print() { return ""In class C""; } public static void main(String arg[]) { // Other funny things }} Overrides A.printThe return type is incompatible with A.print()","Java 8 -Two interfaces contain default methods with the same method signature but different return types, how to override?"
Usage of Jackson @JsonProperty annotation in kotlin," kotlin 1.2.10jackson-module-kotlin:2.9.0I have the following data class in kotlin: When I try to deserialize this data class I get the following: As you can see, the last two options were deserialized incorrectly.This issue could be solved by adding directly annotation to getter @get:JsonProperty. However, according to jackson docs @JsonProperty should be assigned to getters/setters/fieldsSo, I want to ask is there a reliable way to annotate property for jackson in kotlin to have correct serialization/deserialization (moreover all my data classes are autogenerated, so it would be hard to create some two/three lines annotations, separately for getter and setter)Otherwise, could this issue be resolved by some jackson settings?According to answers below, the following works for me <code>  data class CurrencyInfo( @JsonProperty(""currency_info"") var currencyInfo: CurrencyInfoItem?)@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)data class CurrencyInfoItem( @JsonProperty(""iso_4217"") var iso4217: String?, @JsonProperty(""name"") var name: String?, @JsonProperty(""name_major"") var nameMajor: String?, @JsonProperty(""name_minor"") var nameMinor: String?, @JsonProperty(""i_ma_currency"") var iMaCurrency: Int?, @JsonProperty(""i_merchant_account"") var iMerchantAccount: Int?, @JsonProperty(""i_x_rate_source"") var iXRateSource: Int?, @JsonProperty(""base_units"") var baseUnits: Double?, @JsonProperty(""min_allowed_payment"") var minAllowedPayment: Int?, @JsonProperty(""decimal_digits"") var decimalDigits: Int?, @JsonProperty(""is_used"") var isUsed: Boolean?) {""currency_info"":{""iso_4217"":""CAD"",""name"":""Canadian Dollar"",""imerchantAccount"":0,""ixrateSource"":2}} private val mapper = ObjectMapper().registerKotlinModule().setVisibility(PropertyAccessor.FIELD, JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.ANY).setVisibility(PropertyAccessor.CREATOR, JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.NONE).setVisibility(PropertyAccessor.GETTER, JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.NONE).setVisibility(PropertyAccessor.SETTER, JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.NONE).setVisibility(PropertyAccessor.IS_GETTER, JsonAutoDetect.Visibility.NONE)",Usage of Jackson @JsonProperty annotation for kotlin data classes

Shall I use pojo vs JsonObject for rest calls," Recently I have stumbled upon a situation where my new team is heavily using JsonObject for doing rest data interchange. Their view is while using pojo we are binding tightly with the rest service, while jsonObject gives freedom. Also it saves from unnecessary data serialisation at the same time reducing number of classes heavily.I have some points to encounter them as:Pojo gives more meaning to data and we are holding data with correct data type.If we need only 2 fields of 10 fields of json, we can deserialize to 2 fields class with @JsonIgnoreI don't know exactly on the cost of deserialisation, but somehow I have a feeling it shouldn't be much difference.Can someone help me understand which perspective is way to go ? Please provide some pros and cons of using POJO and JSONObject.Thanks <code> ",Shall I use POJO or JSONObject for REST calls

Android room migration using existing boolean column types," What i found out so far All the @entity annotated classes are processed during compiletime and an Implementation for Database class is generated. Then before accessing the db, validateMigration method of this generated class is called. This validateMigration method verifies with the existing db schema via raw queryPRAGMA table_info mytable name (see L208 of android.arch.persistence.room.util.TableInfo.java)Now the problem My sqlite3 db has some columns with column type as BOOLEAN. (which slqite internally handles to int). Now when i create room entities say The room's create table query will beCreate Table someEntity ( myValue INTEGER)Where as when we query the existing db with PRAGMA table_info someEntity we get1|myValue|BOOLEAN|0||0As explained above room verifies the ( sqlite to room ) migration by comparing field name, column type etc. And since the column types dont match (BOOLEAN and INTEGER) it throws an error saying migration failed.Can anyone suggest a workaround to this ? Can we make room create BOOLEAN column type in sqlite ? (Also afaik we can't change/alter column types of existing tables.)PS: I also see a similar issue with VARCHAR - Using an existing VARCHAR column with Room <code>  public someEntity { @columnInfo(name=""someName"") public Boolean myValue;}",room migration using existing boolean column types
is there any runtime benefit of using lambda expression in java?," I am reading couple of blogs and answers as well on lambda expression provided in Java 8. I am not able to figure out, is there any run-time benefit of unit lambda expression or not? I have copied following text from different sources which are too much confusing to me. One answer is saying - ""lambdas do NOT create a new scope, they share the same scope as the enclosing block/environment""In the one blog - ""There are no runtime benefits of using lambda expressions, so I will use it cautiously because I dont mind writing few extra lines of code.""From one other blog - ""one more benefit lambda expressions Sequential and Parallel Execution Support by passing behavior in methods""So there is lots off confusion for me. Please help me to clear this so I can avoid keeping wrong approach in mind before digging more in to this stuff.I have run following code and I can say the lambda expression in the following code is just replacement for the anonymous inner class and its running on main thread.

Why get method of HashMap has FOR loop," I am looking at the source code for HashMap in Java 7, and I see that the put method will check if any entry is already present and if it is present then it will replace the old value with the new value. So, basically it means that there would always be only one entry for the given key, I have seen this by debugging as well, but if I am wrong then please correct me.Now, since there is only one entry for a given key, why does the get method have a FOR loop, since it could have simply returned the value directly? I feel the above loop is unnecessary. Please help me understand if I am wrong. <code>  for (Entry<K,V> e = table[i]; e != null; e = e.next) { Object k; if (e.hash == hash && ((k = e.key) == key || key.equals(k))) { V oldValue = e.value; e.value = value; e.recordAccess(this); return oldValue; } } for (Entry<K,V> e = table[indexFor(hash, table.length)]; e != null; e = e.next) { Object k; if (e.hash == hash && ((k = e.key) == key || key.equals(k))) return e.value; }",Why does the get method of HashMap have a FOR loop?

Bad character spacing in JavaFX's font rendering (in Linux)," I've started developing an application in JavaFX and I've run in an issue, I could find very little helpful information about: The spacing of between characters in Linux is very uneven. I'm not talking about the width of different characters but of the spaces between the characters.It's visible in normal text, but the following example illustrates the effect better than normal text. Take a look at the first row. The space between the first two characters is smaller than between the second and third. This also happens between the sixth and seventh character and several others:Swing does not have this problem and JavaFX doesn't have this problem in Windows or it is barely visible on that OS. Neither does it appear to be a major issue on Mac.

How to debug exceptions thrown by async calls?," UPDATE: The latest version of Intellij IDEA implements exactly what I'm looking for. The question is how to implement this outside of the IDE (so I can to dump async stack traces to log files), ideally without the use of an instrumenting agent.Ever since I converted my application from a synchronous to asynchronous model I am having problems debugging failures.When I use synchronous APIs, I always find my classes in exception stacktraces so I know where to begin looking if something goes wrong. With asynchronous APIs, I am getting stacktraces that do not reference my classes nor indicate what request triggered the failure.I'll give you a concrete example, but I'm interested in a general solution to this kind of problem.Concrete exampleI make an HTTP request using Jersey: where rx() indicates that the request should take place asynchronously, returning a CompletionStage<JsonNode> instead of a JsonNode directly. If this call fails, I get this stacktrace: Notice:The stacktrace does not reference user code.The exception message does not contain contextual information about the HTTP request that triggered the error (HTTP method, URI, etc).As a result, I have no way of tracking the exception back to its source.Why this is happeningIf you dig under the hood, you will discover that Jersey is invoking: for rx() invocations. Because the supplier is constructed by Jersey, there is no reference back to user code.What I've triedI tried filing a bug report against Jetty for an unrelated async example, and was subsequently turned down on security grounds.Instead, I've been adding contextual information as follows: Meaning, I am manually adding exceptionally() after every single HTTP request in my code. Any exceptions thrown by Jersey are wrapped in a secondary exception that references my code. The resulting stacktrace looks like this: I don't like this approach because it is error prone and decreases the readability of the code. If I mistakenly omit this for some HTTP request I will end up with a vague stacktrace and spend a lot time tracking it down.Further, if I want to hide this trick behind a utility class then I have to instantiate an exception outside of a CompletionStage; otherwise, the utility class will show up in the stacktrace instead of the actual call site. Instantiating an exception outside of a CompletionStage is extremely expensive because this code runs even if no exception is ever thrown by the async call.My questionIs there a robust, easy-to-maintain approach to add contextual information to asynchronous calls?Alternatively, is there an efficient approach to track stacktraces back to their source without this contextual information? <code>  new Client().target(""http://test.com/"").request().rx().get(JsonNode.class); javax.ws.rs.ForbiddenException: HTTP 403 Authentication Failed at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation.convertToException(JerseyInvocation.java:1083) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation.translate(JerseyInvocation.java:883) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation.lambda$invoke$1(JerseyInvocation.java:767) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:316) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:298) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:229) at org.glassfish.jersey.process.internal.RequestScope.runInScope(RequestScope.java:414) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation.invoke(JerseyInvocation.java:765) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation$Builder.method(JerseyInvocation.java:456) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyCompletionStageRxInvoker.lambda$method$1(JerseyCompletionStageRxInvoker.java:70) at java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture$AsyncSupply.run(CompletableFuture.java:1590) CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> getSyncInvoker().method(name, entity, responseType)) makeHttpRequest().exceptionally(e ->{ throw new RuntimeException(e);}); java.lang.RuntimeException: javax.ws.rs.ForbiddenException: HTTP 403 Authentication Failed at my.user.code.Testcase.lambda$null$1(Testcase.java:25) at java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.uniExceptionally(CompletableFuture.java:870) ... 6 common frames omittedCaused by: javax.ws.rs.ForbiddenException: HTTP 403 Authentication Failed at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation.convertToException(JerseyInvocation.java:1083) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation.translate(JerseyInvocation.java:883) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation.lambda$invoke$1(JerseyInvocation.java:767) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:316) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:298) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:229) at org.glassfish.jersey.process.internal.RequestScope.runInScope(RequestScope.java:414) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation.invoke(JerseyInvocation.java:765) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyInvocation$Builder.method(JerseyInvocation.java:456) at org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyCompletionStageRxInvoker.lambda$method$1(JerseyCompletionStageRxInvoker.java:70) at java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture$AsyncSupply.run(CompletableFuture.java:1590) ... 3 common frames omitted",How to create async stacktraces?

Firestore chat app using FirebaseUI (Android)," I am trying to create a chat using the Firebase-UI library for Cloud Firestore.This github repository contains the relevant code which I am using.The problem comes with the order of the query.See that the query is specified as: However, I am getting the oldest 50 messages, instead of the newest ones, in the correct order (from old to new). On the other hand, I can use the following query: and this retrieves the 50 newest messages, but in the wrong order (newest on top, oldest on bottom). Hence I do not know how to get this right.I could locally reverse again the result from the query, but I cannot figure out how to do that (I have already gone through the FirebaseUI library with no luck).EDITI have my chat subcollection for each event in my events collection:events/event_doc/chat/chat_docAnd I would like to get the messages as follows: With the default order I get the messages like shown above, but the limit instructions cuts the snapshots from 1 to 50, and the Message 51 (the newest) is not being retrieved. <code>  Query sChatQuery = sChatCollection.orderBy(""timestamp"").limit(50); Query sChatQuery = sChatCollection.orderBy(""timestamp"", Query.Direction.DESCENDING).limit(50); Message 1Message 2Message 3Message 4...",Firestore chat app using Firebase-UI (Android)
How rollback transaction in spring boot application in same way as on weblogic," So in my weblogic application we are you using some jtaWeblogicTransactionManager. There is some default timeout which can be override in annotation @Transactional(timeout = 60). I created some infinity loop to read data from db which correctly timeout: now I would like to make same behavior in my spring boot application so I tried this: tm: and application.properties: but with no success. My infinity loop never ends (I wait about 15 minutes and then I stop my app). The only time when I saw rollback was when I tried Thread.sleep and after sleep this transaction timeout with rollback but this is not what I want to. So is there some way how to interrupt process after timeout(use timeout in annotation or use default) in same way how in my weblogic application ?UPDATEI tested it like this: }UPDATE2When I turn on atomikos debug I can see there is warning during init and some atomikos timer: maybe this is the reason. How I can fix this ? I am using oracle 12 with ojdbc8 driverUPDATE 3after fix UPDATE2 to grant user permission to db I can see in log warning: problem is that app is still reading data from db after this timeout. Why it is not rollbacked ?UPDATE 4so I found in ActiveStateHandler when timeout occurs there is code: and AtomikosConnectionProxy is checking timeout this way so why timeout is set state which not cause exception in AtomikosConnectionProxy ?UPDATE 5so I found that property will solve my problem and now it starts rollback how I want. But I still dont understand why I should set this to true because now I am testing it on some task which should run in single thread <code>  29 Apr 2018 20:44:55,458 WARN [[ACTIVE] ExecuteThread: '9' for queue: 'weblogic.kernel.Default (self-tuning)'] org.springframework.jdbc.support.SQLErrorCodesFactory : Error while extracting database name - falling back to empty error codesorg.springframework.jdbc.support.MetaDataAccessException: Error while extracting DatabaseMetaData;

I would like to create a ZonedDateTime object that is May 1, 2018, 12:00AM but of ANOTHER time zone (say EST). Because if I pass in that date object into ZonedDateTime, it treats that date object as UTC (so it treats it as May 1 2018, 12:00AM GMT), and I want it to preserve that date field values but change the timzeone to EST (May 1st 2018, 12:00AM EST).

Overriding a generic method in Java," I wonder why this is a valid override: Whereas this is not: According to JLS 8.4.8.1, B.getSupplier must be a subsignature A.getSupplier:An instance method mC declared in or inherited by class C, overrides from C another method mA declared in class A, iff all of the following are true:...The signature of mC is a subsignature (8.4.2) of the signature of mA....Subsignatures are defined in JLS 8.4.2:Two methods or constructors, M and N, have the same signature if they have the same name, the same type parameters (if any) (8.4.4), and, after adapting the formal parameter types of N to the the type parameters of M, the same formal parameter types.The signature of a method m1 is a subsignature of the signature of a method m2 if either:m2 has the same signature as m1, orthe signature of m1 is the same as the erasure (4.6) of the signature of m2.So it seems like B.getSupplier is a subsignature of A.getSupplier but B.getSuppliers is not a subsignature of A.getSuppliers.I wonder how it can be the case.If B.getSupplier is a subsignature of A.getSupplier because it has the same erasure, then B.getSuppliers must also have the same erasure as A.getSuppliers. This should suffice for overriding getSuppliers to be legal - but it does not.If B.getSupplier is a subsignature of A.getSupplier because it has the same signature, then I wonder what ""the same type parameters (if any)"" exactly means.If type parameters are considered, then they should have different type parameters: A.getSupplier has type parameter X, B.getSupplier has none.If type parameters are not considered then how's getSuppliers different?This is more of an academic question about overrides and generics so please don't suggest refactoring code (like moving type parameter X to the class etc.).I am looking for a formal, JLS-based answer.From my point of view B.getSupplier should not be able override A.getSupplier as they don't have the same type parameters.

Java's equivalent of arrayof()/ listof()/ setof()/ mapof() [Kotlin]," I was just wondering that if java has the equivalent of arrayof()/ listof()/ setof()/ mapof() like those in kotlin? If not, is there any way to work similarly? I found them very different from java.Btw, do intArrayOf()/ arraylistof()/ hashsetof()/ hashmapof() etc. do the same thing as int[]{}/ new new ArrayList<>()/ new HashSet<>()/ new HashMap<>() etc.? <code> ",Java's equivalent of arrayof()/ listof()/ setof()/ mapof() from Kotlin
Configure to execute multiple DeferredResults simultaneously," my applications should have 2 core endpoints: push, pull for sending and fetching data. Pull operation should works asynchronously and result DeferredResult. When user call pull service over rest, new DefferedResult is created and stored into Map<Long, DefferedResult> results = new ConcurrentHashMap<>() where is waiting for new data or until timeout is expired.Push operation call user over rest as well, and this operation checks map of results for recipient of data pushed by this operation. When map contains result of recipient, these data are set to his result, DefferedResult is returned.Here is base code: Code is working as I expected problem is that should also works for multiple users. I guess the max active users which will call pull operation will max 1000. So every call of pull take max 5 seconds as I set in DefferedResult but it isn't.As you can see in image, if I immediately call rest of pull operation from my javascript client multiple times you can see that tasks will executed sequentially instead of simultaneously. Tasks which I fired as last take about 25 seconds, but I need that when 1000 users execute at same time pull operation, that operation should take max 5 seconds + latency.How to configure my app to execute these tasks simultaneously and ensure each each task will about 5 seconds or less (when another user send something to waiting user)? I tried add this configuration into property file: and also this configuration: But it didn't help, still same result. Can you help me configure it please?EDIT:This is how I calling this service from angular: When I tried call it multiple times with pure JS code like this: it will execute every request call much faster (about 7 seconds). I expected that increasing is caused database calling in service, but it still better than 25 sec. Do I have something wrong with calling this service in angular?EDIT 2:I tried another form of testing and instead of browser I used jMeter. I execute 100 requests in 100 threads and here is result:As you can see requests will be proceed by 10, and after reach 50 requests application throw exception: I also comment code where I use Repositories to ensure there is nothing with database, and same result. ALso I set uniqe userId for each request with AtomicLong class.EDIT 3:I find out when I comment also @Transactional everything works fine! So can you tell me how to set spring's transactions for large amount of operations without increasing delay?I added spring.datasource.maximumPoolSize=1000 to increase pool size which I guess shoulds, so the only problem is how to speed up methods with @Transactional.Every call to pull method is annotated with @Transactional because I need at first load data from database and check if there are new data, because yes, I do not have to do creating waiting deferred result. push methods have to be annotation with @Transaction as well, because there I need at first store received data in database and next set that value to waiting results. For my data I am using Postgres. <code>  @Servicepublic class FooServiceImpl { Map<Long, DefferedResult> results = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(); @Transactional @Override public DeferredResult<String> pull(Long userId) { // here is database call, String data = fooRepository.getNewData(); where I check if there are some new data in database, and if there are, just return it, if not add deferred result into collection to wait for it DeferredResult<String> newResult = new DeferredResult<>(5000L); results.putIfAbsent(userId, newResult); newResult.onCompletion(() -> results.remove(userId)); // if (data != null) // newResult.setResult(data); return newResult; } @Transactional @Override public void push(String data, Long recipientId) { // fooRepository.save(data, recipientId); if (results.containsKey(recipientId)) { results.get(recipientId).setResult(data); } }} server.tomcat.max-threads=1000 @Configurationpublic class AsyncConfig extends AsyncSupportConfigurer { @Override

Is this a good way to handle exceptions in Spring Boot?," I was reading the Spring docs and found that creating a subclass from ResponseEntityExceptionHandler was a good way on handling exceptions. However, I tried to handle exceptions in a different way, since I need to diff BusinessExceptions from TechnicalExceptions. Created a bean called BusinessFault which encapsulates the exception details:BusinessFault.java Created a BusinessException class, which do the job by creating a BusinessFault beans through the details passed by its constructor:BusinessException.java Created a specific UserNotFoundException class, which extends from BusinessException class:UserNotFoundException.java Created a BusinessExceptionHandler, but instead of being a subclass of ResponseEntityExceptionHandler, it's only has a @ControllerAdvice annotation and a method that handles all thrown BusinessExceptions:BusinessExceptionHandler.java The service layer can throw a UserNotFoundException: It works fine.

Java: How to html escape a javascript object to protect against XSS?," In Java, we've got some code that takes a complex java object and serializes it to json. It then writes that json directly to the markup of a page, in a script tag, assigning it to a variable. The complex object can have end user content in it, which could open us up to XSS attacks.How can I get a json version of the complex java object that has each json attribute HTML escaped, to protect against XSS injection?I've read the OWASP XSS Guide and the best I've come up with so far is this, which HTML escapes the entire JSON string, then undoes the quotes, so it can be assigned to a variable in javascript. I'm sure there are better ways to do this, but this seems to work. Any suggestions? <code>  // Get object as JSON using JacksonObjectWriter jsonWriter = new ObjectMapper().writer().withDefaultPrettyPrinter();String json = jsonWriter.writeValueAsString(complexObject);// Write JSON out to page, and assign it to a javascript variable.Writer out = environment.getOut();out.write(""var data = "" + json); private String objectToHtmlEscapedJson(Object value) { try { String result = jsonWriter.writeValueAsString(value); result = StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml(result); result = result.replace(""&quot;"", ""\""""); return result; } catch (JsonProcessingException e) { return ""null""; }}",Java and XSS: How to html escape a JSON string to protect against XSS?

"Inner classes, inheritance. Exercise Java"," I was solving some exercises to understand better how inner classes in java work. I found one quite interesting exercise. The condition of the exercise is to make printName() print ""sout"" instead of ""main"" with minimum changes. There is its code: We've got an amusing situation - the two classes have is-A and has-A connections. It means that the anonymous inner class extends the outer class and also objects of the inner class have references to the objects of the outer class. If you run the code above, ""main"" will be printed. The child cannot invoke getName() of the parent through inheritance. But the child being inner class uses reference to parent(outer class) to access the method.The simplest way to solve this task is to change the access modifier of getName() from private to anything else. So the child is able to use getName() through inheritance and thanks to late binding ""sout"" will be printed.The another way to solve this task is to use super.getName(). And I cannot understand how it works. Can someone help me to understand this problem? Thank you for trying) <code>  public class Solution { private String name; Solution(String name) { this.name = name; } private String getName() { return name; } private void sout() { new Solution(""sout"") { void printName() { System.out.println(getName()); // the line above is an equivalent to: // System.out.println(Solution.this.getName); } }.printName(); } public static void main(String[] args) { new Solution(""main"").sout(); }} private void sout() { new Solution(""sout"") { void printName() { System.out.println(super.getName()); } }.printName();}",Why do method() and super.method() refer to different things in an anonymous subclass?

How do I preserve the existing response when handling an exception," Spring Boot seems to have a default behavior for handling certain exceptions.I have a rest controller.

Couldn't Spring Reactor or Non blocking pattern be bad for scaling," I get that with threads being nonblocking, we don't need to have Thread sprawl depending on N concurrent requests, but rather we put our tasks in a single event loop in our reactive web programming pattern.Yes, that can help, but since the event loop is a queue, what if the first task to be processed blocks forever? Then the event loop will never progress and thus end of responses and processing other than queueing more tasks. Yes, timeouts are probably possible, but I can't wrap my head around how the event loop can be a good solution.Say you have 3 tasks that take 3 seconds to wait for IO and run each executions and they got submitted to the event queue. Then they will still take 9 seconds to be able to be processed and also to execute once IO resolved. In the case of making threads that block, this would have resolved in 3 seconds since they run concurrently. Where I can see a benefit is if the event loop is not really a queue and upon signal that a task is ready to be processed, it dispatches that task to be processed. In that case though, this would mean that order of task execution is not maintained and also each task has to still be running a thread in order to be able to tell when IO is resolved.Maybe I am not understanding the event loop and thread handling correctly. Can someone correct me please because it seems like this Reactor pattern seems to make things possibly worse.Lastly, upon X requests in Spring Reactor, does only 1 thread get created to run handlers instead of the traditional X threads? In that case, if someone accidently wrote blocking code, doesnt that mean each subsequent requests get queued?  <code> ",Couldn't Spring Webflux or Non blocking pattern be bad for scaling

Java memory barrier after object construction," The Java memory model guarantees a happens-before relationship between an object's construction and finalizer: There is a happens-before edge from the end of a constructor of an object to the start of a finalizer (12.6) for that object.As well as the constructor and the initialization of final fields: An object is considered to be completely initialized when its constructor finishes. A thread that can only see a reference to an object after that object has been completely initialized is guaranteed to see the correctly initialized values for that object's final fields.There's also a guarantee about volatile fields since, there's a happens-before relations with regard to all access to such fields: A write to a volatile field (8.3.1.4) happens-before every subsequent read of that field.But what about regular, good old non-volatile fields? I've seen a lot of multi-threaded code that doesn't bother creating any sort of memory barrier after object construction with non-volatile fields. But I've never seen or heard of any issues because of it and I wasn't able to recreate such partial construction myself. Do modern JVMs just put memory barriers after construction? Avoid reordering around construction? Or was I just lucky? If it's the latter, is it possible to write code that reproduces partial construction at will?Edit:To clarify, I'm talking about the following situation.

Nothing prevents it from seeing the writes in the opposite order. So it could see a fully built Foo object, but with the bar field equal to equal to 0.Edit2:I took a second look at the example above a few months after writing it.

Java - how much time delay is required to ensure cache coherence between threads?," Consider the following piece of code (which isn't quite what it seems at first glance). My question is: In order to be absolutely certain that ""Problem!!!"" won't be printed, does the ""value"" variable in the NumberContainer class need to be marked volatile?Let me explain how I currently understand this.In the first parallel stream, NumberContainer-123 (say) is incremented by ForkJoinWorker-1 (say). So ForkJoinWorker-1 will have an up-to-date cache of NumberContainer-123.value, which is 1. (Other fork-join workers, however, will have out-of-date caches of NumberContainer-123.value - they will store the value 0. At some point, these other workers' caches will be updated, but this doesn't happen straight away.)The first parallel stream finishes, but the common fork-join pool worker threads aren't killed. The second parallel stream then starts, using the very same common fork-join pool worker threads. Suppose, now, that in the second parallel stream, the task of incrementing NumberContainer-123 is assigned to ForkJoinWorker-2 (say). ForkJoinWorker-2 will have its own cached value of NumberContainer-123.value. If a long period of time has elapsed between the first and second increments of NumberContainer-123, then presumably ForkJoinWorker-2's cache of NumberContainer-123.value will be up-to-date, i.e. the value 1 will be stored, and everything is good. But what if the time elapsed between first and second increments if NumberContainer-123 is extremely short? Then perhaps ForkJoinWorker-2's cache of NumberContainer-123.value might be out of date, storing the value 0, causing the code to fail!Is my description above correct? If so, can anyone please tell me what kind of time delay between the two incrementing operations is required to guarantee cache consistency between the threads? Or if my understanding is wrong, then can someone please tell me what mechanism causes the thread-local caches to be ""flushed"" in between the first parallel stream and the second parallel stream? <code>  static class NumberContainer { int value = 0; void increment() { value++; } int getValue() { return value; }}public static void main(String[] args) { List<NumberContainer> list = new ArrayList<>(); int numElements = 100000; for (int i = 0; i < numElements; i++) { list.add(new NumberContainer()); } int numIterations = 10000; for (int j = 0; j < numIterations; j++) { list.parallelStream().forEach(NumberContainer::increment); } list.forEach(container -> { if (container.getValue() != numIterations) { System.out.println(""Problem!!!""); } });}",Java - cache coherence between successive parallel streams?
Access the injected (deserialized) parameter values from a filter/interceptor," I'm trying to enrich the SLF4J MDC on each request with the user's ID. The problem is that the ID can be passed in many ways, sometimes as a path parameter, sometimes in the body, and sometimes injected by a custom ValueFactoryProvider that first decrypts it.If I could somehow access all the injected (i.e. already deserialized) parameter values, I could handle all these cases easily.E.g.For a resource such as: I could have a filter such as: But I don't see a way to implement somehowGetTheValue either from a ContainerRequestFilter an interceptor or anything else... <code>  @GET//@Encrypted params are injected by a custom ValueFactoryProviderpublic Something getSomething(@Encrypted(""userId"") String userId) { return ...;}@POSTpublic Something getSomething(@RequestBody RequestWithUserId requestWithUserId) { return ...;} public class MdcFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter, ContainerResponseFilter { @Context private ResourceInfo resourceInfo; @Override public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext) throws IOException { Method theMethod = resourceInfo.getResourceMethod(); for (Parameter parameter : theMethod.getParameters()) { //Deal with the @Encrypted case if (parameter.isAnnotationPresent(Encrypted.class) && parameter.getAnnotation(Encrypted.class).value().equals(""userId"")) { MDC.put(""userId"", somehowGetTheValue()); } //Deal with the @RequestBody case if (parameter.isAnnotationPresent(RequestBody.class) && parameter.getType().equals(RequestWithUserId.class)) { MDC.put(""userId"", ((RequestWithUserId)somehowGetTheValue()).getUserId()); } ... //other possibilities } } @Override public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext, ContainerResponseContext responseContext) throws IOException { MDC.clear(); }}",Access resource method arguments from inside a Jersey filter or interceptor.

I went through several questions and a couple of articles, but I did not find a clear answer. <code>  ExpectedPackage ep = expectedPackageRepository.findById(1).orElse(null);if(ep != null){ ep.setDateModified(new Date()); expectedPackageRepository.saveAndFlush(ep);} Optional<ExpectedPackage> ep = expectedPackageRepository.findById(1);if(ep.isPresent()){ ep.get().setDateModified(new Date()); expectedPackageRepository.saveAndFlush(ep.get());}",Optional isPresent vs orElse(null)

Oracle Java tutorial - static classes - possible error at tutorial," I'm new to Java, learning Java from the Oracle Java tutorial.I'm now learning about nested classes, static classes and inner classes.I found the following explanation which seems odd, and I think it is wrong.From: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html A nested class is a member of its enclosing class. Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class, even if they are declared private. Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing classThe last sentence ""Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing class"" is strange, but may refer to instance members, saying the static class is like a static method, having no access to instance variables.But the next note is even stranger: Note: A static nested class interacts with the instance members of its outer class (and other classes) just like any other top-level class. In effect, a static nested class is behaviorally a top-level class that has been nested in another top-level class for packaging convenience.This seems odd, as it implies that a static class cannot access private instance members of the outer class. I've written the following code which compiles and runs, and demonstrates that a static class can access outer instance private variables. Is this a mistake in the tutorial, or am I maybe not understanding something well?Thanks <code>  public class A { private int x; static private int y; static public class B{ static void doSomething(){ y++; System.out.println(""y is now "" + y ); } static void doSomethingElse(A a) { a.x++; System.out.println(""a.x is "" + a.x ); } }}// ------public class Main { public static void main(String[] args){ A a = new A(); A.B b = new A.B(); b.doSomething(); b.doSomethingElse(a); }}",Oracle Java tutorial - static classes - possible error in tutorial
Java: Implementing methods using default methods of interfaces - Contradictory? (inheritance structure)," IntroductionI have read multiple posts about implementing interfaces and abstract classes here on SO. I have found one in particular that I would like to link here - Link - Interface with default methods vs abstract class, it covers the same question. As the accepted answer, it is recommended to use the default methods of interfaces when it is possible to do this. But the comment below this answer stating ""this feature feels more like a hack to me"" explains my problem.Default methods have been introduced to make implementations of interfaces more flexible - when an interface is changed it is not necessarily required in the implementing classes to (re)write code. Therefore, using a default method of an interface just to realize a method in all implementing classes - quote: ""feels more like a hack to me"". Example for my examination:Classes overview:Item - Abstract Superclass of all ItemsWater - Item which is consumableStone - Item which is not consumableConsumable - Interface with some methods for consumable items (those methods have to be overriden by all implementing classes)Combining those:Water is an Item and implements Consumable; Stone is also an Item and does not implement Consumable. My examinationI would like to implement a method which all Items have to implement. Therefore, I declare the signature in the class Item. Quick edit: I am aware that instanceof might solve this particular example - if possible think of a more complicated example that makes it necessary to implement the method in the first place. (Thanks to Sp00m and Eugene)Now I have several options: Implement the method by hand in every single subclass of Item (this is definitely not possible when scaling the application). As mentioned above when scaling the application this would be impractical or highly inefficient. Implementing the method inside of the interface as a default method so the Consumable classes already implement the method which is required by the superclass Item. This is the solution recommended by the other post - I see the advantages of implementing it in this way: Quote - ""The good thing about this new feature is that, where before you were forced to use an abstract class for the convenience methods, thus constraining the implementor to single inheritance, now you can have a really clean design with just the interface and a minimum of implementation effort forced on the programmer."" LinkBut in my opinion, it still seems contradictory to the original idea of default methods which I mentioned in my introduction. Furthermore, when scaling the application and introducing more methods that share the same implementation for all Consumables (as the example method isConsumable()), the interface would implement several default methods which contradicts the idea of an interface not implementing the actual method. Introducing sub-superclasses instead of an interface - for example the class Consumable as an abstract subclass of Item and superclass of Water. It offers the opportunity to write the default case for a method in Item (example: isConsumable() //return false) and afterwards override this in the sub-superclass. The problem that occurs here: When scaling the application and introducing more sub-superclasses (as the Consumable class), the actual Items would start to extend more than one sub-superclass. It might not be a bad thing because it is necessary to do the same with interfaces too but it makes the inheritance tree complicated - Example: An item might now extend a subsuperclass ALayer2 which is a sub-superclass of ALayer1 which extends Item (layer0). Introducing another superclass (thus same layer as Item) - for example the class Consumable as an abstract class which will be another superclass of Water. That means that Water would have to extend Item & Consumable This option offers flexibility. It is possible to create a whole new inheritance tree for the new superclass while still being able to see the actual inheritance of Item. But the downside I discovered is the implementation of this structure in the actual classes and using those later on - Example: How would I be able to say: A Consumable is an Item when Consumable would be able to have subclasses that are not meant for Items. The whole converting process will possibly cause a headache - more likely than the structure of Option 3.QuestionWhat would be the right option to implement this structure? Is it one of my listed options?Is it a variation of those?Or is it another option I have not thought about, yet?I have chosen a very simple example - please keep scalability for future implementations in mind when answering. Thanks for any help in advance.Edit#1Java does not allow multiple inheritance. This will effect the option 4.Using multiple interfaces (because you can implement more than one) might be a workaround, unfortunately the default-method will be necessary again which is exactly the kind of implementation I have been trying to avoid originally.

why my primitive-type argumented method doesnt override wrapper-type argumented super class method?," This prints Number Class Type.I understand the rules of wrapper class method overloading:If you are passing a primitive data type as an argument to the methodcall, the compiler first checks for a method definition which takes thesame data type as an argument.If such a method does not exist, then it checks for a methoddefinition which takes a larger-sized primitive data type than the passeddata type. I.e., it tries to perform auto-widening conversion of thepassed data type.If auto-widening conversion is not possible, then it checks for amethod definition which takes the corresponding wrapper class type as anargument. I.e., it tries to perform auto-boxing conversion.If such a method does not exist, then it checks for a method whichtakes the super class type (Number or Object type) as an argument.If such a method also does not exist, then the compiler gives acompile-time error.According to rule 1, it should print Integer Class Type. What am I missing here? <code>  public class WrapperClasses{ void overloadedMethod(Number N){ System.out.println(""Number Class Type""); } void overloadedMethod(Double D){ System.out.println(""Double Wrapper Class Type""); } void overloadedMethod(Long L){ System.out.println(""Long Wrapper Class Type""); } public static void main(String[] args){ int i = 21; WrapperClasses wr = new WrapperClasses(); //wr.overloadedMethod(i); }}class mine extends WrapperClasses{ void overloadedMethod(int N){ System.out.println(""Integer Class Type""); } public static void main(String[] args){ int i = 21; WrapperClasses wr = new mine(); wr.overloadedMethod(i); }}",Why doesn't my primitive-type-argumented method override the wrapper-type-argumented super class method?

How to demonstrate java instruction reordering problems?," With Java instruction reordering the execution order of the code is changed by the JVM at compile time or run time, possibly causing unrelated statements to be executed out-of-order.Edit: [Instruction reordering can produce counter-intuitive results. Many CPU architectures can reorder the memory interactions of machine instructions which leads to similar unexpected results even if the compiler did not change the instruction order. Thus, the term memory reordering may be a better fit than instruction reordering.]So my question is:Can someone provide an example Java program/snippet, that reliably shows an instruction reordering problem, that is not caused also by other synchronization issues ( such as caching/visibility or non-atomic r/w, as in my failed attempt at such a demo in my previous question )To emphasize, I am not looking for examples of theoretical reordering issues. What I am looking for is a way to actually demonstrate them by seeing incorrect or unexpected results of a running program.Barring a faulty behavior example, just showing actual reordering happening in the assembly of a simple program could also be nice. <code> ",How to demonstrate Java instruction reordering problems?

When running I get the following errors: and I have also tried to increase max and initial heap size by setting the KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS environment variable by running but still doesn't work.

Mixing Spring Web Security Annotations with XML Configuration," TL;DRIs there a way to mix Spring Web Security configuration with both annotations and xml?Full StoryFor our legacy spring web application we are looking into using annotation driven configuration for part of our web security.Currently all our web security (<security:http>) is driven by xml based configuration. But we are adding a new login mechanism (SAML 2.0) that seems like it would be much easier to configure via annotations than xml.We have been attempting to mix the use of annotations and xml, but it seems as though only one or the other works. Meaning that when any xml based web security is referenced, either via an xml (<import resource=""classpath:web-security.xml""/> or via the @ImportResource annotation, the annotation based web security is ignored.If we remove references to the xml based configuration our annotation configuration gets called.Any friendly suggestions or advice is appreciated. <code> ",Mixing Spring Annotations with XML Config for Spring Web Security
java.awt.Desktop class in Android," I am using a Google API for android. Since Google API/G Suite Quickstart for android refers to their java examples, I am trying to implement this: The problem, I am encountering now is that Android just support a subset of JDK classes. Therefore java.awt.Desktop isn't supported.But I really need this class, since AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp's authorize() will soon or later call its intern function browse(). This function needs the Desktop class.Is there a way to get that class for android? Or is there another workaround to authenticate with Google? <code>  GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow flow = new GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow.Builder( ReadMail.HTTP_TRANSPORT, ReadMail.JSON_FACTORY, clientSecrets, ReadMail.SCOPES) .setDataStoreFactory(ReadMail.DATA_STORE_FACTORY) .setAccessType(""offline"") .build(); AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp authCodeInstalledApp = new AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp(flow, new LocalServerReceiver()); Credential credential = authCodeInstalledApp.authorize(""user"");",java.awt.Desktop class

How do I use mySql in a Spring Boot unit test?," I've got a simple little ""hello world"" Spring Boot app. It has a single entity (""IssueReport"") and it's configured to run mySQL (instead of the default H2 embedded database).The app itself runs fine. I created a mySql database and user, Spring Boot/Hibernate created the table and successfully populates and reads the mySQL data when I run the app. Life is Good - there are no problems with mySQL and my Spring Boot app itself.Q: Now how do I use mySQL (instead of the embedded H2) in unit tests?I created a second, separate mySQL database: test2_test_db.I'm using Spring Boot 2.0.6; Eclipse Photon on STS 3.9.6; Ubuntu Linux.I created application-test.properties in src/test/resources/: Here's the entire unit test: Here's the console error: Q: What's the EASIEST change so I can run my unit tests with mySQL, just as I'm able to run my Spring Boot app with mySQL?Q: Is ""@DataJpaTest"" the best choice here, or should I try a different annotation?Q: Must I create a separate ""Bean"" class?

Camera preview is fine but produces very dark photos," I built a custom camera using the Camera 1 API and for some reason it produces very dark pictures (only on the front camera, the back camera works perfectly fine).

"What are the domains for JShell, Java, and single source execution?"," I found this question, and this other, so intriguing that it begs several questions, at least for me: Rather open-ended question, but where is jshell confined to?

The JShell API is intended to allow JShell functionality in IDEs and other tools, but the jshell tool is not intended to be an IDE.Bonus points for Venn diagrams or other visuals.Certainly, snippets should be limited in size.

Duplicate classes in different java libraries leads to compilation errors," I am having trouble with the Appium java client because it seems they did weird things with their project.Basically, they are using Selenium in their project which should work just fine but they copied one package from Selenium partly to their project (org.openqa.selenium) and made some small adaptions to the classes inside. Basically, they added generics to the interfaces. Now we have duplicate classes in the same package in different libraries which of course leads to problems.I created a simple Gradle project to demonstrate that.Following my build.gradle: And my class Interactions.java: Now if I compile that project I get the following error: I think it is ambiguous because the interface WebElement exists twice.How can I fix that problem?Using appium-client <= 4.0.0 would work, but I need a newer version.Currently, I just deleted the duplicate package from the jar and included this jar into my project. I really just deleted it with 7zip. This clears that compilation error but I will probably soon face other problems because the appium jar is not complete and the appium project would not even compile without that package. The Selenium guys probably won't change anything (https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/863).The Appium guys probably don't know how to fix that, so am I: https://github.com/appium/java-client/issues/1021Solution:With help of the accepted answer I was able to fix those issues.Although I needed to come up with a slightly different solution.The problem I faced was that classes which called my Interactions.java needed those casts too which would lead in 1000+ adaptions. To prevent this I changed my methods to take Object as parameter: It might not be an optimal solution but it works and won't need changes in all our other classes and everyone can work with those Interaction methods as until now. <code>  plugins { id 'java-library'}dependencies { api 'io.appium:java-client:6.1.0'}repositories { jcenter()} import org.openqa.selenium.By;import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;public class Interactions { public static void touchWebElement(By by, WebDriver driver) { touchWebElement(driver.findElement(by), driver); } public static void touchWebElement(WebElement element, WebDriver driver) { // DO SOMETHING }} The method touchWebElement(By, WebDriver) is ambiguous for the type Interactions Interactions.java line 8 import org.openqa.selenium.By;import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;public class Interactions { public static void touchWebElement(Object object, WebDriver driver){ WebElement webElement = castObjectToWebElement(element, driver); //DO SOMETHING } private static WebElement castObjectToWebElement(Object object, WebDriver driver) { if (object instanceof WebElement) { return (WebElement) object; } else if (object instanceof By) { return driver.findElement((By) object); } throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid type""); }}",Duplicate classes in different Java libraries leads to compilation errors

When Are Enum Values Defined?," I'm trying to implement something in a semi-efficient manner. In my program, I have an enumerator representing metrics that are used to pass information around in the program.I have a class that lets me ""compose"" these metrics into a single object so I can essentially create a ""sentence"" to give me complex information without having to do any complex parsing of information. They're essentially bit flags, but since I'm using an enum, I can have more than just 64 of them.The problem is that if I'm instantiating instances of this container class a lot, and I go to create an array like so: I feel like creating an array of the enumerated values so often just to request its size is wasteful. I'm wondering if it's possible to just define the size of the enumerated values() in a static context so it's a constant value I don't have to recalculate: Can I do this? Or would the compiler not have defined the enumerated values before it declares this static variable? I know this isn't the best explanation of my question, but I'm not sure how else to word it.I know the static variable will be determined at runtime (unless the value assigned to it were a literal value), so would the program be able to request the members of the Metrics enum at this point in execution? <code>  metrics = new boolean[Metrics.values().length]; private static final int METRIC_COUNT = Metrics.values().length;",When are enum values defined?
Refactor a mehod to using stream API," I am currently told to count all .sql files which are hangin' out on some servers. Manually solving this very basic task is not an option, instead, I wrote some code that makes use of a SimpleFileVisitor<Path> and stores all the sql files found along with its parent path in a Map<Path, List<Path>>.Now I want to receive the total amount of sql files found independent from their locations. I got it working with an enhanced for loop (almost the classic way): The question is now, how can I do the same using the stream API?I wasn't able to get compilable code to work which isn't obviously doing the wrong thing.The following line looks like a good idea to me, but not to the compiler, unfortunately. The compiler saysCannot infer type argument(s) for <R> map(Function<? super T,? extends R>Does anyone know what I am doing wrong (and maybe provide some educated stream-API using solution)? <code>  public int getTotalAmountOfSqlFiles(Map<Path, List<Path>> sqlFilesInDirectories) { int totalAmount = 0; for (Path directory : sqlFilesInDirectories.keySet()) { List<Path> sqlFiles = sqlFilesInDirectories.get(directory); totalAmount += sqlFiles.size(); } return totalAmount;} totalAmount = sqlFilesInDirectories.entrySet().stream().map(List::size).sum();",Refactor a method to using stream API

Authowiring conflict in spring core with the xml configuration," Taking as reference the post Spring @Autowired and @QualifierWe have this example to fix the autowiring conflict : There are two beans, Car and Bike implements Vehicle interface.

Processing Stuck in Dataflow Writer," I have a Dataflow job that reads data from pubsub and based on the time and filename writes the contents to GCS where the folder path is based on the YYYY/MM/DD. This allows files to be generated in folders based on date and uses apache beam's FileIO and Dynamic Destinations.About two weeks ago, I noticed an unusual buildup of unacknowledged messages. Upon restarting the df job the errors disappeared and new files were being written in GCS.After a couple of days, writing stopped again, except this time, there were errors claiming that processing was stuck. After some trusty SO research, I found out that this was likely caused by a deadlock issue in pre 2.90 Beam because it used the Conscrypt library as the default security provider. So, I upgraded to Beam 2.11 from Beam 2.8. Once again, it worked, until it didn't. I looked more closely at the error and noticed that it had a problem with a SimpleDateFormat object, which isn't thread-safe. So, I switched to use Java.time and DateTimeFormatter, which is thread-safe. It worked until it didn't. However, this time, the error was slightly different and didn't point to anything in my code:The error is provided below. This error started occurring approximately 5 hours after job deployment and at an increasing rate over time. Writing slowed significantly within 24 hours. I have 60 workers and I suspect that one worker fails every time there is an error, which eventually kills the job.In my writer, I parse the lines for certain keywords (may not be the best way) in order to determine which folder it belongs in. I then proceed to insert the file to GCS with the determined filename. Here is the code I use for my writer:The partition function is provided as the following: And the actual place where the pipeline is deployed and run can be found below: <code>  Processing stuck in step FileIO.Write/WriteFiles/WriteShardedBundlesToTempFiles/WriteShardsIntoTempFiles for at least 05m00s without outputting or completing in state process at sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method) at java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:175) at org.apache.beam.vendor.guava.v20_0.com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractFuture.get(AbstractFuture.java:469) at org.apache.beam.vendor.guava.v20_0.com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractFuture$TrustedFuture.get(AbstractFuture.java:76) at org.apache.beam.runners.dataflow.worker.MetricTrackingWindmillServerStub.getStateData(MetricTrackingWindmillServerStub.java:202) at org.apache.beam.runners.dataflow.worker.WindmillStateReader.startBatchAndBlock(WindmillStateReader.java:409) at org.apache.beam.runners.dataflow.worker.WindmillStateReader$WrappedFuture.get(WindmillStateReader.java:311) at org.apache.beam.runners.dataflow.worker.WindmillStateReader$BagPagingIterable$1.computeNext(WindmillStateReader.java:700) at org.apache.beam.vendor.guava.v20_0.com.google.common.collect.AbstractIterator.tryToComputeNext(AbstractIterator.java:145) at org.apache.beam.vendor.guava.v20_0.com.google.common.collect.AbstractIterator.hasNext(AbstractIterator.java:140) at org.apache.beam.vendor.guava.v20_0.com.google.common.collect.MultitransformedIterator.hasNext(MultitransformedIterator.java:47) at org.apache.beam.sdk.io.WriteFiles$WriteShardsIntoTempFilesFn.processElement(WriteFiles.java:701) at org.apache.beam.sdk.io.WriteFiles$WriteShardsIntoTempFilesFn$DoFnInvoker.invokeProcessElement(Unknown Source) @SuppressWarnings(""serial"")public static class datePartition implements SerializableFunction<String, String> { private String filename; public datePartition(String filename) { this.filename = filename; } @Override public String apply(String input) { String folder_name = ""NaN""; String date_dtf = ""NaN""; String date_literal = ""NaN""; try { Matcher foldernames = Pattern.compile(""\""foldername\"":\""(.*?)\"""").matcher(input); if(foldernames.find()) { folder_name = foldernames.group(1); } else { Matcher folderid = Pattern.compile(""\""folderid\"":\""(.*?)\"""").matcher(input); if(folderid.find()) { folder_name = folderid.group(1); } } Matcher date_long = Pattern.compile(""\""timestamp\"":\""(.*?)\"""").matcher(input); if(date_long.find()) { date_literal = date_long.group(1); if(Utilities.isNumeric(date_literal)) { LocalDateTime date = LocalDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.ofEpochMilli(Long.valueOf(date_literal)), ZoneId.systemDefault()); date_dtf = date.format(dtf); } else { date_dtf = date_literal.split("":"")[0].replace(""-"", ""/"").replace(""T"", ""/""); } } return folder_name + ""/"" + date_dtf + ""h/"" + filename; } catch(Exception e) { LOG.error(""ERROR with either foldername or date""); LOG.error(""Line : "" + input); LOG.error(""folder : "" + folder_name); LOG.error(""Date : "" + date_dtf); return folder_name + ""/"" + date_dtf + ""h/"" + filename; } }} public void streamData() { Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create(options); pipeline.apply(""Read PubSub Events"", PubsubIO.readMessagesWithAttributes().fromSubscription(options.getInputSubscription())) .apply(options.getWindowDuration() + "" Window"", Window.<PubsubMessage>into(FixedWindows.of(parseDuration(options.getWindowDuration()))) .triggering(AfterWatermark.pastEndOfWindow()) .discardingFiredPanes() .withAllowedLateness(parseDuration(""24h""))) .apply(new GenericFunctions.extractMsg()) .apply(FileIO.<String, String>writeDynamic() .by(new datePartition(options.getOutputFilenamePrefix())) .via(TextIO.sink()) .withNumShards(options.getNumShards()) .to(options.getOutputDirectory()) .withNaming(type -> FileIO.Write.defaultNaming(type, "".txt"")) .withDestinationCoder(StringUtf8Coder.of())); pipeline.run();}",Issues with Dynamic Destinations in Dataflow

Jacoco test coverage reports much lower on Java 11," I have several Gradle projects that were built using Java 8, and after converting them recently to use Java 11, Jacoco code coverage reports have been reporting much lower percentages than before. On one project, immediately after the transition, my coverage dropped from 81% to 16%.I tried updating the Jacoco plugin to 0.8.3 (which has official JDK 11 support), Gradle to 5.4, and TestNG to 6.14.3 (not sure if this has any effect; thought it couldn't hurt to be on the latest version). Even after these changes, the project I mentioned above has 16% coverage. I manually checked a few of the classes it reported 0% coverage on and found that they actually did have test coverage on them. For example, I added this method to one of my classes: I then used it in a test: And the coverage reported as 0:If it's helpful, here are my Jacoco Gradle settings. I'm using a custom plugin to configure them. As far as I'm able to gather, Java 11 should be fully supported for Jacoco coverage given the versions of the tools I'm using. What am I missing here? <code>  public String helloWorld(){ return ""hello""; } @Test(groups = IntegrationTest.INTEGRATION_GROUP) public void testHelloWorld() { String helloWorld = authManager.helloWorld(); assertEquals(helloWorld, ""hello""); } class ManagedJacocoPlugin implements ManagedPlugin { @Override void apply(PluginManager pluginManager) { pluginManager.apply(JacocoPlugin.class) } @Override void configure(Project project, GradlePluginConfig pluginConfig) { def jacoco = project.extensions.getByName(""jacoco"") jacoco.toolVersion = ""0.8.3"" def jacocoTestReport = project.tasks.getByName('jacocoTestReport') jacocoTestReport.reports { xml.enabled false csv.enabled false } project.tasks.withType(Test).each { t -> t.jacoco { destinationFile = project.file(""$project.buildDir/jacoco/test.exec"") } } jacocoTestReport.dependsOn ""integrationTest"" }}",Jacoco code coverage dropped with migration to Java 11
When JRE was completely discontinued as separate offering?," Starting from Java 9 the module system was introduced, making provision of JRE separately redundant.Through, it seems that it was still possible to download it. For example, from here now Java 9 archiveAlso, here it's only stated that :Restructure the JDK and JRE run-time images to draw a clear distinction between files that developers, deployers, and end-users can rely upon and, when appropriate, modify, in contrast to files that are internal to the implementation and subject to change without notice.The new image structure eliminates this distinction: A JDK image is simply a run-time image that happens to contain the full set of development tools and other items historically found in the JDK.So no talk about complete removal.From : jdk-9When you install jdk-9, public jre-9 also gets installed automatically.Also, I was thinking that started from Java 9 the custom runtime should be always created using the jlink, but it seems it's enforced now only from Java 11.From the release notes of Java 11 here Oracle JDK release notes:In Windows and macOS, installing the JDK in previous releases optionally installed a JRE. In JDK 11, this is no longer an option.In this release, the JRE or Server JRE is no longer offered. Only the JDK is offered. Users can use jlink to create smaller custom runtimes.But then I can find a lot of discussions like those:Where is Java 9 JRE?Create jre from OpenJDK WindowsWhy did Java 11 JRE not install with JDK and where is the download for just the Java 11 JRE?Is there an openjdk-11-jre?Is this the case and it is not possible to download JRE directly since Java 11? Or am I mixing implementations between (Oracle and OpenJDK)? Or were those discussions above misleading?Edit: I don't need to download the jre, I could create it via jlink or use already avaialble solution, my question is more of a theoretic. <code> ",When JRE was completely discontinued as a separate offering?
Thread.sleep inside infinite while loop doesn't throw exception - why?," My question is about InterruptedException, which is thrown from the Thread.sleep method.

But when I am trying to change the loop condition and replace ""true"" with some variable like this: The compiler constantly complains that InterruptedException has to be handled. Can someone explain to me why this happens, and why if the condition is set to true the compiler ignores the InterruptedException? <code>  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); executor.submit(() -> { while(true) { //DO SOMETHING Thread.sleep(5000); } }); ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); executor.submit(() -> { while(tasksObserving) { //DO SOMETHING Thread.sleep(5000); } });",Thread.sleep inside infinite while loop in lambda doesn't require 'catch (InterruptedException)' - why not?

Can method result Java Streams be safely processed without isFinite() and isOrdered() methods?," There is the question on whether java methods should return Collections or Streams, in which Brian Goetz answers that even for finite sequences, Streams should usually be preferred.But it seems to me that currently many operations on Streams that come from other places cannot be safely performed, and defensive code guards are not possible because Streams do not reveal if they are infinite or unordered.If parallel was a problem to the operations I want to perform on a Stream(), I can call isParallel() to check or sequential to make sure computation is in parallel (if i remember to).But if orderedness or finity(sizedness) was relevant to the safety of my program, I cannot write safeguards.Assuming I consume a library implementing this fictitious interface: Then what operations can I safely call on this stream to write a correct algorithm?It seems if I maybe want to do write the elements to a file as a side-effect, I need to be concerned about the stream being parallel: And also if it is parallel, based on what Threadpool is it parallel?If I want to sort the stream (or other non-short-circuit operations), I somehow need to be cautious about it being infinite: I can impose a limit before sorting, but which magic number should that be, if I expect a finite stream of unknown size?Finally maybe I want to compute in parallel to save time and then collect the result: But if the stream is not ordered (in that version of the library), then the result might become mangled due to the parallel processing. But how can I guard against this, other than not using parallel (which defeats the performance purpose)?Collections are explicit about being finite or infinite, about having an order or not, and they do not carry the processing mode or threadpools with them. Those seem like valuable properties for APIs.Additionally, Streams may sometimes need to be closed, but most commonly not. If I consume a stream from a method (of from a method parameter), should I generally call close?Also, streams might already have been consumed, and it would be good to be able to handle that case gracefully, so it would be good to check if the stream has already been consumed;I would wish for some code snippet that can be used to validate assumptions about a stream before processing it, like> <code>  public interface CoordinateServer { public Stream<Integer> coordinates(); // example implementations: // finite, ordered, sequential // IntStream.range(0, 100).boxed() // final AtomicInteger atomic = new AtomicInteger(); // // infinite, unordered, sequential // Stream.generate(() -> atomic2.incrementAndGet()) // infinite, unordered, parallel // Stream.generate(() -> atomic2.incrementAndGet()).parallel() // finite, ordered, sequential, should-be-closed // Files.lines(Path.path(""coordinates.txt"")).map(Integer::parseInt)} // if stream is parallel, which order will be written to file?coordinates().peek(i -> {writeToFile(i)}).count();// how should I remember to always add sequential() in such cases? coordinates().sorted().limit(1000).collect(toList()); // will this terminate?coordinates().allMatch(x -> x > 0); // will this terminate? // will result list maintain the same order as sequential?coordinates().map(i -> complexLookup(i)).parallel().collect(toList()); Stream<X> stream = fooLibrary.getStream();Stream<X> safeStream = StreamPreconditions( stream, /*maxThreshold or elements before IllegalArgumentException*/ 10_000, /* fail with IllegalArgumentException if not ordered */ true )",How to safely consume Java Streams safely without isFinite() and isOrdered() methods?

If send was successfull - update field status with value 'success' We have to have a sheduled job which have to check rows with pending status. At the moment 2 cases are possible:3.1 Notification wasn't send at all3.2 Notification was send but save into database was failed(probability is very low but it is possible) So we have to distinquish that 2 cases somehow: we may store messages from topic in the collection and job can check if the message was accepted or not. So if job found a message which corresponds the database row we have to update status to ""success"".

Java: return 2 counted values from one function," I want to create a function which returns two counted values. The values are counted by iterating over a for-loop.For example, I have an array of persons (male, female, adults, children) and I only want to find the amount of boys (child + male) and the amount of women (adult + female).In the last few years I've been writing in javascript and this is how I would have done it in javascript. Now my problem is, how do I return such an object in java? Do I need to create a new class? What would you call that class?Isn't that extremely inefficient, having a complete class only for this one small purpose? What if I wanted to count a different pair of values? Would I have to create another entirely new class?Is this below actually the best way of creating such a function? Of course, another option would be to seperate the function into the functions ""countBoys()"" and ""countWomen()"" but then I'd have to iterate over the array twice and that wouldn't be optimal right? <code>  function countBoysAndWomen() { var womenCounter = 0; var boysCounter = 0; for (var p of persons) { if (p.isAdult() && p.isFemale()) womenCounter++; else if (p.isChild() && p.isMale()) boysCounter++; } return {amountOfWomen: womenCounter, amountOfBoys: boysCounter};} private Counter countBoysAndWomen() { Counter counter = new Counter(); for (Person p:persons) { if (p.isBoy()) counter.addBoy(); else if (p.isWomen()) counter.addWoman(); } return counter;}",Return 2 counted values from one function

How to typecast an object in the java Stream API," How can I typecast an object inside the nested list's Object -: As the code mentioned above, Following is the descriptions-:List<expenseLineItemList> is the master List for which I am invoking the stream API, then I am streaming on the List<Controls>.Now, the data getObject() in the Controls class is the type of Object which I am trying to typecast here. As the map function map(GenericScreenDataBean.class::cast) will cast the Controls.class, I am getting the typecasting exception.So, instead of typecasting the Controls.class, how can I typecast the getControls().getObject() and filter out the desired result? <code>  C c = GenericScreenDataBean fieldObjx = this.expenseLineItemList.stream() .flatMap(a -> a.getSectionModel().getControls().stream()) .filter(b -> b.getData() instanceof GenericScreenDataBean) .map(GenericScreenDataBean.class::cast) .filter(c->c.getFieldKey().equals(""IncurredAmount"")).findAny().orElse(null);",How to typecast an object in the java Stream API?

Why java uses of instead new for dates," In the new date package in Java 8, we changed from using ""new Date()"" to ""LocalDate.of()"". When you want a new object you usually use the new keyword. This is an intuitive way to create a new object.Sometimes, when you need a singleton with delayed initialization you can use a static method to get the instance. In this case you must call it getInstance() so developers know what to expect. This new syntax makes the code less intuitive.

Is there a way to append a new product object directly into the factory document without reading the whole object?EDIT:As for the comments, I tried : This gives error : So I modified to convert it to a string before push : This pushed object correctly but when reading : Still, I got nowhere here.

Is the writer's reason correct for for using thenCompose and not thenComposeAsync," This question is different from this one Difference between Java8 thenCompose and thenComposeAsync because I want to know what is the writer's reason for using thenCompose and not thenComposeAsync.I was reading Modern Java in action and I came across this part of code on page 405: Everything is Ok and I can understand this code but here is the writer's reason for why he didn't use thenComposeAsync on page 408 which I can't understand:In general, a method without the Async suffix in its name executesits task in the same threads the previous task, whereas a methodterminating with Async always submits the succeeding task to thethread pool, so each of the tasks can be handled by adifferent thread. In this case, the result of the secondCompletableFuture depends on the first,so it makes no difference tothe final result or to its broad-brush timing whether you compose thetwo CompletableFutures with one or the other variant of this methodIn my understanding with the thenCompose( and thenComposeAsync) signatures as below: The result of the second CompletableFuture can depends on the previous CompletableFuture in many situations(or rather I can say almost always), should we use thenCompose and not thenComposeAsync in those cases?What if we have blocking code in the second CompletableFuture?This is a similar example which was given by person who answered similar question here: Difference between Java8 thenCompose and thenComposeAsync To my mind in this situation using thenComposeAsync can make our program faster because here blockingRequestForQuote can be run on different thread. But based on the writer's opinion we should not use thenComposeAsync because it depends on the first CompletableFuture result(that is Quote).My question is:Is the writer's idea correct when he said :In this case, the result of the secondCompletableFuture depends on the first,so it makes no difference tothe final result or to its broad-brush timing whether you compose thetwo CompletableFutures with one or the other variant of this method <code>  public static List<String> findPrices(String product) { ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); List<Shop> shops = Arrays.asList(new Shop(), new Shop()); List<CompletableFuture<String>> priceFutures = shops.stream() .map(shop -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> shop.getPrice(product), executor)) .map(future -> future.thenApply(Quote::parse)) .map(future -> future.thenCompose(quote -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> Discount.applyDiscount(quote), executor))) .collect(toList()); return priceFutures.stream() .map(CompletableFuture::join).collect(toList());} public <U> CompletableFuture<U> thenCompose( Function<? super T, ? extends CompletionStage<U>> fn) { return uniComposeStage(null, fn);}public <U> CompletableFuture<U> thenComposeAsync( Function<? super T, ? extends CompletionStage<U>> fn) { return uniComposeStage(asyncPool, fn);} public CompletableFuture<String> requestData(Quote quote) { Request request = blockingRequestForQuote(quote); return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> sendRequest(request));}",Is the writer's reason correct for using thenCompose and not thenComposeAsync
Aretmis logs - java heap memory full with persistence enabled," With persistence enabled in broker.xml and when -Xms & -Xmx are set to 4GB and global-max-size set to default 200Mb (most of the setting were just created by the Artemis create command) I am getting the below exceptions either within a day or three based on the rate of data processed. Configuration is similar to this post. I was able to confirm the heap was 100%. Using Artemis version 2.13.0. VM is a 2 core Linux machine with 7 GB RAM. I had disabled the persistence. Also another observation is the RES size is growing gradually when I use the top command.Client configuration: (using camel and activeMq JMS component) I was not able to get the heapdump, but there was a hs_err_pid file generated. Update:Not able to get the heap dump, as the broker instance hangs after logging the below message in logs With the persistence flag as false in broker.xml, the heap issue occurred only once. (as mentioned the logs above)Enabling artemis.profile to log oom_heapdump.hprof didn't log any info but exception with Thread dump info.The below message is also noticed frequently in the logs. The clients (consumer) uses OPENWIRE using activemq-5.13 client jar. From the broker console, the producer use CORE protocol.Jvisual VM for Broker running straight 20 hrsI enabled the JAVA_ARGS to print the OOM trace a 7 GB file got generated, below is the analysis using Eclipse MAT tool.1.2G shallow heap consumption by org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.paging.cursor.impl.PagePosistionImpl.From the Docs, when address-full-policy is set to PAGE that is the time broker starts appending to page.

Stream internals," I am trying to understand internal calls of Stream API of Java.I have the following code, which has two filter (intermediate) operations and one terminal operation. Stream - > returns Stream with overridden filter - > returns Stream with overridden filter - > terminalI see that for each intermediate operation a new stream is returned with overridden filter method. Once it hits the terminal method, the stream executes the filter. I see that filter() is being run twice if there are two filter operations instead of once.I want to understand how one stream traversal is able to call filter twice.Pasting the IntPipeline code below which is hit for the filter method in Stream. The filter() returns a new Stream whose predicate is set as e%2==0 and then again a new Stream is returned whose predicate is e==2. Once the terminal operation is hit the, for each traversal the predicates code is executed then at line 11.Edit : I see that downstream is used to link the intermediate ops as a LinkedList. So all the implementations are added to the linkedlist as previous stage and called once traversal starts? <code>  IntStream.of(1,2,3) .filter(e->e%2==0) .filter(e->e==2) .forEach(e->System.out.println(e)); @Overridepublic final IntStream filter(IntPredicate predicate) { Objects.requireNonNull(predicate); return new StatelessOp<Integer>(this, StreamShape.INT_VALUE, StreamOpFlag.NOT_SIZED) { @Override Sink<Integer> opWrapSink(int flags, Sink<Integer> sink) { return new Sink.ChainedInt<Integer>(sink) { @Override public void begin(long size) { downstream.begin(-1); } @Override public void accept(int t) { if (predicate.test(t)) ///line 11 downstream.accept(t); } }; } };}",Stream multiple filter internals
Why is the Set interface returning an ordered list?," Output: By definition on the tutorials point pageA Set is a generic set of values with no duplicate elements. A TreeSet is a set where the elements are sorted.Why is the output for both s and s1 sorted?

Automatically replacing with var," I'm migrating some pre Java 10 code and I'm wondering if IntelliJ offers a way to automatically refactor the code to replace the variable declarations that uses the actual type with var wherever it's possible.The code is full of stuff like: And I would prefer: I already looked in IntelliJ's settings (Code Style/Inspections) and couldn't find anything. <code>  String status = ""empty"";BigDecimal interest = BigDecimal.ZERO;List<Future<Boolean>> results = es.invokeAll(tasks);LocalDate start = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1); var status = ""empty"";var interest = BigDecimal.ZERO;var results = es.invokeAll(tasks);var start = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1);",Automatically replacing with var using IntelliJ

Double precession is different in different languages," I'm experimenting with the precision of a double value in various programming languages.My programsmain.c main.cpp main.py Main.java The outputmain.c main.cpp main.py Main.java My questionI know that there are some errors in the double type itself about which we can learn more from blogs like Why You Should Never Use Float and Double for Monetary Calculations and What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic.But these errors are not random! Every time the errors are the same, thus my question is why are these different for different programming languages?Secondly, why are the precision errors in Java and Python same? [Java's JVM is written in C++ whereas the python interpreter is written in C]But surprisingly their errors are same, but different from the errors in C and C++.

CompletableFuture Java 8 vs Java 11," Why does this block of code behave differently in Java 8 vs Java 11? I expected it to print Finish and then for numbers from 1 to 20 with a 500 ms interval print that number, and then stop execution, and it works correctly in Java 8.When I run exactly the same method on Java 11, however, it printed Finish and terminated without invoking the runAsync(...) code. I managed to start it by adding an ExecutorService like this And now it gets executed, but doesn't finish; it gets to 10 and after that just sits without finishing. I figured out how to stop execution by invoking executorService.shutdown(); right before return, but I am 100% sure that this approach is wrong, because usually I will have the same executorService for many methods, and if I shut it down other methods will also fail to execute.What changed between Java 8 and Java 11 here, and why do I now have to add an explicit executor service, and most importantly how can I finish the method execution properly? <code>  private static String test2() { CompletableFuture .runAsync(() -> IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 20).forEach(x -> { try { Thread.sleep(500); System.out.println(x); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } })); return ""Finish"";} private static String test2() { final ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); CompletableFuture .runAsync(() -> IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 10).forEach(x -> { try { Thread.sleep(500); System.out.println(x); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }), executorService); return ""Finish"";}",Why does my CompletableFuture code run in Java 8 but not in Java 11?

If not, are there some improvements that can help in my logic (maybe an efficient multithreading approach)? <code>  10101011010100 10011000101101 = 10101011010100 10011000101101 --------------10001000000100 21302032 31012233 = 2130203231012233 --------11003021 21302032 = 1001110010001110 in binary31012233 = 1101000110101111 in binary11003021 = 0101000011001001 in binary10011100100011101101000110101111 ----------------0101000011001001 public class Multiplication { public static void main(String[] args) { final byte[][] MUL_ARRAY = new byte[][]{ {0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 2, 3}, {0, 2, 3, 1}, {0, 3, 1, 2} }; long mask; byte shift = 2; //long is 64 bits which means it can store 32 digits quaternary value. int n = 8; //# of quaternary digits (ALWAYS given) long v1 = 0b1001110010001110;//21302012 in base 4 long v2 = 0b1101000110101111;//31012233 in base 4 long result = 0; for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { //get far-right quaternary digit of the two vectors: mask = 0b11; mask = mask << 2 * (n - i - 1); long v1DigitPadded = v1 & mask;//correct digit with zero padding long v2DigitPadded = v2 & mask;//correct digit with zero padding //shift the digits so that the digit needed is at far-right v1DigitPadded = v1DigitPadded >>> 2 * (n - i - 1); v2DigitPadded = v2DigitPadded >>> 2 * (n - i - 1); //The actual quaternary digit byte v1Digit = (byte) v1DigitPadded; byte v2Digit = (byte) v2DigitPadded; byte product = MUL_ARRAY[v1Digit][v2Digit]; long resultDigit = product << 2 * (n - i - 1); result = result | resultDigit; } //desired output: 0101000011001001 //prints the value in binary with zeros padding on the left String s = Long.toBinaryString(result); String output = String.format(""%"" + n * 2 + ""s"", s).replace("" "", ""0""); System.out.println(""The output is: "" + output); }}",Constant time for multiplication in Galois Field GF(4)
Java - May I query lambda function lifetime at runtime?," I know the Java compiler generates different classes for lambda functions depending on the context and closure they have. When I receive the lambda as a parameter (using the Consumer<> class), may I know the lifetime of the parameter?For example, I have the following Observable class, that keeps a weak reference to its observes. Now I use it as follows. The code just creates the object and its observer and creates ContainingClass (definition follows) that observes. Then the object is set once, garbage collector explicitly called (so the created ContainingClass is deleted) and set the object a second time.Now, as long as the lambda is instance-specific (reference either this or its instances method) it's called only once (because it is destroyed by the GC). But as the lambda becomes static, it is called twice, even after GC. The reference to this lambda is never destroyed and therefore add as an observer every time ContainingClass instance is created. As a result, it will be stuck in observers until the program ends.Is there a way to detect this and at least show a warning, that the lambda will be never removed?One thing I figured out is that lambda with instance lifetime has arg$1 property, so I can ask about the number of properties. Is it a universal approach? May there be a situation when this doesn't work? <code>  class Observable { private final List<WeakReference<Consumer<Object>>> observables = new ArrayList<>(); private Object obj; public Observable(Object obj){ this.obj = obj; } public void observe(Consumer<Object> cons){ this.observables.add(new WeakReference<>(cons)); } public void set(Object obj){ this.obj = obj; // notify observes for(WeakReference<Consumer<Object>> cons : this.observables){ if(cons.get() != null) cons.get().accept(this.obj); // clearing the non-existing observes from the list is ommited for simplicity } }} public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Object c = new Object(); Observable obs = new Observable(c); new ContainingClass(obs); obs.set(c); System.gc(); obs.set(c); }} public class ContainingClass { public ContainingClass(Observable obs){ obs.observe(this::myMethod); } private void myMethod(Object obj) { System.out.println(""Hello here""); }} public class ContainingClass { private Object obj; public ContainingClass(Observable obs){ obs.observe(obj -> { this.obj = obj; System.out.println(""Hello here""); }); }} public class ContainingClass { public ContainingClass(Observable obs){ obs.observe((obj) -> System.out.println(""Hello here"")); }} public void observe(Consumer<Object> cons){ if(cons.getClass().getDeclaredFields().length == 0) System.out.println(""It is static lifetime lambda""); this.observables.add(new WeakReference<>(cons));}",May I query lambda function lifetime at runtime?
using conditional operator for long if statement in java," I am seeing if there is a better/nicer way of writing a long if statement using multiple || operators.After looking online I see a lot of examples using conditional binomial operator. Is there a way this can be used when checking if a string equals a word?The examples online follow this structure: Here is the function: The function checks to see the parameter word matches one of the following.Is there a nicer or more efficient way I could write it? <code>  int price = condition?80:100; public boolean validateLetters(String word) { if (word.equals(""apple"") || word.equals(""excel"") || word.equals(""intern"") || word.equals(""orange"") || word.equals(""car"")) { return true; } return false; }",Using conditional operator for long if statement
java: Is it safe to use !=/== with Character?," Is it safe to use ==/!= while comparing Character?Character being a boxed type is it safe to use ==/!= while comparing Character types? The following works as expected (true). However, are there cases where comparing Character with same value using == would lead to false? (Hence, do we have to use '.equals()' while comparing boxed primitive types? <code>  public static void main(String[] args) { Character c1 = 'd'; Character c2 = (char) getInt(); System.out.println(c1 == c2); } public static int getInt() { return 100; }",Is it safe to use !=/== with Character?

Setting up JAVA_HOME in Ubuntu," I tried to run Kafka on CMD in Windows and it's very unstable , constantly giving errors. Then I came across this post, which suggests installing Ubuntu and run Kafka from there.I have installed Ubuntu successfully. Given that I have already defined JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_231 as one of the environmental variables and CMD recognizes this variable but Ubuntu does not, I am wondering how to make Ubuntu recognize this because at the moment, when i typed java -version, Ubuntu returns command not found.Update: Please note that I have to have Ubuntu's JAVA_HOME pointing to the evironmental variable JAVA_HOME defined in my Window system. Because my Java program in eclipse would need to talk to Kafka using the same JVM.I have added the two lines below in my /etc/profile file. echo $JAVA_HOME returns the correct path. However, java -version returns a different version of Java installed on Ubuntu, not the one defined in the /etc/profile <code>  export JAVA_HOME=mnt/c/Program\ Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_231export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH",Setting up JAVA_HOME in Ubuntu to point to Window's JAVA_HOME
