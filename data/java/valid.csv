insert/replace XML tag in XmlDocument," I have a XmlDocument in java, created with the Weblogic XmlDocument parser.I want to replace the content of a tag in this XMLDocument with my own data, or insert the tag if it isn't there. For example I want to insert a URL in the location tag: but otherwise leave the XML as is.Currently I use a XMLCursor: I tried to find a ""quick"" xquery way to do this since the XmlDocument has an execQuery method, but didn't find it very easy. Do anyone have a better way than this? It seems a bit elaborate. <code>  <customdata> <tag1 /> <tag2>mfkdslmlfkm</tag2> <location /> <tag3 /></customdata> <location>http://something</location> XmlObject xmlobj = XmlObject.Factory.parse(a.getCustomData(), options); XmlCursor xmlcur = xmlobj.newCursor(); while (xmlcur.hasNextToken()) { boolean found = false; if (xmlcur.isStart() && ""schema-location"".equals(xmlcur.getName().toString())) { xmlcur.setTextValue(""http://replaced""); System.out.println(""replaced""); found = true; } else if (xmlcur.isStart() && ""customdata"".equals(xmlcur.getName().toString())) { xmlcur.push(); } else if (xmlcur.isEnddoc()) { if (!found) { xmlcur.pop(); xmlcur.toEndToken(); xmlcur.insertElementWithText(""schema-location"", ""http://inserted""); System.out.println(""inserted""); } } xmlcur.toNextToken(); }",How to insert/replace XML tag in XmlDocument?

Is it possible to make an eclipse p2 provisionning mechanism running *locally* ?," Eclipse 3.4[.x] - also known as Ganymede - comes with this new mechanism of provisioning called p2.""Provisioning"" is the process allowing to discover and update on demand some parts of an application, as explained in general in this article on the Sun Web site.Eclipse has an extended wiki section in which p2 details are presented. Specifically, it says in this wiki page that p2 will look for new componentsHowever after reading it.I suppose (but you may confirm that point by your own experience), that p2 can function file ""file://"" protocol, which would allow it to provision with local file (either on your computer or on an UNC path '\server\path'), as illustrated here, but also by the files:[eclipse-SDK-3.4-win32]\eclipse\configuration\.settings\org.eclipse.equinox.p2.artifact.repository.prefs[eclipse-SDK-3.4-win32]\eclipse\configuration\.settings\org.eclipse.equinox.p2.metadata.repository.prefsp2 mechanism is used to update eclipse itself, through an eclipse 3.4 update site, and reference in those '.prefs' files with line like: repositories/file:_C:_jv_eclipse_eclipse-SDK-3.4-win32_eclipse/url=file:/C:/jv/eclipse/eclipse-SDK-3.4-win32/eclipse/Now, how could I replicate the eclipse components present in that update site into a local directory and reference those components through the mentioned '.prefs' files, in order to have an upgrade process entirely run locally, without having to access the web?I suppose that some p2 metadata files present in the distant 'update site' need to be replicated and changed as well.Do you have any thoughts/advice/tips on that ?

Java: Collections.emptyList() returns a List<Object>?," I'm having some trouble navigating Java's rule for inferring generic type parameters. Consider the following class, which has an optional list parameter: My Java compiler gives the following error: But Collections.emptyList() returns type <T> List<T>, not List<Object>.

In this example, the final code example is satisfactory, but with larger classes, I'd like to be able to write methods following this ""optional parameter"" pattern without duplicating code.For extra credit: when is it appropriate to use EMPTY_LIST as opposed to emptyList()? <code>  import java.util.Collections;import java.util.List;public class Person { private String name; private List<String> nicknames; public Person(String name) { this(name, Collections.emptyList()); } public Person(String name, List<String> nicknames) { this.name = name; this.nicknames = nicknames; }} Person.java:9: The constructor Person(String, List<Object>) is undefined public Person(String name) { this(name,(List<String>)Collections.emptyList());} Person.java:9: inconvertible types public Person(String name) { this(name, Collections.EMPTY_LIST);} Person.java:9: warning: [unchecked] unchecked conversion public Person(String name) { this.name = name; this.nicknames = Collections.emptyList();}",Collections.emptyList() returns a List<Object>?

"Reversing a Linked List in Java, recursively"," I have been working on a Java project for a class for a while now. It is an implementation of a linked list (here called AddressList, containing simple nodes called ListNode). The catch is that everything would have to be done with recursive algorithms. I was able to do everything fine sans one method: public AddressList reverse() ListNode: Right now my reverse function just calls a helper function that takes an argument to allow recursion. With my helper function having the signature of private ListNode reverse(ListNode current).At the moment, I have it working iteratively using a stack, but this is not what the specification requires. I had found an algorithm in C that recursively reversed and converted it to Java code by hand, and it worked, but I had no understanding of it.Edit: Nevermind, I figured it out in the meantime. While I'm here, does anyone see any problems with this route? <code>  public class ListNode{ public String data; public ListNode next;} public AddressList reverse(){ return new AddressList(this.reverse(this.head));} private AddressList reverse(ListNode current, AddressList reversedList){ if(current == null) return reversedList; reversedList.addToFront(current.getData()); return this.reverse(current.getNext(), reversedList);}","Reversing a linked list in Java, recursively"

In this program both MainMode and TestMode are sub-classes of the abstract class Game.Now I want to replace this line with a Factory Pattern, although I am unsure as my TestMode constructor requires an extra object and I am unsure where I would need to pass this value. If I were going to create a Factory it'd need to be in a new class, probably named GameFactory or ModeFactory or something along those lines.How would I go about this?EDIT: The problem here is that the code above is in my GUI, where the values for numberRanges, numberOfGuesses and the randNo() method are. I want to create a Factory class but I am unable to pass these values through because randNo() activates itself. Here is my randNo() method. The problem is that whenever I pass randNo() it displays the JOptionPane. As I've said already the GUI and Logic is separate. The GUI is in a GUI package whilst the rest of the code is in the logic package. <code>  play = (isMode) ? new MainMode(numberRanges, numberOfGuesses) : new TestMode(numberRanges, numberOfGuesses, randNo()); private int randNo() { boolean isValidNumber = true; int testRandomNum = 0; while(isValidNumber) { try { testRandomNum = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog(""Enter Random Number"")); isValidNumber = false; } catch (NumberFormatException e) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, ""Sorry, but the number you entered was invalid""); } } return testRandomNum;}",Best way to implement the Factory Pattern in Java
Using Spring IoC to  set up enum values," Is there a way to set up such enum values via Spring IoC at construction time?What I would like to do is to inject, at class load time, values that are hard-coded in the code snippet below: Let's say that the application must be deployed in Germany, where Nanos are ""Nearly free"", or in India where Ferraris are ""Unaffordable"". In both countries, there are only three cars (deterministic set), no more no less, hence an enum, but their ""inner"" values may differ. So, this is a case of contextual initialization of immutables. <code>  public enum Car{ NANO (""Very Cheap"", ""India""), MERCEDES (""Expensive"", ""Germany""), FERRARI (""Very Expensive"", ""Italy""); public final String cost; public final String madeIn; Car(String cost, String madeIn) { this.cost= cost; this.madeIn= madeIn; }}",Using Spring IoC to set up enum values

getters/setters in java," I'm new to Java, but have some OOP experience with ActionScript 3, so I'm trying to migrate relying on stuff I know.In ActionScript 3 you can create getters and setters using the get and set keywords, meaning you create a method in the class and access data through a property of an instance of that class.

Need a way to scale a font to fit a rectangle.," I just wrote some code to scale a font to fit within (the length of) a rectangle. It starts at 18 width and iterates down until it fits.This seems horribly inefficient, but I can't find a non-looping way to do it.This line is for labels in a game grid that scales, so I can't see a work-around solution (wrapping, cutting off and extending past the rectangle are all unacceptable). It's actually pretty quick, I'm doing this for hundreds of rectangles and it's fast enough to just slow it down a touch.If nobody comes up with anything better, I'll just load the starting guess from a table (so that it's much closer than 18) and use this--except for the lag it works great. <code>  public Font scaleFont(String text, Rectangle rect, Graphics g, Font pFont) { float nextTry=18.0f; Font font=pFont; while(x > 4) { font=g.getFont().deriveFont(nextTry); FontMetrics fm=g.getFontMetrics(font); int width=fm.stringWidth(text); if(width <= rect.width) return font; nextTry*=.9; } return font;}",Need a way to scale a font to fit a rectangle

I'm sure it's not the most efficient way to achieve this behavior so I'm totally open for criticism of my programming skills in the comments, but here my problem: When I make I character jump, what I do is that I put his dy to a negative value, say -200 and I set the boolean jumping to true, that makes the character go up, and then I have this function called checkGravity() that ensure that everything that goes up has to go down, checkGravity also checks for the character being over platforms so I will strip it down a little for the sake of your time: So, the problem is, that this function updates the dy regardless of the diff, making the characters fly like Superman in slow machines, and I have no idea how to implement the diff factor so that when a character is jumping, his speed decrement in a proportional way to the game speed.

In addition, we've restricted deploy access and automated build/deployment of snapshot artifacts through a Hudson CI server. Hudson can analyze all of the upstream/downstream project dependencies, so if a compilation problem, test failure, or some other violation causes the build to break, no deployment will occur. Be weary of doing snapshot deployments in Maven2/Maven3, as the metadata has changed between the two versions. The ""Hudson only"" snapshot deployment strategy will mitigate this.

Java: Comparing two string arrays and removing elements that exist in both arrays.," This is mainly a performance questions. I have a master list of all users existing in a String array AllUids. I also have a list of all end dated users existing in a String array EndUids.I am working in Java and my goal is to remove any users that exist in the end dated array from the master list AllUids. I know PHP has a function called array_diff.I was curious if Java has anything that will compare two arrays and remove elements that are similar in both. My objective is performance here which is why I asked about a built in function. I do not want to add any special packages. I thought about writing a recursive function but it just seems like it will be inefficient. There are thousands of users in both lists. In order to exist in the end dated list, you must exist in the AllUids list, that is until removed.Example: Functionality I am looking for: ActiveUids would look like this: Thank you all,Obviously I can come up with loops and such but I am not confident that it will be efficient.

I've had an issue for a week and a half, where threads implementing various 3rd party source code keep colliding due to static variables and other such things that are really beyond my control. I know a single system can run as many instances of the project I'm working on, as it wants. But when trying to incorporate everything into a threaded, single executable, there are always errors and exceptions.I'm almost at the point of just launching a new process for each instance of this program that I want, but I'd really rather not go down this route (it would eliminate a lot of real-time data I gather, as well as hinder my ability to kill a targeted process).Suggestions? Thanks! <code> ",Thread isolation in Java

Design of a Fluent Interface for Regular Expressions," I've just seen a huge regex for Java that made me think a little about maintainability of regular expressions in general. I believe that most people - except some badass perl mongers - would agree that regular expressions are hardly maintainable.I was thinking about how this situation could be fixed. So far, the most promising idea I have is using a fluent interface. To give an example, instead of: one could write something like this In this very short example, the common way of creating regular expression is still quite readable to any mediocre talented developer. However, think about those spooky expressions that fill two or more lines with 80 characters each. Sure, the (verbose) fluent interface would require several lines instead of only two, but I'm sure it would be much more readable (hence maintainable).Now my questions: Do you know of any similar approach to regular expressions?Do you agree that this approach could be better than using simple strings?How would you design the API?Would you use such a neat utility in your projects?Do you think this would be fun implementing? ;)EDIT:Imagine that there could be methods that are on a higher level than simple constructs we all no from regex, e.g. EDIT - short summary of comments:a fluent regexps library for .NETRegexBuddy - spend 30 EUR to make your code readable (wtf?! the pure existence of such a product proves my thesis right - regular expressions as we know them today are a Bad Thing (tm)) Martin Fowler's approach (which still is far from being perfect)It's interesting to read that most people think that regular expressions are here to stay - although it takes tools to read them and smart guys to think of ways to make them maintainable. While I'm not sure that a fluent interface is the best way to go, I'm sure that some smart engineers - we? ;) - should spend some time to make regular expressions a thing of the past - it's enough that they've been with us for 50 years know, don't you think?OPEN BOUNTYThe bounty will be awarded to the best idea (no code required) for a new approach to regular expressions.EDIT - A NICE EXAMPLE:here's the kind of pattern I'm talking about - extra kudos to the first one who's able to translate it - RegexBuddies allowed (it's from an Apache project btw) extra kudos awarded to chii and mez: it's a RFC compliant email address validation pattern - although its RFC822 (see ex-parrot.com), not 5322 - not sure if there is a difference though - if yes, I'll award next extra kudos for a

what are first-class objects in Java and C#? ," When I started OO programming many years ago I gained the impression that variables (if that is the right word) were either ""primitives"" (int, double, etc.) or first-class objects (String, JPane, etc.).

Embedding an AppUserModelID in Java," I use Launch4j as a wrapper for my Java application under Windows 7, which, to my understanding, in essence forks an instance of javaw.exe that in turn interprets the Java code. As a result, when attempting to pin my application to the task bar, Windows instead pins javaw.exe. Without the required command line, my application will then not run.As you can see, Windows also does not realize that Java is the host application: the application itself is described as ""Java(TM) Platform SE binary"".I have tried altering the registry key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\javaw.exe to add the value IsHostApp. This alters the behavior by disabling pinning of my application altogether; clearly not what I want.After reading about how Windows interprets instances of a single application (and a phenomenon discussed in this question), I became interested in embedding a Application User Model ID (AppUserModelID) into my Java application.I believe that I can resolve this by passing a unique AppUserModelID to Windows. There is a shell32 method for this, SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID. Following Gregory Pakosz suggestion, I implemented it in an attempt to have my application recognized as a separate instance of javaw.exe: This appears to have no effect, but the function returns without error. Diagnosing why is something of a mystery to me. Any suggestions?Working implementationThe final implementation that worked is the answer to my follow-up question concerning how to pass the AppID using JNA.I had awarded the bounty to Gregory Pakosz' brilliant answer for JNI that set me on the right track.For reference, I believe using this technique opens the possibility of using any of the APIs discussed in this article in a Java application. <code>  NativeLibrary lib;try { lib = NativeLibrary.getInstance(""shell32"");} catch (Error e) { Logger.out.error(""Could not load Shell32 library.""); return;}Object[] args = { ""Vendor.MyJavaApplication"" };String functionName = ""SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID"";try { Function function = lib.getFunction(functionName); int ret = function.invokeInt(args); if (ret != 0) { Logger.out.error(function.getName() + "" returned error code "" + ret + "".""); }} catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) { Logger.out.error(functionName + "" was not found in "" + lib.getFile().getName() + "".""); // Function not supported}",Pinning a Java application to the Windows 7 taskbar

Urgent swing question / JTree / custom tree model," I'm having a problem and hope, someone knows what's going wrong and why and is able to give me the explanation of what I'm missing out right now to make that thing work as suggested.I have a JTree which is build upon a custom TreeModel (""WRTreeModel"", see below).The data structure this model shall be used for is build of an root object which contains some fields and furthermore a list which is backed by the ""ArrayListModel"" shown below.The tree looks fine when I build it using the WRTreeModel. I'm able to expand and collapse the nodes which represent the lists and fields contained in the objects.I can expand and collapse these lists and see their contents as well and so on.Now I want to remove a child of one of the lists and - as I already know - do it by removing it from the model calling the remove method of the ArrayListModel.To make the WRTreeModel aware of that remove, the first thing is to call its fireIntervalRemoved method is called, so far so good.In the WRTreeModels inner class ArrayModelListener the intervalRemoved method prepares the call of fireTreeNodesRemoved which then builds a TreeEvent which is forwarded to all registeredTreeModelListeners (and therefore the JTree which registers itself automaticall when it's connected to the model).Now I would expect that the tree reflects the change and updates it's internal and visual representation to show the new state.Unfortunately this doesn't seem to work that way. Something happens. But when I click on the node I just have changed some EventHandler-Exceptions are thrown.Obviously something got really confused.I know it's not easy to answer such a question on the fly but I would really appreciate a fast answer.It would also be of help, if someone knew websites explaining the use of custom tree models (not on DefaultMutableTreeNode or any given implementation based class) and how the event handling and updating of the JTree works.With best regards,Thomas Arts  <code>  public class ArrayListModel<E> extends ArrayList<E> implements ListModel {...public E remove(int index) { fireIntervalRemoved(index, index);

Strategies for concurrent pipes in Java," Consider the following shell script: This has three processes working in parallel to decompress a stream, modify it, and re-compress it. Running time I can see my user time is about twice that of my real time, which indicates the program is effectively working in parallel. I've attempted to create the same program in Java by placing each task in it's own thread. Unfortunately, the multithreaded Java program is only about 30% faster than the single threaded version for the above sample. I've tried using both an Exchanger and a ConcurrentLinkedQueue. The ConcurrentLinkedQueue linked queue causes a lot of contention, although all three threads are generally kept busy. The Exchanger has lower contention, but is more complicated, and the doesn't seem to keep the slowest worker running 100% of the time. I'm trying to figure out a pure Java solution to this problem without looking at one of the byte code weaving frameworks or a JNI based MPI. Most of the concurrency research and APIs concern themselves with divide-and-conquer algorithms, giving each node work which is orthogonal and non-dependent on prior calculations. Another approach to concurrency is the pipeline approach, where each worker does some work and passes the data onto the next worker. I'm not trying to find the most efficient way to sed a gzip'd file, but rather I'm looking at how to efficiently break down tasks in a pipeline, in order to reduce the runtime to that of the slowest task.Current timings for a 10m line file are as follows: I'm offering a bounty for a 10% improvement in Java, as measured by real time on a four core system with 10m rows of test data.

How to synchronize a static variable among threads running different instances of a class in java?," I know that using the synchronize keyword before a method brings synchronization to that object. That is, 2 threads running the same instance of the object will be synchronized. However, since the synchronization is at the object level, 2 threads running different instances of the object will not be synchronized. If we have a static variable in a Java class that is called by the method, we would like it to be synchronized across instances of the class. The two instances are running in 2 different threads. Can we achieve synchronization in the following way? Is it true that since we have defined an object lock that is static and we are using the keyword synchronized for that lock, the static variable count is now synchronized across instances of class Test? <code>  public class Test { private static int count = 0; private static final Object lock= new Object(); public synchronized void foo() { synchronized(lock) { count++; } } }",How to synchronize a static variable among threads running different instances of a class in Java?

Is it safe to reuse javax.xml.ws.Service objects," I have JAX-WS style web service client that was auto-generated with the NetBeans IDE.The generated proxy factory (extends javax.xml.ws.Service) delegates proxy creation to the various Service.getPort methods. The application that I am maintaining instantiates the factory and obtains a proxy each time it calls the targetted service.Creating the new proxy factory instances repeatedly has been shown to be expensive, given that the WSDL documentation supplied to the factory constructor, an HTTP URI, is re-retrieved for each instantiation.We had success in improving the performance by caching the WSDL. But this has ugly maintenance and packaging implications for us.I would like to explore the suitability of caching the proxy factory itself. Is it safe, e.g., can two different client classes, executing on the same JVM and targetting the same web service, safely use the same factory to obtain distinct proxy objects (or a shared, reentrant one)?I've been unable to find guidance from either the JAX-WS specification nor the javax.xml.ws API documentation.

Is there anything RAD comparible to VCL?," After years in embedded programming, I have to develop a Windows app. I dug out my old C++ Builder and Delphi. These are great and the latest version costs over $1k, so I won't be going there.What I particularly like is the VCL (visual component library) which let's me code my own components and share them with others, plus the thousands of existing 3rd party components. I noticed that there is now also a RAD PHP from Borland too.I realize that MSVC, QT, NetBeans, etc are good enough IDEs for RAD, BUT does anything offer the ease of the Borland products for developing additional components - and does anything else have thousands to choose from?PC based? Cross-platform is good. Browser based? Free is always good ;-)I don't particularly care about the programming language. I went with Lazarus and am pretty happy with it. I can't just recompile my code and expect it to run, but it covers 90% of my existing Delphi code. I'd recommend giving it a whirl before spending $1k for Delphi <code> ",Is there anything RAD comparable to VCL?

How to change line thickness in iText? (iText is Java pdf framework)," I'm drawing images to pdf using Java framework iText. I need to draw lines of specified width. There is a method setLineWidth(float width) in class PdfContentByte that should change it. However no matter what value I pass as its parameter the lines drawn are always extra thin.There is following line in javadoc of setLineWidth: The line width specifies the thickness of the line used to stroke a path and is measured in user space units.I don't know what is ""space unit"". Everything else in iText seems to be measured in point(around 1/72 inch).

How do I write a J2EE/EJB Singleton?," A day ago my application was one EAR, containing one WAR, one EJB JAR, and a couple of utility JAR files. I had a POJO singleton class in one of those utility files, it worked, and all was well with the world: Then I created a second WAR and found out (the hard way) that each WAR has its own ClassLoader, so each WAR sees a different singleton, and things break down from there. This is not so good. So, I'm looking for a way to create a Java singleton object that will work across WARs (across ClassLoaders?). The @Singleton EJB annotation seemed pretty promising until I found that JBoss 5.1 doesn't seem to support that annotation (which was added as part of EJB 3.1). Did I miss something - can I use @Singleton with JBoss 5.1? Upgrading to JBoss AS 6 is not an option right now.Alternately, I'd be just as happy to not have to use EJB to implement my singleton. What else can I do to solve this problem? Basically, I need a semi-application-wide* hook into a whole bunch of other objects, like various cached data, and app config info. As a last resort, I've already considered merging my two WARs into one, but that would be pretty hellish.*Meaning: available basically anywhere above a certain layer; for now, mostly in my WARs - the View and Controller (in a loose sense).Edit: I should really be calling it Java EE rather than J2EE, shouldn't I?Edit 2: Many thanks again to @Yishai for all the help. After some trial-and-error it looks like I've figured out how to use a single ClassLoader across WARs under JBoss 5. I'm detailing this below for my own sake, and hopefully others will find this useful as well.N.B. this is rather different from doing this under JBoss 4 (see Yishai's answer or my links below).Instead of writing a jboss-web.xml for each WAR, and a jboss.xml for ear EJB-JAR, put a jboss-classloading.xml file in each WAR, in the same location as the DD (web.xml). The contents of jboss-classloading.xml should be: This follows from the JBoss CW here, whereas what (I think) works for JBoss 4.x is described here.

Accesing contents of res/raw programatically (Android)," I'm working on an app for Android with a few other people, and the primary content is specified by our designers as text files in a certain file format, which we then parse, process, and serve in the app. We're currently storing them in res/raw.This makes things great for the designers because when they want to add content, they simply add a file to res/raw. This is annoying as a developer, however, since we developers then need to add R.raw.the_new_file to an array in the code specifying which files to process at startup.Is there a way to access the resource ID's of res/raw programatically? Ideally when the application starts, we could make a call to see which files are in res/raw, process all of them, so we could eliminate the small overhead with matching up the contents of res/raw with that of our array in the code.The most promising path I've seen is getAssets from Resources, which would let me call list(String) on the AssetManager, but I've had trouble getting this to work, especially since you can't directly call ""res/raw"" as your filepath (or at least, it hasn't worked when I've tried.  <code> ",Accessing contents of res/raw programmatically (Android)

Question about cloning in Java," In Effective Java, the author states that: If a class implements Cloneable, Object's clone method returns a field-by-field copy of the object; otherwise it throws CloneNotSupportedException.What I'd like to know is what he means with field-by-field copy. Does it mean that if the class has X bytes in memory, it will just copy that piece of memory? If yes, then can I assume all value types of the original class will be copied to the new object? If what Object.clone() does is a field by field copy of the Point class, I'd say that I wouldn't need to explicitly copy fields x and y, being that the code shown above will be more than enough to make a clone of the Point class. That is, the following bit of code is redundant: Am I right? I know references of the cloned object will point automatically to where the original object's references pointed to, I'm just not sure what happens specifically with value types. If anyone could state clearly what Object.clone()'s algorithm specification is (in easy language) that'd be great. <code>  class Point implements Cloneable{ private int x; private int y; @Override public Point clone() { return (Point)super.clone(); }} @Overridepublic Point clone() { Point newObj = (Point)super.clone(); newObj.x = this.x; //redundant newObj.y = this.y; //redundant}",What is this field-by-field copy done by Object.clone()?

Passing binary blob through an Android content provider," I have a content provider that is custom to my set of Android applications, and one of the things it needs to expose is a small (20-30 KiB) byte array. The URI for these blobs looks like: where # is the row number; the resulting cursor has the standard _id column and a data column. I'm using a MatrixCursor in the provider's query() method: Later, in the application consuming the data, I do: However, data does not contain the contents of my original byte array; rather, it contains something like [B@435cc518, which looks more like the address of the array than the contents. I tried wrapping the byte array in an implementation of java.sql.Blob, figuring that it might be looking for that since the content provider subsystem was written to be easy to use with SQLite, but it didn't help.Has anyone gotten this to work? If the data was in the file system, there are methods in ContentProvider that I could use to provide a marshalled InputStream to the client, but the data I'm trying to send back lives as a resource in the content provider's APK. <code>  content://my.authority/blob/# byte[] byteData = getMyByteData();MatrixCursor mc = new MatrixCursor(COLUMNS);mc.addRow(new Object[] { id, byteData }); Cursor c = managedQuery(uri, null, null, null, null);c.moveToFirst();byte[] data = c.getBlob(c.getColumnIndexOrThrow(""data""));",Passing binary blob through a content provider

Why does the (Sun) JVM have a fixed upper limit for memory usage (-Xmx)?," In the spirit of question Java: Why does MaxPermSize exist?, I'd like to ask why the Oracle JVM uses a fixed upper limit for the size of its memory allocation pool.The default is 1/4 of your physical RAM (with upper & lower limit); as a consequence, if you have a memory-hungry application you have to manually change the limit (parameter -Xmx), or your app will perform poorly, possible even crash with an OutOfMemoryError.Why does this fixed limit even exist? Why does the JVM not allocate memory as needed, like native programs do on most operating systems?This would solve a whole class of common problems with Java software (just Google to see how many hints there are on the net on solving problems by setting -Xmx).Edit:Some answers point out that this will protect the rest of the system from a Java program with a run-away memory leak; without the limit this would bring the whole system down by exhausting all memory. This is true. However, it is equally true for any other program, and modern OSes already let you limit the maximum memory for a programm (Linux ulimit, Windows ""Job Objects""). So this does not really answer the question, which is ""Why does the JVM do it differently from most other programs / runtime environments?"". <code> ",Why does the (Oracle) JVM have a fixed upper limit for memory usage (-Xmx)?

Any known discusson of why string identifiers are used to access resource data," I'm working a project to replace a Resource Management system (QuickTime Resource Manager on Mac and Windows) that has been deprecated and I have been using the current model that Qt uses where data is retrieved from the resource file using a string key.For example, I may have an image in my resource file, ""HungryBear.png"" stored in my resource file. Qt, and my proposed system, would get it in a way depicted by the psuedocode: It is clear at that point what that image is, and where it can be found.In our current system, we use numbers. The problems with numbers is that one has to hunt down the resource file (there can be many) to find out what image (or resource) it is.An example of this: The first method is what I have seen in current systems that access resource file data. I've been told that C# and Java uses it, I know that they do for string key-value pairs, etc.However, a peer of mine has expressed concern about changing the current system of using these number IDs for the string ids that I'm proposing. There seem to be many benefits and they fix many of the issues we've had with the current system. I want to have supporting documentation that the proposed system is better and desirable, so my question is this:Do you know of any research or discussion that demonstrates that using a string identifier (hierarchical) in code is better than using an arbitrary number?NOTESI plan on using a zip file (possibly uncompressed) to contain the data files.We have a application-plugin environment. The application and each plugin can have its own resource files. Plugins may be able to access resource data in the application's resource file.Here are some requirements that have been considered and I believe met:Software Developers shall be able to uniquely identify resources.Software Developers shall be able to name resources with meaningful names.Resources shall be associated with the parts of the application that need them.Localizers shall be able to easily identify resource files that have changed.Localizers shall be able to use their own tools to modify resource files.Customers shall be alerted in the event that the functionality they are using relies on deprecated calls. <code>  image = GetImageResource(""BearPlugin/Images/HungryBear.png""); oldActiveResourceFile = GetActiveResourceFile(); // think of a stack of resource filesSetActiveResourceFile(""BearPlugin"");image = GetImageResource(1);// Perhaps other resources are retrieved and other functions called// Possibly introduce problems by calling functions that change ""Active Resource File""SetActiveResourceFile(oldActiveResourceFile);",Why are string identifiers used to access resource data?

Is asynchronous jdbc call possible ?," I wonder if there is a way to make asynchronous calls to a database?For instance, imagine that I've a big request that take a very long time to process, I want to send the request and receive a notification when the request will return a value (by passing a Listener/callback or something). I don't want to block waiting for the database to answer.I don't consider that using a pool of threads is a solution because it doesn't scale, in the case of heavy concurrent requests this will spawn a very large number of threads.We are facing this kind of problem with network servers and we have found solutions by using select/poll/epoll system call to avoid having one thread per connection. I'm just wondering how to have a similar feature with database request?Note:I'm aware that using a FixedThreadPool may be a good work-around, but I'm surprised that nobody has developed a system really asynchronous (without the usage of extra thread).** Update **Because of the lack of real practical solutions, I decided to create a library (part of finagle) myself: finagle-mysql. It basically decodes/decodes mysql request/response, and use Finagle/Netty under the hood. It scales extremely well even with huge number of connections. <code> ",Is asynchronous jdbc call possible?

Simulating dynamic objects in Java," The problem: I'd like to be able to generically access in Java any property/field on a Java ojbect similarly to how a dynamic language (think Groovy, JavaScript) would. I won't know at the time I'm writing this plumbing code what type of object it is or what the property/field name will be. But I will know the property/field name when I go to use it.My current solution: So far I've written a simple wrapper class that uses java.beans.Introspector to grab the properties of a Bean/POJO and expose them as a Map<String, Object>. It's crude but works for simple cases.My question is what other methodologies are there for approaching this problem besides reflection / converting to a Map?Before I go too much further down this path, I'd like to know if anyone knows how I could cannibalize something out of Rhino or perhaps javax.script.* which has a well thought out implementation of this concept. Or perhaps an entirely different approach that I haven't considered.Edit: yes I'm familiar with reflection (which I believe is what Introspector is using under the hood anyway). I was just curious if there was any other well thought out solutions.Edit 2: It appears that the most popular answers involve 1) reflection either directly or via helper classes, and/or 2) mapping to interfaces which implement the desired class members. I'm really intrigued by the comment which talks about leveraging Groovy. Since Groovy has true duck-typing and it is a JVM language, is there a way to make a simple helper in Groovy and call it from Java? This would be really cool and probably more flexible and perform better.Answer: I marked Mike's answer as the best since it is a complete concept which comes the closest. I probably won't go that route for this particular case, but it is certainly a useful approach. Anyone looking through this should be sure to read the conversations on here as there is a lot of useful info in there as well.Thanks! <code> ",Simulating duck typing in Java

Detecting the present annotations within the given object passed into a constructor [java]," My question in short: how do I detect if a java annotation is present (and in the right place) for a given user class/object.Details of the ""problem""Lets say I have two java classes: A Line object holds Cells.I also have two annotations, like: I also have a bunch of user classes (two will do for this example) that contain the @Line and @Cell annotations I specified, like: The problem: When I instantiate a new Line object, I want to be able to pass the user classes/objects into the Line constructor. The Line constructor then finds out if the passed user classes/objects are valid classes that can be processed. Only user classes that have a @Line annotation for the class, and at least one @Cell annotation for its members are valid objects that can be passed into the constructor of the Line object.All other passed objects are invalid. The moment a valid user object is passed, all the available members that are tagged as @Cell in that object are transformed to Cell objects and added to the cells list.My questions:is this possible to detect the annotations in this object/class at runtime, and only for THIS passed object (I don't want to scan for annotations on the classpath!)?is it possible to detect the datatype of the @Cell tagged members? This is needed because the Cell class doesn't accept all datatypes.is it possible to retrieve the actual member name (specified in the java file) so that the user doesn't have to specify the members Cell name. I want the user to be able to write @Cell (without a name) and @Cell(name=""aName""), and when only @Cell is specified, the name of the member is used instead. I have no idea if this information is still available at runtime using reflection.How to detect if the annotations are in the right place?If code is tagged like this, then the object should be ignored (or maybe an exception is thrown)?

JPA getSingleResult vs ResultList," I want to know whether a given record is present in a database or not. so far I have achieved this by writing a JPA query and the running it by getSingleResult() method. this would throw a NoResultException if the record with the given parameter does not exist.

I have a website with a popular host (PHP+MYSQL Hosting). I want to create a page on the website with PHP with a form where a user can upload an image which will then pass the image onto the Java application.What I am planning on doing is when then user uploads the image, it gets stored in a folder on the web server. I will then call the java app on the server passing the url of the image as an argument and then the java app will output another image, lets say, to a result folder. The PHP page after the execution will then display the result image on the browser.Now my questions are:Is it possible to execute java apps on popular webhosts (for example mine is WebHostingBuzz.com)?The java app is fairly heavy as it does a lot of image processing. Should I offload the java app to another web server? If yes, are there any services that will run my java app?(Optional) Its a demo of my java app and I dont want to store the images people upload. Is there a way where I can directly pass the uploaded image to the java app and output the image generated directly instead of storing it on the web server? I would prefer this because, if the image is big, I can make PHP stop the execution after a timeout.How do I communicate with the java app from PHP for info on its execution, for example When PHP calls the java app, the page has to wait till the app finishes processing?

Difference between java's .jar and .net's .dll file," I am learning Java these days and I've spent a lot of time with .NET so when I want to export or import libraries, they are usually in .dll format which is called assemblies in .NET environment and they are compiled to IL and they can have resources like images, XML, audio and so on, anyways.I am wondering the same process in Java as well. I've read documents but they actually confused me a little bit and to clarify things out I need your help guys.Questions:.NET Assembly is the same thing as Java .jar?.dll contains compiled IL code and .jar contains compiled .class/byte code files?They say resources, what kind of resources we are talking about here? Images, .txt files, etc. or all of them possible?I've examined AWS (Amazon Web Service API for java) and I saw three .jar file and they areaws-java-sdk-1.1.1.jaraws-java-sdk-1.1.1-javadoc.jaraws-java-sdk-1.1.1-sources.jarand they contain .class files - java documentation in html format and .java files which are still not compiled. So then I've realized .jar doesn't just include compiled byte codes (.class) and also other things.When I want to import java libraries, will I always need to import .jar files?When I want to export my own java libraries, should I need to export in .jar file.Thanks for help in advance. <code> ",Difference between .jar and .dll file

Jersey + Jackson JSON date serialization format problem - how to change the format or use custom JacksonJsonProvider," I am using Jersey + Jackson to provide REST JSON services layer for my application. The problem I have is that the default Date serialization format looks like that: At first I thought it is a UNIX timestamp... but it is too long for that. My client-side JS library has problems deserializing this format (it supports a bunch of different date formats but not this one I suppose). I want to change the format so that it can be consumable by my library (to ISO for example). How do I do that... I found a piece of code that could help but... where do I put it as I don't control the Jackson serializer instantiation (Jersey does)? I also found this code for custom JacksonJsonProvider - the question is .. how do I make all my POJO classes use it? <code>  ""CreationDate"":1292236718456 objectMapper.configure( SerializationConfig.Feature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS, false); @Providerpublic class MessageBodyWriterJSON extends JacksonJsonProvider { private static final String DF = ""yyyy-MM-ddT'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ""; @Override public boolean isWriteable(Class arg0, Type arg1, Annotation[] arg2, MediaType arg3) { return super.isWriteable(arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3); } @Override public void writeTo(Object target, Class arg1, Type arg2, Annotation[] arg3, MediaType arg4, MultivaluedMap arg5, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException, WebApplicationException { SimpleDateFormat sdf=new SimpleDateFormat(DF); ObjectMapper om = new ObjectMapper(); om.getDeserializationConfig().setDateFormat(sdf); om.getSerializationConfig().setDateFormat(sdf); try { om.writeValue(outputStream, target); } catch (JsonGenerationException e) { throw e; } catch (JsonMappingException e) { throw e; } catch (IOException e) { throw e; } }}",Jersey + Jackson JSON date format serialization - how to change the format or use custom JacksonJsonProvider

Java conditional compilation: how to prevent code chunks to be compiled?," My project requires Java 1.6 for compilation and running. Now I have a requirement to make it working with Java 1.5 (from the marketing side). I want to replace method body (return type and arguments remain the same) to make it compiling with Java 1.5 without errors.Details: I have an utility class called OS which encapsulates all OS-specific things. It has a method to open files like with double-click (start Windows command or open Mac OS X command equivalent). Since it cannot be compiled with Java 1.5, I want to exclude it during compilation and replace by another method which calls run32dll for Windows or open for Mac OS X using Runtime.exec.Question: How can I do that? Can annotations help here?Note: I use ant, and I can make two java files OS4J5.java and OS4J6.java which will contain the OS class with the desired code for Java 1.5 and 1.6 and copy one of them to OS.java before compiling (or an ugly way - replace the content of OS.java conditionally depending on java version) but I don't want to do that, if there is another way.Elaborating more: in C I could use ifdef, ifndef, in Python there is no compilation and I could check a feature using hasattr or something else, in Common Lisp I could use #+feature. Is there something similar for Java?Found this post but it doesn't seem to be helpful.Any help is greatly appreciated. kh. <code>  public static void openFile(java.io.File file) throws java.io.IOException { // open the file using java.awt.Desktop ...}",Java conditional compilation: how to prevent code chunks from being compiled?

JSTL vs jsp scriptlets," I want someone to explain some points in BlausC's amazing answer in this question.He said that scriptlets had some disadvantages, which are:Reusability: you can't reuse scriptlets. My question : how could I reuse JSTL code?Replaceability: you can't make scriptlets abstract. What does abstract mean and how could JST become abstract?OO: you can't make use of inheritance/composition. How could I use OO paradigms in JSTL?Debugging: if a scriptlet throws an exception halfway, all you get is a blank page.Testability: scriptlets can't be unit tested. What does that mean, and how can JSTL be unit tested?Maintainability: per saldo, more time is needed to maintain mingled/cluttered/duplicated code logic. What does this mean?The last thing is what he quoted form Oracle's recommendation: JSP scriptlets should not be used for writing business logic.In the MVC pattern, I use scriptlets only in the presentation layer.

What is the best solution for handling multiplatform (dev/integ/valid/prod...) development? Delivery process...," I'm not so experienced but i worked on some big Java EE projects (using maven2) with very distinct ways to handle the installation / delivery on the different platforms.1) One of them was to use snapshots for development and then make a maven release, of components and main webapplications. Thus the delivery is:war/ear filesList itemproperties filessgdb filessome others And teams will use that files to put the new application versions in the different platforms.I think this process is strict and permits you to always keep easily the different configurations passed in production, but it's not really flexible, the process is a bit heavy and it conducted us to sometimes do some dirty things like overriding a class of a war to patch a regression...This is an e-commerce website with 10million unique visitors per month and a 99.89% availability.2) Another i saw is to checkout the sources on each platform and then install the snapshot artifacts in a local repository. Then the application server will use these snapshots of the .m2 folder.There is not a real delivery process since to put a new version in production, we just have to update the sources of the components / webapps, do some maven clean install and restart the application server.I think it's more flexible but i see some drawbacks and this approach seems dangerous for me.This website has a frontoffice, i don't know the numbers but it's far less than the 1st one. It also has a big backoffice available for most employees of a 130 000 people company.I guess depending on the website, its exposition to the public and the availability required, we have to adapt the delivery strategy to the needs.I'm not here to ask which solution is the best but wonder if you have seen different things, and which strategy you would use in which case? <code> ",What is the best solution for handling multiplatform (dev/integ/valid/prod...) development?

Is it really worth implementing toString() for entity classes?," It is consistently advised to override (implement) the toString() method of a class.The Java API documentation itself says ""It is recommended that all subclasses override this method."".Bloch, in Effective Java has the item ""Always override toString"". And only a fool contradicts Bloch, right?I am however coming to doubt this advice: is it really worth implementing toString() for entity classes?I'll try to lay out my reasoning.An entity object has a unique identity; it is never the same as another object, even if the two entites have equivalent attribute values. That is, (for non-null x), the following invariant applies for an entity class (by definition):x.equals(y) == (x == y)The toString() method returns a string that ""textually represents"" its object (in the words of the Java API).A good representation captures the essentials of the object, so if two representations are different they are representaions of different (non-equivalent) objects, and conversely if two represenations are equivalent they are representations of equivalent objects. That suggests the following invariant for a good representation (for non-null x, y):x.toString().equals(y.toString()) == x.equals(y)Thus for entities we expectx.toString().equals(y.toString()) == (x == y)that is, each entity object should have a unique textual representation, which toString() returns. Some entity classes will have a unique name or numeric ID field, so their toString() method could return a representation that includes that name or numeric ID. But in general, the toString() method does not have access to such a field.Without a unique field for an entity, the best that toString() can do is to include a field that is unlikely to be the same for different objects. But that is exactly the requirement of System.identityHashCode(), which is what Object.toString() provides.So Object.toString() is OK for an entity object that has no data members, but for most classes you would want to include them in the text representation, right? In fact, you'd want to include all of them: if the type has a (non null) data member x, you would want to include x.toString() in the representation.But this creates a problem for data members that hold references to other entities: that is, which are associations. If a Person object has a Person father data member, the naive implementation will produce a fragment of that person's family tree, not of the Person itself. If there are two-way assocaitions, a naive implementation will recurse until you get stack overflow So maybe skip the data members that hold associations?But what about a value type Marriage having Person husband and Person wife data members? Those associations ought to be reported by Marriage.toString(). The simplest way to make all the toString() methods work is for Person.toString() to report only the identity fields (Person.name or System.identityhashCode(this)) of the Person.So it seems that the provided implementation of toString() is actually not too bad for entity classes.

Problem with implementing a logical AND problem in Java," I am trying to solve a problem that involves basically implementing a logical AND between the input parameter.The complexity of the problem involves the size of the input parameters. To give a high level overview, I am trying to implement the logic similar to The complexity is that some of the input parameters can be 400 bits long. Its not a true binary number representation. It's more of a positional representation. The same input can be represented as So basically ""x"" is just a prefix with the value for it. This is an ACL system designed a long time ago and I am trying to implement a Java version for it.I couldn't find a data type in Java that could be used to represent a binary representation that is as huge as having 400 bits. I can also use the decimal representation [ie., x2,3] and solve it too, but I couldn't think of way other than looping through the entire number range and comparing it with the other input parameter. Both input parameters could be normalized to the same representation format [ie., binary or decimal].Any suggestions (or) help on how I can solve this problem? <code>  100 & 100 == 100001 & 010 == 0001 & 100 == 0..... 100 = x1; (or) x100011 = x2,3; (or) x011001.......11 = x3,......450,451;",Problem with implementing a bitwise AND problem in Java
Why Java methods with varargs become transient?," I was playing with Java Reflection API and observed that methods with variadic argument list become transient. Why is that and what does transient keyword mean in this context? From Java Glossary, transient: A keyword in the Java programming language that indicates that a field is not part of the serialized form of an object. When an object is serialized, the values of its transient fields are not included in the serial representation, while the values of its non-transient fields are included.However this definition does not say anything about methods. Any ideas? Outputs: <code>  import java.lang.reflect.Method;import java.lang.reflect.Modifier;public class Dummy { public static void main(String[] args) { for(Method m : Dummy.class.getDeclaredMethods()){ System.out.println(m.getName() + "" --> ""+Modifier.toString(m.getModifiers())); } } public static void foo(int... args){}} main --> public staticfoo --> public static transient",Why Java methods with varargs identified as transient?

Java Read File in bytes," How can I read a file to bytes in Java?It is important to note that all the bytes need to be positive, i.e. the negative range cannot be used.Can this be done in Java, and if yes, how?I need to be able to multiply the contents of a file by a constant. I was assuming that I can read the bytes into a BigInteger and then multiply, however since some of the bytes are negative I am ending up with 12 13 15 -12 etc and get stuck. <code> ",How can I read a file as unsigned bytes in Java?

Java Compiler Bug with generics and for-each?," I got a strange compiler error when using generics within a for-each loop in Java. Is this a Java compiler bug, or am I really missing something here?Here is my whole class: The compiler is complaining about the line with the for-each: ""Type mismatch cannot convert from element type Object to String.""If I make this subtle change, it compiles: I know getList() does use generics, but it uses them in what I thought was a completely unrelated way. I could understand this if I were trying to iterate over something of type T and getList() returned a List<T> or something, but that's not the case here. The return type of getList() should have absolutely nothing to do with T and shouldn't care whether I use the raw type for my Generics object or not...right?

Isn't this a concern ?Update 1:Now, it is no longer necessary to save state while using JSF. A high performance Stateless JSF implementation is available for use. See this blog & this question for relevant details & discussion. Also, there is an open issue to include in JSF specs, an option to provide stateless mode for JSF.(P.S. Consider voting for the issues this & this if this is a useful feature for you.)Update 2 (24-02-2013):A great news that Mojarra 2.1.19 is out with stateless mode!See here:http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mriem/archive/2013/02/08/jsf-going-stateless?force=255http://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES-2731http://balusc.blogspot.de/2013/02/stateless-jsf.html <code> ",Why JSF saves the state of UI components on server?

Parsing JAVA Source Code, I am asked to develop a software which should be able to create Flow chart/ Control Flow of the input Java source code. So I started researching on it and arrived at following solutions:To create flow chart/control flow I have to recognize controlling statements and function calls made in the given source code Now I have two ways of recognizing:Parse the Source code by writing my own grammars (A complex solution I think). I am thinking to use Antlr for this.Read input source code files as text and search for the specific patterns (May become inefficient) Am I right here? Or I am missing something very fundamental and simple? Which approach would take less time and do the work efficiently? Any other suggestions in this regard will be welcome too. Any other efficient approach would help because the input source code may span multiple files and can be fairly complex.I am good in .NET languages but this is my first big project in Java. I have basic knowledge of Compiler Design so writing grammars should not be impossible for me.Sorry If I am being unclear. Please ask for any clarifications. <code> ,Parsing Java Source Code

How to persist a lot of entities (JPA)," I need to process a CSV file and for each record (line) persist an entity.

It seems to be quite slow. Would it be better to use EntityManager.persist()? Is this solution flawed in any way?EDITIt's a lengthy process (over 400s) and I tried both solutions, with persist and merge. Both take approximately the same amount of time to complete (459s vs 443s). The question is if saving the entities one by one like this is optimal.

inherriting static variable from abstract class," I have half a dozen classes which all extend the same abstract class. The abstract class has a static variable pointing to some JNI code that I only want to load once per instantiation of the classes. From what I understand this results in exactly one instance of this static variable being instantiated, but what I want is for each of the extending classes to have their own static instance of the variable that is unique for the given child class. I want to write some code in my abstract class that modifies and/or releases the abstract class. Is it possible to do both of these things at once?So as an example can I write an abstract class bar with an variable foo and a printFoo method which prints the content of foo. Then I instantiate in order fooBar1, fooBar2, and fooBar3 which each extend the bar class and initialize foo to different values in static blocks. If I call foobar1.printFoo I want to print the static value of foo initialized by fooBar1 constructor.Can this be done in java? <code> ",Inheriting static variable from abstract class

am i making this too complicated (Image rotation)?," I have some server code that is generating thumbnails when an image is uploaded. The issue is that when the image was taken and the camera/device was rotated, the thumbnails are rotated, even though the full size images themselves are displayed in the correct orientation in any image viewing software. This is only happening with jpgs.Using Preview on OSX, I can see that jpgs have orientation metadata embedded within. When I use ImageTools (Grails Plugin) to generate a thumbnail, the EXIF metadata is not in the thumbnail, which is why the thumbnails appear rotated. Via offline conversations, I have learned that while it is relatively easy to read EXIF metadata, there is no easy way to write it, which is why the data is lost when generating a jpg thumbnail.So it seems I have two options: Use ImageMagick to generate the thumbnails. The downside is it requires installed more software on our servers.Read the EXIF Orientation data is code and rotate the thumbnail appropriately.Does anyone know of any other options? <code> ",How to rotate JPEG images based on the orientation metadata?

Round Robin (RRD) with variable intervals," I am looking for the best mechanism to store a bunch of environmental data and like the concept of a round-robin database (rrd) to cap the size of the database. This will be used for a Java Web-app so I am more keen on using Java based technology. The tool I have been looking at is JRobin and RRD4JHowever, it appears RRD is designed to store data at fixed interval. Is this correct?The data I am looking to store are temperature, humidity, event driven data such as door open/closed, dry contact open/closed.Temperature and Humidity data can be polled, but the hardware also send updates to us which is based on when the hardware detects a change (so not regular-interval). I would also like to store this as well.Event-driven data will not be polled and will only be stored when the sensor send us the data.To summarize, my question will be 2 folds:Can RRD tools be used to store non-regular interval data?If RRD tools cannot be used to store non-regular interval data, any suggestion on how to store non-regular interval data in a way which the storage mechanism automatically caps the size of the data store? <code> ",Round Robin data storage for non-regular interval time series data

J2EE: Creating and deleting socket listeners dynamically from the domain model.," I am creating a Java EE application that allows users to add/remove ""socketinfo"" tables (stored in a database) from a web interface. If the user enables a ""socketinfo"" from the web interface, the application server must create a socket listener for the incoming packets and process the data. If the user disables or deletes the ""socketinfo"" the socket listener must be removed. The entire product must be contained in a single ear, and preferrably compliant. Some approaches I have considered but ran into problems with are:Create a JCA resource adaptor for sockets and use MDBs as the listeners. The problem I ran into here was that I cannot figure out how to programmatically deploy MDBs for different sockets when the user adds them.Create a @Singleton/@Service ejb that manages the daemon threads with careful synchronization. The singleton ejb can be injected into the business layer so that CRUD operations and socket manipulation happen in the right workflow. The problem here was that supposedly creating threads from EJBs is considered a bad practice and is not spec compliant (even if the singleton life cycle is correctly handled and proper synchronization mechanisms are in place?).Put the threads in the domain model (another singleton?) and have the EJBs use the model. This was the worst of all of them since application servers tend to have multiple classloaders, less container support in general, plus this suffers from everything 2. suffers from.Any idea how to correctly handle this situation in Java EE?EDIT: An extension to this question: Assuming I decide to approach this problem like ewernli suggests in his solution 3, what do I gain by doing this in JCA (with a custom interface to add internal threads) that I would not get from a (well-designed) singleton? While creating a resource adapter does not look like a monstrous task, it does not seem entirely trivial and could be a little time consuming (and maybe even harder to follow for other developers). <code> ",Java EE: Creating and deleting socket listeners dynamically from the domain model.
How to reproduce a dropped TCP/IP connection?," I have a situation where a Java program establishes a long-running TCP/IP connection to a server and said connection is functioning exactly as documented, except for one thing in an environment outside my control.Every Saturday that server is rebooted, but for some reason this is not communicated properly to my client so the connection just hangs waiting for a response for ever and ever. This is exactly the same behaviour seen with stale JDBC-connections, where some router in between server and client has found the connection to be idle and dropped it without notification.I need to be able to reproduce this scenario to be able to create a proper fix. Hence I need to know if there is a good way to simulate a router silently dropping connections under my control? I can put a Linux box or a Mac between my development environment and the server. I can run the JVM in a virtual machine (vmware player) if I can do the dropping there. Suggestions are very welcome.EDIT 2012-12-18: The solution that worked for me was to use a Java-based SOCKS5-proxy locally which could be suspended with Ctrl-Z at will, and tell my application to go through it. <code> ",How to reproduce a silently dropped TCP/IP connection?

Persisting a Collection class in ORMLite in android," I have two classes setup like the following. I am confused as to when I need to annotate something as an foreign collection and when I do not. This may also sound silly, but nowhere in the ORMLite documentation does it say whether or not a non-foreign collection is allowed. What if I have a List of ints which get autoboxed into Integers? can I just persist this using a standard @DatabaseField above the Collection? A foreign collection, according to ORMLite, must also have back reference for it to work (a reference to the parent, given a one to many realtionship). For the example below, I am assuming you should annotate myBList as a foreign collection as well as making myA a foreign object, but how could you handle myStringList?I Have seen sample code here but it doesn't answer my questions: http://ormlite.com/docs/examples <code>  public class A { private Set<B> myBList = new HashSet<B>(); private List<String> myStringList = new ArrayList<String>(); private long id; public A(){} public Set<B> getMyBList() { return myBList; } public void setMyBList(Set<B> myBList) { this.myBList = myBList; } public List<String> getMyStringList() { return myStringList; } public void setMyStringList(List<String> myStringList) { this.myStringList = myStringList; } public void setId(long id){ this.id = id; } public long getId(){ return id; }}public class B { private int myInt; private String myString; private A myA; private long id; public B(){} public A getMyA(){ return myA; } public A setMyA(A a){ myA = a; } public int getMyInt() { return myInt; } public void setMyInt(int myInt) { this.myInt = myInt; } public String getMyString() { return myString; } public void setMyString(String myString) { this.myString = myString; } public void setId(long id){ this.id = id; } public long getId(){ return id; }}",Persisting a Collection class with ORMLite in android
How to Implement gaussian mutation operator for genetic algorithm in java," I try to learn and implement a simple genetic algorithm library for my project. At this time, evolution, selection of population is ready, and I'm trying to implement a simple good mutation operator like the Gaussian mutation operator (GMO) for my genetic evolution engine in Java and Scala.I find some information on Gaussian mutation operator (GMO) into the paper A mutation operator based on a Pareto ranking for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (P.M. Mateo, I. Alberto), page 6 and 7.But I have some problem to find other information on how to implement this Gaussian mutation operator and other useful variants of this operator in Java. What should I do?I'm using the random.nextGaussian() function of random Java util, but this method only returns a random number between 0 and 1.So, a) How can I modify the precision of the return number in this case?

How can I ajust that local research around my genome value?After research, I found an answer for the b) question. It seems I can displace the Gaussian random number like this: where mean = my genome value.(Cf. method of bottom page in How can I generate random numbers with a normal or Gaussian distribution?.) <code>  newGenomeValue = oldGenomeValue + (( gaussiandRndNumber * sigma ) + mean )",How to implement the Gaussian mutation operator for a genetic algorithm in Java

Exchange data in real time over AJAX," I am developing an application in JSF 2.0 and I would like to have a multiline textbox which displays output data which is being read (line by line) from a file in real time.So the goal is to have a page with a button on it that triggers the backend to start reading from the file and then displaying the results as it's reading in the textbox.I had thought about doing this in the following way:Have the local page keep track of what lines it has retrieved/displayed in the textbox so far.Periodically the local page will poll the backend using AJAX and request any new data that has been read (tell it what lines the page has so far and only retrieve the new lines since then).This will continue until the entire file has been completely retrieved.The issue is that the bean method that reads from the file is running a while loop that blocks. So to read from the data structure it is writing to at the same time will require using additional Threads, correct? I hear that spawning new Threads in a web application is a potentially dangerous move and that Thread pools should be used, etc.Can anyone shed some insight on this?Update: I tried a couple of different things with no luck. But I did manage to get it working by spawning a separate Thread to run my blocking loop while the main thread could be used to read from it whenever an AJAX request is processed. Is there a good library I could use to do something similar to this that still gives JSF some lifecycle control over this Thread? <code> ",Exchange data in real time over AJAX with multiple threads

Why wasn't java.util.Serializable deprecated in Java 5?," In pre Java 5, there were no annotations. As a result you could not add metadata to a class.To mark a class as serializable, you had to implement the Serializable interface (which is just that, a marker) and use further transient keywords to mark a field as non serializable if needed, something like: Now you could theoretically make use of annotations (this is a perfect use for them) and have: But the interface and the keyword were not deprecated and no annotation was added in Java 5 to replace them.What are the considerations for this decision to keep the interface and the keyword?Off course there is the issue of compatibility with pre Java 5 code, but at some point that will end (e.g. related to the new features of generics, the JLS specifies that It is possible that future versions of the Java programming language will disallow the use of raw types). So why not prepare the way for serialized annotations also?Any thoughts? (although I would prefer concrete references :D which I was unable to find) <code>  public class MyClass implements Serializable { ... private transient Bla field; ...} @Serializablepublic class MyClass { ... @Transient private Bla field; ...}",Why wasn't java.io.Serializable deprecated in Java 5?

Java seems to be executing bare-bones mathematics faster than c++. Why?," Introduction:Using two identical mergesort algorithms, I tested the execution speed of C++ (using Visual Studios C++ 2010 express) vs Java (using NetBeans 7.0). I conjectured that the C++ execution would be at least slightly faster, but testing revealed that the C++ execution was 4 - 10 times slower than the Java execution. I believe that I have set all the speed optimisations for C++, and I am publishing as a release rather than as a debug. Why is this speed discrepancy occurring?Code:Java: C++: Observations:For 10000 elements, the C++ execution takes roughly 4 times the amount of time as the Java execution.For 100000 elements, the ratio is about 7:1.For 10000000 elements, the ratio is about 10:1.For over 10000000, the Java execution completes, but the C++ execution stalls, and I have to manually kill the process. <code>  public class PerformanceTest1{ /** * Sorts the array using a merge sort algorithm * @param array The array to be sorted * @return The sorted array */ public static void sort(double[] array) { if(array.length > 1) { int centre; double[] left; double[] right; int arrayPointer = 0; int leftPointer = 0; int rightPointer = 0; centre = (int)Math.floor((array.length) / 2.0); left = new double[centre]; right = new double[array.length - centre]; System.arraycopy(array,0,left,0,left.length); System.arraycopy(array,centre,right,0,right.length); sort(left); sort(right); while((leftPointer < left.length) && (rightPointer < right.length)) { if(left[leftPointer] <= right[rightPointer]) { array[arrayPointer] = left[leftPointer]; leftPointer += 1; } else { array[arrayPointer] = right[rightPointer]; rightPointer += 1; } arrayPointer += 1; } if(leftPointer < left.length) { System.arraycopy(left,leftPointer,array,arrayPointer,array.length - arrayPointer); } else if(rightPointer < right.length) { System.arraycopy(right,rightPointer,array,arrayPointer,array.length - arrayPointer); } } } public static void main(String args[]) { //Number of elements to sort int arraySize = 1000000; //Create the variables for timing double start; double end; double duration; //Build array double[] data = new double[arraySize]; for(int i = 0;i < data.length;i += 1) { data[i] = Math.round(Math.random() * 10000); } //Run performance test start = System.nanoTime(); sort(data); end = System.nanoTime(); //Output performance results duration = (end - start) / 1E9; System.out.println(""Duration: "" + duration); }} #include <iostream>#include <windows.h>using namespace std;//Mergesortvoid sort1(double *data,int size){if(size > 1){ int centre; double *left; int leftSize; double *right; int rightSize; int dataPointer = 0; int leftPointer = 0; int rightPointer = 0; centre = (int)floor((size) / 2.0); leftSize = centre; left = new double[leftSize]; for(int i = 0;i < leftSize;i += 1) { left[i] = data[i]; } rightSize = size - leftSize; right = new double[rightSize]; for(int i = leftSize;i < size;i += 1) { right[i - leftSize] = data[i]; } sort1(left,leftSize); sort1(right,rightSize); while((leftPointer < leftSize) && (rightPointer < rightSize)) { if(left[leftPointer] <= right[rightPointer]) { data[dataPointer] = left[leftPointer]; leftPointer += 1; } else { data[dataPointer] = right[rightPointer]; rightPointer += 1; } dataPointer += 1; } if(leftPointer < leftSize) { for(int i = dataPointer;i < size;i += 1) { data[i] = left[leftPointer++]; } } else if(rightPointer < rightSize) { for(int i = dataPointer;i < size;i += 1) { data[i] = right[rightPointer++]; } } delete left; delete right;}}void main(){//Number of elements to sortint arraySize = 1000000;//Create the variables for timingLARGE_INTEGER start; //Starting timeLARGE_INTEGER end; //Ending timeLARGE_INTEGER freq; //Rate of time updatedouble duration; //end - startQueryPerformanceFrequency(&freq); //Determinine the frequency of the performance counter (high precision system timer)//Build arraydouble *temp2 = new double[arraySize];QueryPerformanceCounter(&start);srand((int)start.QuadPart);for(int i = 0;i < arraySize;i += 1){ double randVal = rand() % 10000; temp2[i] = randVal;}//Run performance testQueryPerformanceCounter(&start);sort1(temp2,arraySize);QueryPerformanceCounter(&end); delete temp2;//Output performance test resultsduration = (double)(end.QuadPart - start.QuadPart) / (double)(freq.QuadPart);cout << ""Duration: "" << duration << endl;//Dramatic pausesystem(""pause"");}",Java seems to be executing bare-bones algorithms faster than C++.

Is it possible to compile a java file without providing its depedencies?," There is a java file, which has some dependencies jars. But now, I don't have those jars, and I have to compile it to a .class file.Is it possible to do this?UPDATEThanks for your answers.At first, I thought we can create some stubs for the missing dependencies, that's easy but boring. Since we can create the stubs without missing stubs to make the compiler happy, why can't we make a tool do it automatically? The tool doesn't need to create stubs, but reads the java file, collects informations, and then builds the .class files.But if the ""import"" statements in the java file contain ""*"", that will be a problem: We don't know if the class ""World"" is under package ""aaa"" or ""bbb"". If we are not familiar with the missing dependencies, we even don't know how to create a stub for the class ""World"". But if the ""import"" statements are clear, I think it's possible, but maybe no one will write such a tool <code>  import aaa.*import bbb.*public class Hello { World world;}",Is it possible to compile a java file without providing its dependencies?
Writing integration tests for MongoDB," My question is a variation of this one.Since my Java Web-app project requires a lot of read filters/queries and interfaces with tools like GridFS, I'm struggling to think of a sensible way to employ MongoDB in the way the above solution suggests.Therefore, I'm considering running an embedded instance of MongoDB alongside my integration tests. I'd like it to start up automatically (either for each test or the whole suite), flush the database for every test, and shut down at the end. These tests might be run on development machines as well as the CI server, so my solution will also need to be portable.Can anyone with more knowledge on MongoDB help me get idea of the feasibility of this approach, and/or perhaps suggest any reading material that might help me get started?I'm also open to other suggestions people might have on how I could approach this problem... <code> ",Embedded MongoDB when running integration tests

I create (compatible) and then store all my images into an array at the start, and then reference them there.Note: I decided to make this game so that I can learn and practice some new ideas, so I'm not just trying to share it - I'm really interested to find out what's going on here. <code> ",How to approach Java 2D performance variations between different computers?

Java JNIEnv segfaulting," I'm in the process of doing some Java<->.NET interop code using a native library between them, so far things are going fairly well.However for some reason I cannot run any methods under JNIEnv. Now I can pass variables back and forth and do all other kinds of communication, so I'm figuring I haven't initialized this correctly or something.I'm loading it like this: (I prefer Native.loadLibrary because it seems to allow me to do more with it easier, such as class sharing between multiple libraries and unhooking and rehooking it from the JVM on the fly).Edit: Seriously any method: Getting version:(segfault)Any ideas on wht JNIEnv would segfault for every method? This should be set up by the JVM, correct?Edit 2:This is a Java application that is calling a C++ library that will interface with a .NET library (so it's a CLR compiled C++ library, if that makes any difference), to limit any external factors I'm not even calling the .NET DLL but just converting strings that come in back out (or well... trying).So for example from Java: Curious if it was the CLR that was causing it: Disabled clr compilation and stripped everything out that was CLR related, still does it.Edit 3:Got it to dump: So yeah, looks like the JVM isn't giving me memory access for some reason.Edit 4:Actual call: Edit 5:Works with System.loadLibrary: Output: Ack! I mean some headway, but I can't unload libraries from the JVM that are loaded in System.loadLibrary can I?I basically need to be able to unhook these libraries from the JVM and swap them out, on top of that they all need to ""share"" a single class and be able to be bound to the class at runtime... which is kinda why I went with Native.loadLibrary.Currently I do this:Load the DLL: Unhook it: Class I load them all into: Any way to work similarly with System.loadLibrary?Edit 6:Feel free to call me dumb, I'm using JNA, NOT JNI, which is completely different and a huge source of my problems.... is there a way to do this with JNI? Or can I get JNIEnv to register with JNA somehow? I'm guessing I can drop JNI from the C++ library and straight up use wstrings?I'll get back with this tomorrow. <code>  System::String^ JNIStringToNet(JNIEnv * env, jstring js){ const char *buf = env->GetStringUTFChars(js, 0); // segfault this.Lib = (LibHandler)Native.loadLibrary(this.Name, LibHandler.class); std::cout << ""Getting version:"" << std::endl;std::cout << env->GetVersion() << std::endl; this.Lib = (LibHandler)Native.loadLibrary(this.Name, LibHandler.class);this.Lib.myCPPMethod(); // Segmentation fault during this call, JVM crashes. ## A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:## EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x0000000000000000, pid=1596, tid=7248## JRE version: 6.0_23-b05# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (19.0-b09 mixed mode windows-amd64 compressed oops)# Problematic frame:# C 0x0000000000000000 JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL Query(JNIEnv * env, jobject jobj, jstring start, jstring end){ std::cout << ""Getting version:"" << std::endl; jint j = env->GetVersion(); return jstring(""test"");} JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_LibTest_T(JNIEnv *env, jobject jobj){ std::cout << ""Getting version:"" << std::endl; jint j = env->GetVersion(); std::cout << j << std::endl;} java -Djava.library.path=""(dir)\lib\64"" EntryPointGetting version:65542 this.Lib = (LibHandler)Native.loadLibrary(this.Name, LibHandler.class); this.Lib = null;Runtime.getRuntime().gc(); // Force the JVM to drop it immediately. public interface LibHandler extends Library{ void T();}",Java JNIEnv Segmentation Fault
org.dom4j.Document to org.w3c.dom.Document and XML Signature," I have some classes that already use DOM4J to read XML files and providegetter methods to the data. Now, I need to add the possibility of checking XML digitalsignatures.

Bulk Insert in Java using Prepared Statements batch Update," I am trying to fill a resultSet in Java with about 50,000 rows of 10 columnsand then inserting them into another table using the batchExecute method of PreparedStatement.To make the process faster I did some research and found that while reading data into resultSet the fetchSize plays an important role.Having a very low fetchSize can result into too many trips to the server and a very high fetchSize can block the network resources, so I experimented a little bit and set up an optimum size that suits my infrastructure.I am reading this resultSet and creating insert statements to insert into another table of a different database.Something like this (just a sample, not real code): Will the executeBatch method try to send all the data at once ?Is there a way to define the batch size?Is there any better way to speed up the process of bulk insertion?While updating in bulk (50,000 rows 10 cols), is it better to use a updatable ResultSet or PreparedStaement with batch execution? <code>  for (i=0 ; i<=50000 ; i++) { statement.setString(1, ""a@a.com""); statement.setLong(2, 1); statement.addBatch();}statement.executeBatch();",Bulk insert in Java using prepared statements batch update

Why doesn't java varargs support collections?," In my Java code I often use the very handy method(Class... args) varargs. As far as I know, they allow you to pass any amount of Class objects or an array of Class[]. Since I also often use the Java collection classes, I am frustrated by the lack of compatibility between both. As a result, I end up doing collection.toArray(), but that has some type safety issues.So now for the question: why doesn't Java allow instances of Iterable<T> as vararg arguments, as long as the generic type fits the T... type of the vararg? Doesn't everyone use lists, sets, etc. all the time? Is there an easy, type-safe way to provide the conversion from collection to vararg? <code> ",Why doesn't Java varargs support collections?

Noob question: applying casts to the results of integer and floating point division," I'm a beginner and there's something that's not making much sense to me. Please could be so kind as to explain where I'm going wrong. I'm sorry if this has been asked before.Here the presence of the decimal point mean these get evaluated using floating point division. Apparently, this below is an example of ""truncating-integer division."" It seems a bit weird to me but ok. Is it ok to say: ""in the line below, the (double) cast is evaluated 1st. It effectively says: ""treat 1/3 as a double - don't use truncating integer division. instead use floating point division."""" Below, however we get 0.0 - how did that happen? ok so maybe the extra parentheses mean the (1/3) gets evaluated 1st. It is evaluated using truncating integer division yielding 0. And then the double is applied giving us 0.0 Ok that makes senseOk so we maybe can propose a couple of general rules here:Rule 1: (double) expression means apply the (double) cast first then evaluate the expression.Rule 2: (double) (expression) means evaluate the expression then apply the cast. Great!So in the next line below we have: (int) expression, so I guess we can apply rule 1). The (int) cast is evaluated 1st. It effectively says: ""treat 1.0/3 as a int - don't use as much memory as you would with a double. Don't use floating point division, instead apply truncating integer division."""" So we have 0 right? No. Ok so we have 0.33333 so the (int) cast is not evaluated 1st. It is as if it wasn't there. Let's propose a 3rd rule:Rule 3: (int) expression means ignore the (int) cast altogether just evaluate the expression like the (int) isn't even there. Ok applying rule 3 to the line below, we have (int) but we are just going to ignore it. 1.0/3.0 is evaluated with floating point division and we get 0.3333333. Success! And in the last line below, again we have (int) but we are just going to ignore it. (1.0/3) is evaluated using floating point division yielding 0.3333333333 right? No. Ok now I'm confused. Please could you help me get my head round this? <code>  System.out.println(1/3.0); // this prints: 0.3333333333333333System.out.println(1.0/3); // this prints: 0.3333333333333333System.out.println(1.0/3.0); // this prints: 0.3333333333333333 System.out.println(1/3); // this prints: 0 System.out.println((double)1/3); // this prints: 0.3333333333333333 System.out.println((double)(1/3)); // this prints: 0.0 System.out.println((int)1/3.0); // this prints: 0.3333333333333333 System.out.println((int)1.0/3.0); // this prints: 0.3333333333333333 System.out.println((int)(1.0/3)); // this prints: 0",Applying casts to the results of integer and floating point division: what's going on here?

This piece of code: Ended up hanging for about 8.5 minutes. So clearly there's a need for some sort of timeout condition on this statement to make it fail in the case of my particular scenario. I can't guarantee that I won't see a similar hardware issue in the future.I should mention that I'm still fairly new to Hibernate, so it's possible that I just don't understand some things like the association between using save() versus using Criteria, Transactions, etc. So I've found the following:hibernate.c3p0.timeout can be used to set connection timeouts on the C3P0 connection poolgetSession().getTransaction().setTimeout(...) can be used to timeout a transactiongetSession().createQuery(...).setTimeout(...) can be used to timeout a queryI've seen the JPA 2 javax.persistence.query.timeout, but I'm not entirely sure it's what I want (I also don't think my Hibernate version is new enough)None of these seems like exactly what I want to do (except maybe the JPA 2 one). This seems like it should be really simple. Is there something I'm missing here?Thanks! <code>  getSession().save(entity); //session is an instance of org.hibernate.Session",How can I set a timeout on a Hibernate save() call with a MySQL backend?
"Java - KeyListener, keyPressed versus keyTyped"," I have a JFrame (well, a class which extends JFrame) and I want to do an action when I press the F5 key. So, I made the class implement KeyListener.

How to ocmpare large text files?," I have a general question on your opinion about my ""technique"".There are 2 textfiles (file_1 and file_2) that need to be compared to each other. Both are very huge (3-4 gigabytes, from 30,000,000 to 45,000,000 lines each). My idea is to read several lines (as many as possible) of file_1 to the memory, then compare those to all lines of file_2. If there's a match, the lines from both files that match shall be written to a new file. Then go on with the next 1000 lines of file_1 and also compare those to all lines of file_2 until I went through file_1 completely.But this sounds actually really, really time consuming and complicated to me. Can you think of any other method to compare those two files?How long do you think the comparison could take?For my program, time does not matter that much. I have no experience in working with such huge files, therefore I have no idea how long this might take. It shouldn't take more than a day though. ;-) But I am afraid my technique could take forever...Antoher question that just came to my mind: how many lines would you read into the memory? As many as possible? Is there a way to determine the number of possible lines before actually trying it?I want to read as many as possible (because I think that's faster) but I've ran out of memory quite often.Thanks in advance.EDITI think I have to explain my problem a bit more.The purpose is not to see if the two files in general are identical (they are not). There are some lines in each file that share the same ""characteristic"". Here's an example:file_1 looks somewhat like this: file_2looks like this: TEXT refers to characters and digits that are of no interest for me, mat can go from mat1 - mat50 and are in no order; also there can be 1000x mat2 (but the numbers in the next column are different). I need to find the fitting lines in a way that: matX is the same in both compared lines an the number mentioned in file_2 fits into the range mentioned in file_1.So in my example I would find one match: line 3 of file_1and line 1 of file_2 (because both are mat3 and 10009 is between 10000 and 10010).I hope this makes it clear to you!So my question is: how would you search for the matching lines?Yes, I use Java as my programming language.EDITI now divided the huge files first so that I have no problems with being out of memory. I also think it is faster to compare (many) smaller files to each other than those two huge files. After that I can compare them the way I mentioned above. It may not be the perfect way, but I am still learning ;-) Nonentheless all your approaches were very helpful to me, thank you for your replies! <code>  mat1 1000 2000 TEXT //this means the range is from 1000 - 2000mat1 2040 2050 TEXTmat3 10000 10010 TEXTmat2 20 500 TEXT mat3 10009 TEXTmat3 200 TEXTmat1 999 TEXT",How to compare large text files?

Java tuning parameters ( Garbage Collection), I have a server java component which has a huge memory demand at startup which mellows down gradually. So as an example at startup the memory requirement might shoot unto 4g; which after the initial surge is over will go down to 2g. I have configured the component to start with memory of 5g and the component starts well; the used memory surges upto 4g and then comes down close to 2g. The memory consumed by the heap at this point still hovers around 4g and I want to bring this down (essentially keep the free memory down to few hundred mb's rather than 2g. I tried using the MinFreeHeapRatio and MaxFreeHeapRatio by lowering them down from the default values but this resulted in garbage collection not being triggered after the initial run during the initial spike and the used memory stayed at a higher than usual level. Any pointers would greatly help. <code> ,Tuning Garbage Collection parameters in Java

What is actual Factory pattern and some doubts?," Many people say they are using factory pattern in their project. But when i actually see their implementation it looks totally differentfrom definition what i have read in head first book. In the book they have described two kind of factory pattern i.e Factory Method:- A class specifies its sub-classes to specify which objects to create based on some parameter. So we expect here some abstract method in base class whihich will be implemented by child class and pupose of that will be to create some object Abstract Factory:- Provides an factory (in form of interface or abstract factory)for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.I have a question here on what do they mean by family of dependent or relatedobjects. Lets refer to http://www.apwebco.com/gofpatterns/creational/AbstractFactory.html. As per my understanding it means that in FinancialToolsFactory (in the link) is able to create TaxProcessor which is a family of products where actuall concreate products are CanadaTaxProcessor and EuropeTaxProcessor . So here we will have n number of concrete factories(in this case CanadaFinancialToolsFactory and EuropeFinancialToolsFactory) which will be extending/implementing abstract factory in this case FinancialToolsFactory.Please let me know if above understanding is correct as i think its the crux of Factory pattern.Second question:What people are doing on the name of factory pattern is below: They are just passing class like Example.class from main method and getting the object instance for that specific class.Now if we go by actual concept of factory pattern which is described in beginning(from head first book) and other websites it does not follow any of the two factory patterns. To me it looks like a utility class where we are passing the class and getting the object instance. Please let me know if you folks agree with this? <code>  public class MyFactory{ public static <T> T getObject(Class<T> cls) { if (cls == null) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid className""); } T daoObject = (T)map.get(cls); if (daoObject == null) { daoObject = loadObject(cls); } return daoObject; }}",Questions regarding the Factory pattern
Java concurrency sychronization basic question," If I access an object inside of a synchronized method or synchronized block, are all object in that accessed element also synchronized? Imagine there's an object Queue having a synchronized add() and take() method, accepting and handing out the complex object Thing. Thing has a lot of lists with other different objects in it. Now image thread Before creates Thing and puts some existing objects into Thing, modifies some of these object and so on. The Before thread adds Thing to Queue. A bit later thread After takes the Thing from Queue. QUESTION: Will Thing and all its children/subobject be in the same state as Before left them in? Even if thread After was maybe working on one of these subelements a bit earlier? Because I image the processor for thread After might still have some cached information on that subelement (the address of that subobject is still the same). All this cached stuff would be invalidated only through accessing the father object Thing in a synchronized way?Please don't give answers like use the concurrency libs etc. I want to understand what is going on. <code> ","Will Java's synchronization update the complete cache, or only the object I synchronized on?"
Java distributed system- First steps in computer science final year project," I'm starting my final year computer science project and I'm trying to figure out my first steps. For more details you can go to the project page.Background:Because I have very little experience in distributed systems I basically though how should I face such a challenge. What I came up with is that the system should work as following: The client sends out a file, or a set of files that contains code to be processed. That code will implement a distributed algorithm interface written by me, a specific class. The server will create an object from the class.That object will be responsible for the algorithm to be run. The server will return the results to the client. (I actually read about RMI later and found it very similar).Sending out files is basic - common network I/O.The real problem is object creation and using it as the predefined interface in run-time. Questions:The challenge that I have presented sounds like a reflection challenge, Is this correct? Do you have any first tips on how to implement it? Looking for some distributed systems java technologies I've encountered RMI, TRMI, LINDA, CORBA, JINI and many others. RMI sounds the most appealing because it's very similar to what I've gathered to be the solution, but it's also old.What set of libraries do you think will help me complete this task? Remember I'm a computer science student, so complete out of the box solutions will not stick with my professors. RMI is old, any better solutions out there ? any comprehensive tutorial on TRMI?If you find my logic some how faulty, please correct it.If you have some more tips on the subject that you think that should be discussed feel free to contact me. <code> ",Java distributed system

Why are annotations under Android such a performance problem?," I'm the lead author of ORMLite which uses Java annotations on classes to build database schemas. A big startup performance problem for our package turns out to be the calling of annotation methods under Android 1.6. I see the same behavior up through 3.0.We are seeing that the following simple annotation code is incredibly GC intensive and a real performance problem. 1000 calls to an annotation method takes almost a second on a fast Android device. The same code running on my Macbook Pro can do 28 million (sic) calls in the same time. We have an annotation that has 25 methods in it and we'd like to do more than 50 of these a second.Does anyone know why this is happening and if there is any work around? There are certainly things that ORMLite can do in terms of caching this information but is there anything that we can do to ""fix"" annotations under Android? Thanks. This results in the following log output: EDIT:After @candrews pointed me in the right direction, I did some poking around the code. The performance problem looks to be caused by some terrible, gross code in Method.equals(). It is calling the toString() of both methods and then comparing them.

Doing the .equals by comparing fields would be significantly faster.EDIT:An interesting reflection performance improvement was given to me.

non-recursive serialization," We're getting StackOverflowErrors from Java's serialization library. The problem is that the default serialization implementation is recursive, the depth of which is bounded only by the longest path through a network of references.We realize we could override the default methods but we have hundreds of richly-connected classes in our project so we're not enthusiastic about the override approach. We're more interested if there is a generalized solution that is non-recursive (or at least moves the recursion from the stack to the heap).I googled this topic and found only lots of people bitterly complaining about the same thing but most of these complaints were from many years ago. Has the situation improved? If not and we write a generalized implementation, do you have any advice? We're presuming there is some reason (not yet obvious to us) why no one has cracked this nut. In theory, doing it 'right' sounds like it should be feasible. <code> ",Deep graph results in stack overflow: non-recursive serialization options?

Android: Can I chain Async task sequentially (starting one after the previous asynctask completes)," Every time I do a httpRequest, the screen will appear to be locked up for a few seconds while the code is executing. Hence I used AsyncTask to do all my httpRequest stuff in a separate thread while putting up a ProgressDialog so the user knows something is happening. I recently encountered the following situation: the input of one of my httpRequest is dependent on the result from a previous httpRequest (+parse) action. I can't just put the two AsyncTasks sequentially cause Android will put them in two threads and start the second one without the first one being finished. And without an appropriate input (the result of the first httpRequest), my second httpRequest will crash the app. Is there way I can put-in a wait() to force the second AsyncTask not to start until the first one finishes? <code> ",Can I chain async task sequentially (starting one after the previous asynctask completes)

Prevent browser caching on file downloads with Play?," Part of my app provides a file to be downloaded using the redirect() method. I have found that Chrome (and not Firefox or IE, weirdly) is caching this file so that the same version gets downloaded even if it has changed server-side. I gather that there is a way to tell a browser not to cache a file, e.g. like this in the HTML, or by adding something to the HTTP header. I could probably figure those out in a lower-level web framework, but I don't know how to get at the header in Play!, and the HTML option won't work because it's not an HTML file.It seems like there's always a clever and simple way to do common tasks in Play!, so is there a clever and simple way to prevent caching in a controller?Thanks!Edit:Matt points me to the http.cacheControl setting, which controls caching for the entire site. While this would work, I have no problem with most of the site being cached, especially the CSS etc. If possible I'd like to control caching for one URL at a time (the one pointing to the downloading file in this case). It's not exactly going to be a high-traffic site, so this is just academic interest talking.Ideally, I'd like to do something like: <code>  public static void downloadFile(String url) { response.setCaching(false); // This is the method I'm looking for redirect(url); // Send the response}",How do I prevent browser caching with Play?

"Retrieve Spring Security's Authentication of user, even on public pages with filter=""none"""," Let's say I have a simple page called faq.html. I want this page to be publicly accessible, so I apply the usual Spring Security configuration: Let's also say that if the user reaches this page after authenticating, I want to print ""Hi Firstname Lastname"" on the page. For pages that require authentication, I simply put the result of the following into my ModelMap, and then the names are accessible in my view later: This doesn't work for faq.html, presumably because when you specify filters=""none"", then the call to getPrincipal() returns null. (This behavior makes sense since the configuration causes no filters to be applied.) So, instead it seems that I have to do a bunch of the Spring Security stuff manually: Is there a better way to do this? For example, it seems like Spring should provide some facility for hooking their API calls in via the original <sec:intercept-url /> config. <code>  <sec:intercept-url pattern=""/faq.html"" filters=""none"" /> SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal() public static Authentication authenticate(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, SecurityContextRepository repo, RememberMeServices rememberMeServices) { Authentication auth = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication(); // try to load a previous Authentication from the repository if (auth == null) { SecurityContext context = repo.loadContext( new HttpRequestResponseHolder(request, response)); auth = context.getAuthentication(); } // check for remember-me token if (auth == null) { auth = rememberMeServices.autoLogin(request, response); } return auth;}","Retrieve Spring Security's Authentication, even on public pages with filter=""none"""

In other words, upon click, I'd call a method that generates the file (a Pentaho report in our case), puts it in a temp place and returns a File pointing to it. Then I'd tell the DownloadLink to use that File. Question is, is this possible somehow? Currently we have something like the code below, which works, but I'm interested in whether DownloadLink could be used instead. (Wicket 1.4.18, if it makes a difference.) <code>  add(new DownloadLink(""downloadButton"", getReportFile(), ""report.pdf"")); <input type=""button"" wicket:id=""downloadButton"" value=""Download"" /> add(new Link<Void>(""downloadButton"") { @Override public void onClick() { IResourceStream resourceStream = new AbstractResourceStreamWriter() { @Override public void write(OutputStream output) { try { reportService.generateReport(output, report); } catch (IOException e) { // ... } } @Override public String getContentType() { return CONTENT_TYPE_PDF; } }; getRequestCycle() .setRequestTarget(new ResourceStreamRequestTarget(resourceStream) .setFileName(""report.pdf"")); }});",How to use Wicket's DownloadLink with a file generated on the fly?

Why doesn't autoboxing overrule varargs when using method overwriting in Java 7?," We have a class LogManager in our Java project which looks like this: When compiling the project with OpenJDK 6 under Debian everytingworks fine.

Web-based Java app calls C++ DLL through JNI; how best to allocate memory?," Basic summary of question is:How do I best optimize my memory allocation to give as much memory to the DLLs I access through JNI as possible?

How to save a JPEG with a higher quality? I'd like to try with higher quality and compare the results. I couldn't find anything in the JavaDoc for ImageIO.write.

Disabling Eclipse autocomplete but keeping autoactivation," I use Eclipse for Java development. I like the auto-activation feature because I can add all the letters and numbers so I can see class members while I'm typing; making it behave similarly to Visual Studio.

Agressive garbage collector strategy," I am running an application that creates and forgets large amounts of objects, the amount of long existing objects does grow slowly, but this is very little compared to short lived objects. This is a desktop application with high availability requirements, it needs to be turned on 24 hours per day. Most of the work is done on a single thread, this thread will just use all CPU it can get its hands.In the past we have seen the following under heavy load:The used heap space slowly goes up as the garbage collector collects less than the amount of memory newly allocated, the used heap size slowly grows and eventually comes near the specified max heap. At that point the garbage collector will kick in heavily and start using a huge amount of resources to prevent going over the max heap size. This slows the application down (easily 10x as slow) and at this point most of times the GC will succeed to clean up the garbage after a few minutes or fail and throw an OutOfMemoryException, both of them are not really acceptable. The hardware used is a quad core processor with at least 4GB of memory running 64 bit Linux, all of that we can use if needed. Currently the application is heavily using a single core, which is using most of its time running a single core/thread. The other cores are mostly idle and could be used for garbage collection. I have a feeling the garbage collector should be collecting more aggressively at an early stage, well before it runs out of memory. Our application does not have any throughput issues, low pause time requirements are a bit more important than throughput, but far less important than not getting near the max heap size. It is acceptable if the single busy thread runs at only 75% of the current speed, as long as it means the garbage collector can keep up with the creation. So in short, a steady decrease of performance is better than the sudden drop we see now. I have read Java SE 6 HotSpot[tm] Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning thoroughly, which means I understand the options well, however I still find it hard to chose the right settings as my requirements are a bit different from what is discussed in the paper.Currently I am using the ParallelGC with the option -XX:GCTimeRatio=4. This works a bit better than the default setting for time ratio, but I have a feeling the GC is allowed to run more by that setting than it does. For monitoring I am using jconsole and jvisualvm mostly. I would like to know what garbage collection options you recommend for the above situation. Also which GC debug output can I look at to understand the bottle neck better.EDIT:I understand a very good option here is to create less garbage, this is something we are really considering, however I would like to know how we can tackle this with GC tuning, as that is something we can do much more easily and roll out more quickly than changing large amounts of the source code. Also I have ran the different memory profilers and I understand what the garbage is used by, and there by I know it consists of objects that could be collected. I am using: With JVM parameters: Edit in reply to Matts comments:Most memory (and cpu) goes towards constructing objects that represent the current situation. Some of these will be discarded right away as the situation changes rapidly, some others will have a medium life time if no updates come in for a while.  <code>  java version ""1.6.0_27-ea""Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_27-ea-b03)Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.2-b03, mixed mode) -Xmx1024M and -XX:GCTimeRatio=4 ",Aggressive garbage collector strategy

Java Generics: Array contining generics," Possible Duplicate: Java how to: Generic Array creation Error generic array creation I have been tasked with writing a Hash Table in Java, which must work with any data type. The rules on the code I am writing are as follows:- The hash table must have an array as the underlying data structures, of a size determined at the time the object is constructed- When a collision occurs, the element that collides should be placed into a linked list, which holds all of the elements at that index (key) in the hash tableThus, for the underlying data type, I have made an array of type LinkedList (custom, not the Java API LinkedList). The issue is, of course, instantiating this array. Here are some of my attempts: This throws a compile-time generic array creation error. That causes a ClassCastException error at runtime (java.lang.Object cannot be cast to LinkedList).The person heading the project is also unsure of how to deal with this issue. Is there any way I can change my code so that the hash table still has an array as its underlying data structure with the collisions being placed in a LinkedList? <code>  private LinkedList<T>[] table; public HashTable(int size) { table = new LinkedList<T>[size];} public HashTable(int size) { table = (LinkedList<T>[])(new Object[size]);}",Java Generics: Array containing generics

wsimport - how to generate service endpoint classes and JAXB classes in seperate projects/folders," We are using a top-down approach for a project with multiple web services (multiple WSDL's). Each web service needs to be set up as a separate project and deployed as a separate war. The problem is that the WSDL's share a few common .xsd files. Currently if we run wsimport for each WSDL, the common JAXB classes are being duplicated in each web service project. Ideally we would want to generate the JAXB classes separately in a common shared project, and then reuse the JAXB classes project in each of the web service projects, but wsimport does not provide the option to skip the JAXB class generation OR to specify a different location for the JAXB classes. Any thoughts on how I can share the JAXB classes between different JAX-WS web service endpoints? <code> ",wsimport - how to generate service endpoint classes and JAXB classes in separate projects/folders

How to accurately read mime data from a file?," I'm adding some functionality to a program so that I can accurately determine the files type by reading the MIME data. I've already tried a few methods:Method 1: Method 2: Method 3: I found these three methods at http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0487.html. However my problem is that the file I am testing these methods on is one I created and so I know it's an Excel file, but still all three methods are incorrectly picking up the type as msword except the first method which I believe is because of the limited number of file types in the built in FileTypeMap that the method uses.I've had a look around and some people say that it's because the way the offset is detected in the files and so the content type is picked up incorrectly, as pointed out in this wiki on detecting file types in PHP. Unfortunately the wiki then goes on to use the extension to determine the file type which isn't what I want to do as it's unreliable.Can anyone point me in the right direction to a method that will detect the file types correctly within Java please?Cheers,Alexei Blue.Edit: Looks like there is no specific solution to this as @IronMensan said in the comment below. I did find this really interesting research paper that applies machine learning in a few ways to help the issue but there doesn't seem to be a full proof answer.

I hope I'm being clear on what I need, let me know if I am not and I'll try to explain in another way. <code>  InputStream is = uploadedFile.getInputStream(); byte[] buffer = new byte[(int) uploadedFile.getSize()];is.read(buffer); File f = new File(""C:\\temp\\"" + this.patient.getPk() + "".jpeg""); f.createNewFile(); FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(f); fos.write(buffer); //This is where I write it to the C Drivefos.close();is.close(); ",How I save and retrieve an image on my server in a java webapp

Disabling error message dialog when running eclipse in headless mode?," I'm trying to execute JUnit-tests through a headless Eclipse in our build process. The unit tests are invoked from an Ant script, with this command:eclipsec.exe -noSplash -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner -data ""C:\SomeDirectory"" -buildfile ""C:\Path\To\tests.xml""This works fine, unless the Ant script needs to fail for any reason (either via an explicit task because a unit test failed, or because a unit test threw an exception upstream). In either case, eclipsec raises a dialog box to report that ""An error has occurred."" This is accompanied by an exception. The top of the stack trace, if it is relevant, is: I don't really care what the Ant script or Eclipse fails for -- that's what logging is for --, but the dialog box that pops up along with it is unacceptable, because it hangs our continuous integration system while it waits for the invisible user to come click on it.Is there any way that this dialog box can be suppressed?

Thread priorities in a thread pool (problems in different OS)," I am working on a project that is both memory and computationally intensive. A significant portion of the execution utilizes multi-threading by a FixedThreadPool. In short; I have 1 thread for fetching data from several remote locations (using URL connections) and populating a BlockingQueue with objects to be analyzed and n threads that pick these objects and run the analysis. edit: see code belowNow this setup works like a charm on my Linux machine running OpenSUSE 11.3, but a colleague is testing it on a very similar machine running Win7 is getting custom notifications of timeouts on the queue polling (see code below), lots of them actually. I have been trying to monitor the processor use on her machine, and it appears that the software does not get any more than 15% of the CPUs while on my machine the processor usage hits the roof, just as I intended. My question is, then, can this be a sign of ""starvation"" of the queue? Could it be so that the producer thread is not getting enough cpu time? If so how do I go about giving one particular thread in the pool higher priority?UPDATE:I have been trying to pinpoint the problem, with no joy... I did however gain some new insights. Profiling the execution of the code with JVisualVM demonstrates a very peculiar behavior. The methods are called in short bursts of CPU-time with several seconds of no progress in between. This to me means that somehow the OS is hitting the brakes on the process.Disabling the anti-virus and back-up daemons do not have any significant affect on the matterChanging the priority of java.exe (the only instance) through task manager (adviced here) does not change anything either. (That being said, I could not give ""realtime"" priority to java, and had to be content with ""high"" prio) Profiling the network usage shows good flow of data in and out, so I am guessing that is not the bottleneck (while it is a considerable part of the execution time of the process, but that I know already and is pretty much the same percentage as what I get on my Linux machine).Any ideas as to how the Win7 OS might be limiting the cpu time to my project? if it's not the OS, what could be the limiting factor? I would like to stress yet again that the machine is NOT running any other computation intensive at the same time and there is almost no load on the cpus other than my software. This is driving me crazy...EDIT: relevant code The class QueryingAction is a simple Runnable that calls the data acquisition method in the designated QueryService object which then populates a BlockingQueue.

"Why would i = i + l compile, where i is int and l is long?"," I spotted Java's +=, -=, *=, /= compound assignment operators (good question :)), but it had a part that I don't quite understand. Borrowing from that question: Then i = i + l; will not compile but i += l; will compile fine.The accepted answer to the linked question states that: A compound assignment expression of the form E1 op= E2 is equivalent to E1 = (T)((E1) op (E2)), where T is the type of E1, except that E1 is evaluated only once.which gives that i += l; is the same as i = (int)((i) + (l)); with the exception that i is only evaluated once.A long may be (IIRC even is guaranteed to be) longer than an int, and thus can hold a much greater range of values.Given that this situation can very easily cause data loss due to necessary narrowing conversion at some point during execution of the statement (either r-value expression evaluation, or assignment), why is i += l; not a compile-time error or at least warning? <code>  int i = 5;long l = 8;","Why would i+=l compile, where i is int and l is long?"

How to Optimize Java Backend with Load Testing," Edit: Of the several extremely generous and helpful responses this question has already received, it is obvious to me that I didn't make an important part of this question clear when I asked it earlier this morning. The answers I've received so far are more about optimizing applications & removing bottlenecks at the code level. I am aware that this is way more important than trying to get an extra 3- or 5% out of your JVM!This question assumes we've already done just about everything we could to optimize our application architecture at the code level. Now we want more, and the next place to look is at the JVM level and garbage collection; I've changed the question title accordingly. Thanks again!We've got a ""pipeline"" style backend architecture where messages pass from one component to the next, with each component performing different processes at each step of the way.Components live inside of WAR files deployed on Tomcat servers. Altogether we have about 20 components in the pipeline, living on 5 different Tomcat servers (I didn't choose the architecture or the distribution of WARs for each server). We use Apache Camel to create all the routes between the components, effectively forming the ""connective tissue"" of the pipeline.I've been asked to optimize the GC and general performance of each server running a JVM (5 in all). I've spent several days now reading up on GC and performance tuning, and have a pretty good handle on what each of the different JVM options do, how the heap is organized, and how most of the options affect the overall performance of the JVM.My thinking is that the best way to optimize each JVM is not to optimize it as a standalone. I ""feel"" (that's about as far as I can justify it!) that trying to optimize each JVM locally without considering how it will interact with the other JVMs on other servers (both upstream and downstream) will not produce a globally-optimized solution.To me it makes sense to optimize the entire pipeline as a whole. So my first question is: does SO agree, and if not, why?To do this, I was thinking about creating a LoadTester that would generate input and feed it to the first endpoint in the pipeline. This LoadTester might also have a separate ""Monitor Thread"" that would check the last endpoint for throughput. I could then do all sorts of processing where we check for average end-to-end travel time for messages, maximum throughput before faulting, etc.The LoadTester would generate the same pattern of input messages over and over again. The variable in this experiment would be the JVM options passed to each Tomcat server's startup options. I have a list of about 20 different options I'd like to pass the JVMs, and figured I could just keep tweaking their values until I found near-optimal performance.This may not be the absolute best way to do this, but it's the best way I could design with what time I've been given for this project (about a week).Second question: what does SO think about this setup? How would SO create an ""optimizing solution"" any differently?Last but not least, I'm curious as to what sort of metrics I could use as a basis of measure and comparison. I can really only think of:Find the JVM option config that produces the fastest average end-to-end travel time for messagesFind the JVM option config that produces the largest volume throughput without crashing any of the serversAny others? Any reasons why those 2 are bad?After reviewing the play I could see how this might be construed as a monolithic question, but really what I'm asking is how SO would optimize JVMs running along a pipeline, and to feel free to cut-and-dice my solution however you like it.Thanks in advance! <code> ",How to Optimize JVM & GC through Load Testing

Maven: Detailed (download) Statistics for artifacts of public repositories like maven.org," In former days project hosting sites like sourceforge.org provided detailled (download) statistics for every project. This was helpful to me as a user for finding projects that are more popular (and therefore more ""secure"" and futureproof). But I think this was also important for the developers of those projects.I am new to Maven and have not found any comparable statistics, only the ""Quick Stats"" on Maven Central.

Spring: Can I ignore BeanCreationException and inject null instead?," We have a situation where our Spring wires up some beans that include ActiveMQ classes built with Java 6. Our application runs on customer's servers, so we can't guarantee that they have Java 6 or later installed. If they happen to have Java 5, the application can't start because of BeanCreationExceptions with the classes that depend on ActiveMQ (root cause being a UnsupportedClassVersionError).So my question is, is there any way to ignore a BeanCreationException and still start the application? I want to be able to display an error message saying that they need to install Java 6 or later, but since the application can't even start, I never have a chance to do this.My hunch is that there is no way to do this, because Spring needs to be able to guarantee that my application is built properly after initialization, but I thought I would ask anyway. Any other suggestions for how to accomplish my end goal would also be helpful and appreciated.We are using Spring 3.0.6Thanks! <code> ",Can I ignore BeanCreationException and inject null instead?

How encapsulation is different from abstraction as oops concet in java?," Here are the brief definitions of encapsulation and abstraction.Abstraction: The process of abstraction in Java is used to hide certain details and only show the essential features of the object.

The only good example i see for this across different sites is interface.Encapsulation: Its basically about hiding the state of object with the help of modifiers like private,public,protected etc. we expose the state thru public methods only if require.What we achieve with modifiers like private, public also hides unnecessary details from out side world which is nothing but also a abstraction conceptSo, from above explanation looks like encapsulation is a part of abstraction or we can say it's a subset of abstraction. But why then encapsulation term is invented when we could deal it with abstraction only? I am sure there should be some major difference which distinguishes them but most of material on net says almost same thing for both of them.Though this question has been raised on this forum earlier too but I am posting it again with specific doubts.

Advantages to using Hibernate Callback?," I am not able to understand advantages of using Hibernate Callback method, are there any advantages or specific use case where we should go for it. Also one more important question is that does HibernateCallback method close session everytime after query returns values? I have use case where am calling this function multiple times on every refresh of status page and so will it everytime open session and query database or will it store query results in memory and then everytime I make call to this function, results would be popped out from memory. I have read(Reference):The spring HibernateTemplate.execute() by default closes any open sessions upon completion. When used with lazy initialization you may get a LazyInitializationException like the following org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no SessionAny reference to relevant documentation part would be highly appreciated. Update:In my case am using ejb transactions and setting it to ""support"" and i believe in that case as transaction is set to support, it's optional and so everytime new session will be created and hibernate will query database to get results and so that's were am having bottleneck, will that an right assumptions to make? <code>  public List findRecentRequests(final int offset, final int length){ List list = getHibernateTemplate().executeFind(new HibernateCallback() { public Object doInHibernate(Session session) throws HibernateException { Query q = session.createQuery(FIND_RECENT_REQUESTS); q.setFirstResult(offset); q.setMaxResults(length); return q.list(); } }); return list;}",Advantages of using Hibernate Callback?

I know that it is a best practice to close only those resources that you open so this seems wrong.The inputstream is not repeatable.

It made me feel that I'm not completely alone in my efforts to learn Java. Please excuse me, but I guess I didn't clarify enough what I don't get about linked lists and the exercise application - first - how can a class definition contain an object of itself, OK I know that this is recursion but it's still a very strange and alien concept to me.second - how exactly can a linked list object ""link"" to another node?third - if two objects are separated by an equals sign it means what - that the second object disappears and what's left of it is it's ""name"" that now points to the first object or vice versa? then - the thing that I don't get about the program I quoted below is the following: after the linkList class is instantiated it's constructor is called and it gives the object of class Link private Link first the value of null, i.e. sets it pointing to nothing. Then, when the first new node is created the method public void insertFirst is called, it gives the object values to its variables and then something absurd happens - the object first that points to nothing is assigned to the new item thus making both objects pointing to nothing and with the first = newLink; I'm completely lost...I'm doing a college course on Algorithms and Data structures and since the professor is really mean and his explanations are useless I'm trying to learn on my own from a book called Algorithms and data structures by Robert Lafore.

"Java - High CPU, possibly due to context switching?"," One of our servers is experiencing a very high CPU load with our application. We've looked at various stats and are having issues finding the source of the problem.One of the current theories is that there are too many threads involved and that we should try to reduce the number of concurrently executing threads. There's just one main thread pool, with 3000 threads, and a WorkManager working with it (this is Java EE - Glassfish). At any given moment, there are about 620 separate network IO operations that need to be conducted in parallel (use of java.NIO is not an option either). Moreover, there are roughly 100 operations that have no IO involved and are also executed in parallel.This structure is not efficient and we want to see if it is actually causing damage, or is simply bad practice. Reason being that any change is quite expensive in this system (in terms of man hours) so we need some proof of an issue.So now we're wondering if context switching of threads is the cause, given there are far more threads than the required concurrent operations. Looking at the logs, we see that on average there are 14 different threads executed in a given second. If we take into account the existence of two CPUs (see below), then it is 7 threads per CPU. This doesn't sound like too much, but we wanted to verify this.So - can we rule out context switching or too-many-threads as the problem?General Details:Java 1.5 (yes, it's old), running on CentOS 5, 64-bit, Linux kernel 2.6.18-128.el5There is only one single Java process on the machine, nothing else.Two CPUs, under VMware.8GB RAMWe don't have the option of running a profiler on the machine.We don't have the option of upgrading the Java, nor the OS.UPDATEAs advised below, we've conducted captures of load average (using uptime) and CPU (using vmstat 1 120) on our test server with various loads. We've waited 15 minutes between each load change and its measurements to ensure that the system stabilized around the new load and that the load average numbers are updated:50% of the production server's workload: http://pastebin.com/GE2kGLkk34% of the production server's workload: http://pastebin.com/V2PWq8CG25% of the production server's workload: http://pastebin.com/0pxxK0FuCPU usage appears to be reduced as the load reduces, but not on a very drastic level (change from 50% to 25% is not really a 50% reduction in CPU usage).

I want to do this not by setting the java.library.path property directly, but instead by modifying the system path variable that it maps to. I'd like a clean way to do this that doesn't have ugly OS-specific code or leave out edge cases if possible.My question:Is there a way to ask the local Java implementation what environment variable java.library.path maps to?Then, in a shell script, I'd be able to write something along the lines of: <code>  path_var = get_library_path_variable # the magic function I want to call${path_var} = /my/custom/path:${${path_var}}",Can I find out what variable java.library.path maps to on the current platform?

@SecondaryTable doesn't work," I know, @SecondaryTable issues were published numerous times, so, if there is the same one (I haven't found it yet), please, give me the link or an advice. I have two tables in my database (firstTable and secondTable), two POJO Hibernate classes (FirstTablePojo and SecondTablePojo). I want to show fields from both these tables in the jsp from the single list object, I decided to use @SecondaryTable. These two tables are connected by the featureId field (which is a primary key for the secondTable), I want the featureName from the secondTable to be shown along with fields from the firstTable. The FirstTablePojo is preceded by this annotation: I added this property to the FirstTablePojo (with getters and setters): When with a help of <c:forEach items=""${features}"" var=""feature"">, I get each ${feature.foo} (foo is a property that was in the FirstTablePojo before I used @SecondaryTable) and ${feature.featureName}, I see each foo, but none of the featureNames appear. It'd be great if someone could tell me what do I miss here and why feature's names from the other table do not appear in the list of FirstTablePojo objects.  <code>  +----------+ +-----------+|firstTable| |secondTable||----------+ |-----------+|featureId |------------>|featureId |(secondTable's primary key)|foo | |featureName||bar | +-----------++----------+ @SecondaryTable(name=""secondTable"", pkJoinColumns=@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name=""featureId"", referencedColumnName = ""featureId"")) @ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name=""featureId"", table=""secondTable"") String featureName;",Hibernate : @SecondaryTable doesn't work

Java UDP hole punching example," Lets say I have two computers. They know each others public and private IPs via ice4j.One client listening and the other one sending some string. I'd like to see this happen via UPD hole punching: Could any one post pseudo examples of how to go about doing hole punching through symmetric NAT? Assuming there will be server S that will help to guess the port numbers and establish connection between the client A and B.It would be nice if you accounted for double NAT as well. NOTE:You can use STUN to discover the IP and Port but you have to write your own code that would send the IP:Port to your server via keepalive technique. Once one client identifies the other via unique ID on the server it will be provided with the other's client IP:port info to UDP hole punch the data it needs to send and receive.Little update:There is library that is showing up on the horizon for java check it out:https://github.com/htwg/UCE#readme  <code>  Let A be the client requesting the connectionLet B be the client that is responding to the requestLet S be the ice4j STUN server that they contact to initiate the connection--A sends a connection request to SS responds with B's IP and port info, and sends A's IP and port info to BA sends a UDP packet to B, which B's router firewall drops but it stillpunches a hole in A's own firewall where B can connectB sends a UDP packet to A, that both punches a hole in their own firewall,and reaches A through the hole that they punched in their own firewallA and B can now communicate through their established connection without the help of S",Java UDP hole punching example - connecting through firewall
"Changing a Map value. keywords: Map, Structural Modification and concurrency"," I was wondering if synchronization or using a concurrent class is necessary, or conversely is it thread safe to use a non concurrent class and do no synchronization on a map in a multi threaded environment, if the only modification to the map is changing the values of the map.The reason I ask this is the HashMap ( and other non concurrent maps documentation ) have this comment: Note that this implementation is not synchronized. If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.Which makes me believe if the modification is not structural (i.e. There is no added or deleted) I should be able to update the (non concurrent) map sans synchronization.Am I reading this correct? i.e. Is Updating of a value in a map an atomic process? <code> ",Is changing the value of a Map an atomic operation?

Understanding how to scale and limit results of number breakdown algorithm," UPDATE: To help clarify what I'm asking I have posted a little java code that gets the idea across.A while ago I asked a question on how to get an algorithm to break down a set of numbers, the idea was to give it a list of numbers (1,2,3,4,5) and a total(10) and it would figure out all the multiples of each number that would add up to the total('1*10' or '1*1,1*2,1*3,1*4' or '2*5',etc..). It was the first programming exercise I ever did so it took me a while and I got it working but now I want to try to see if I can scale it. The person in the original question said it was scalable but I'm a bit confused at how to do it. The recursive part is the area I'm stuck at scaling the part that combines all the results(the table it is referring to is not scalable but applying caching I am able to make it fast)I have the following algorithm(pseudo code): I'm really at a loss at how to thread/multiprocess the RecursivelyListAllThatWork function. I know if I send it a smaller K( which is int of total number of items in list) it will process that subset but I don't know how to do ones that combine results across the subset. For example, if list is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and I send it K=3 then only the 1,2,3 get processed which is fine but what about if I need results that include 1 and 10? I have tried to modify the table(variable T) so only the subset I want are there but still doesn't work because, like the solution above, it does a subset but cannot process answers that require a wider range.I don't need any code just if someone can explain how to conceptually break this recursive step to so other cores/machines can be used.

Can't seem to understand how to scale/thread recursive function," UPDATE: To help clarify what I'm asking I have posted a little java code that gets the idea across.A while ago I asked a question on how to get an algorithm to break down a set of numbers, the idea was to give it a list of numbers (1,2,3,4,5) and a total(10) and it would figure out all the multiples of each number that would add up to the total('1*10' or '1*1,1*2,1*3,1*4' or '2*5',etc..). It was the first programming exercise I ever did so it took me a while and I got it working but now I want to try to see if I can scale it. The person in the original question said it was scalable but I'm a bit confused at how to do it. The recursive part is the area I'm stuck at scaling the part that combines all the results(the table it is referring to is not scalable but applying caching I am able to make it fast)I have the following algorithm(pseudo code): I'm really at a loss at how to thread/multiprocess the RecursivelyListAllThatWork function. I know if I send it a smaller K( which is int of total number of items in list) it will process that subset but I don't know how to do ones that combine results across the subset. For example, if list is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and I send it K=3 then only the 1,2,3 get processed which is fine but what about if I need results that include 1 and 10? I have tried to modify the table(variable T) so only the subset I want are there but still doesn't work because, like the solution above, it does a subset but cannot process answers that require a wider range.I don't need any code just if someone can explain how to conceptually break this recursive step to so other cores/machines can be used.

How do I implement intelligent drag and drop from one JTREEto another?," I have two JTrees with some mock data in there, what I'm looking to do is to be able to take each 'Job' (15663-1, 15663-2, etc) and make a node for each, with a node for each part underneath it and the components attached to each part underneath that. In two trees, like this: So that supposing I have two screws in the cover in job A in the 'parts to be shipped' jtree and I don't have anything in jobA in the shipping box, when I drag the screws over to the shipping box it should make an entry for jobA, make an entry for part A and make an entry for the component, then I want it to prompt for the quantity for that component and subtract that quantity from the parts to be shipped jtree. So if I have a job called 1553-4 and it has a cover with four screws and I drag the screws into the shipping box then it should make an entry in the shipping box that says, ""x screws"" then prompt for the user to enter the number of screws they just packaged, if they package two screws then the jtree should change to reflect the 2 screws remaining for that job.I have read a bunch of different drag and drop tutorials and I have some examples but I just cannot seem to get it.

What is the fastest way in Java to get the amount of factors a number has," I am trying to write a function in Java that will return the number of factors a specific number has. The following restrictions should be taken into account. It should be done with BigIntegerStoring the previous generated numbers are not allowed, thus more processing and less memory.(You can not use ""Sieve of Atkin"" like in this)Negative numbers can be ignored.This is what I have so far, but it is extremely slow. <code>  public static int getNumberOfFactors(BigInteger number) { // If the number is 1 int numberOfFactors = 1; if (number.compareTo(BigInteger.ONE) <= 0) { return numberOfFactors; } BigInteger boundry = number.divide(new BigInteger(""2"")); BigInteger counter = new BigInteger(""2""); while (counter.compareTo(boundry) <= 0) { if (number.mod(counter).compareTo(BigInteger.ZERO) == 0) { numberOfFactors++; } counter = counter.add(BigInteger.ONE); } // For the number it self numberOfFactors++; return numberOfFactors;}",What is the fastest way in Java to get the amount of prime factors a number has

How to check for repeating sequence in an int," I have an alpha-numeric string and I want to check for pattern repetition in it just for the integers. And they should be continuous. Example12341234qwe should tell me 1234 is repeated.1234qwe1234 should NOT tell me that 1234 is repeated since its not continuous. 12121212 should be treated as 12 being repeated as that is the first set which would be found being repeated. But if there is an algorithm which would find 1212 as the repeated set before 12 then I guess it has to perform the steps again on 1212.What I thought was I can store the integer part by iterating and comparing it with ( <= '0' && >= '9') in a different StringBuilder. Then I read about performing FFT on the string and it shows the repeated patterns. But I have no idea on how to perform FFT in Java and look for the results, also, I was hoping to try to do this without going to Signal Processing. I read about KMP pattern matching but that only works with a given input. Is there any other way to do this? <code> ",How to check for repeating sequence in an integer

RESTEasy: Create Hibernate-Session per Request," I just started a simple Java testproject which manages some entities using Hibernate and provides a REST interface to manipulate these objects and provide some additional business logic. The REST interface is created using RESTEasy and Jetty.Everything works fine so far, but I have the feeling that I'm actually writing too much boilerplate code. As I don't have much experience in these Java frameworks I'm just wondering if anyone could give me a hint on how to improve the situation.Creting Hibernate Sessions per RequestWell, as far as I understood I have to create a Hibernate session per request and at the end I have to close it. So currently all of my service methods look like this: Is there any way to remove these two lines in order to somehow do this automatically?Currently my service is registered as a RestEASY singleton. Will changing to a RESTeasy ressource and creating the session in the constructor solve the problem? I think it will solve the problem of creating the session. But wherer to close it?In C++ this can easily done be creating a scoped object which closes the session at the end. But in Java?Whenever such a REST request is made I have to check for a valid session (the user has to login previously). Is a ServletFilter the right way to do this?General: Are there any other patterns or frameworks I should consider using? I mean I want to keep it as simple as possible and especially as I dont have that much experience I dont want to end up using Spring or whatever heavyweight framework. Seems that I'm used to the simplicity of Python and Django but for this little project I have to use Java.THanks so far! <code>  Session session = HibernateUtil.getInstance().getSessionFactory().openSession();.........session.close();",Create Hibernate-Session per Request

"In Java, why would iterating over a List be faster than indexing through it?"," Reading the Java documentation for the ADT List it says: The List interface provides four methods for positional (indexed) access to list elements. Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based. Note that these operations may execute in time proportional to the index value for some implementations (the LinkedList class, for example). Thus, iterating over the elements in a list is typically preferable to indexing through it if the caller does not know the implementation.What exactly does this mean? I don't understand the conclusion which is drawn. <code> ",Why would iterating over a List be faster than indexing through it?

convert dtd to xsd with defined root (staring) element," I have several large DTD files. I've used trang to convert them into XSD files, so I could easily use it from JAXB and other utilities. However, the generated XSD file has all declared elements at the top level. It means that any element could be root element of an input XML. I want to specify only a particular element.Having these multiple root elements causes a few problems, e.g. xjc generates @XmlRootElement for all classes, so I need to add more additional checks.As I understand, I need to rewrite the generated XSD, moving <xs:element>s to <xs:complexType>s, changing element refs into element types and so on, but this would be too much monkey work, with no way to verify if all done correctly.Is there a more efficient way to do this? <code> ",Convert DTD to XSD with defined root (starting) element

How should I construct booleans and access them with java/oracle stored proc," First time using Oracle, normally use SQLServer, and ran into a curious issue.I was tearing my hair out with this problem, and trying random things and one happened to work.So originally, I had only two parameters, and everything worked fine. I then wished to add a boolean value to allow for multiple paths in my stored proc. I test it out in my db environment, and there are no errors and I get back the data I expect. I then add the few lines in my java code to pull this data, and suddenly I get ""wrong number or types of parameters"" error. After trying several things, I simply change the type in Oracle from Boolean to Int, leaving the java code still as ""setBoolean(3, true)"" and everything works.So my questions are: 1) what am I sending with this setBoolean() on the java side, and what is Oracle getting?2) what was it expecting before when it was of type ""Boolean, and why is this not compatible with setBoolean()?""3) Should I use Oracle type int with java setBoolean(), or some other combination such as Oracle Varchar, and setString(), when going for speed?Java: Oracle SP(previous): Oracle changed to: <code>  String jobquery = ""{call PKG_TEST.GET_PLAN_DATA(?,?,?)}""; CallableStatement callStmt = con.prepareCall(jobquery); callStmt.setString(1,""15105""); callStmt.setString(2, """"); callStmt.setBoolean(3, true); PROCEDURE GET_PLAN_DATA( NAME_N_IN IN VARCHAR2, TYPE_C_IN IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL, ONLY_RESTRICTIONS_IN IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE) PROCEDURE GET_PLAN_DATA( NAME_N_IN IN VARCHAR2, TYPE_C_IN IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL, ONLY_RESTRICTIONS_IN IN INT DEFAULT 0)",How to construct booleans and access them with java/oracle stored proc

Applets - Cookie and Cache Sharing?," Is there any interaction between applets and their hosting browser when making HTTP requests, or are requests made completely independently of native browser code?Specifically, do Java applets running in a browser have some implicit way of sharing the browser's session state and cache?I've read a few posts from non-authoritative sources saying that when an applet makes an HTTP request that it will use the browser's cache, and that it will also have access (somehow) to the browser's cookies.Tests I've done using URLConnection suggest that this is not the case, and my gut feeling is that it sounds far too convenient to be true. I would assume that nothing in the JVM knows anything about the world outside of that JVM, meaning the only other way this could work would be if the JVM implementation is specific to the browser its implementation of the URL-related methods delegate to native browser code?If cookie data is not implicitly shared or available, is best practice to pass a session ID in a param tag to the applet? Are there security concerns with this approach? If the applet doesn't use the browser's cache for requests, how does caching requests in an applet work? <code> ",Do Applets use Browser for HTTP Requests?

MQ how to achieve C like multithreading," In C we have Sockets and descriptors, it is possible to just take one of these and hand them over to a Thread, this makes it possible that you can accept incoming connections and give the work to a Thread you like and the Thread can send by itself the response back. My question is, how can I achieve this with ZeroMQ? With Request-Reply pattern it seems i cannot send and receive asynchronously, the responses have to be in sequence, my goal would be to have multiple clients to a single server, sending responses not in sequence.I had a look at the Request Response pattern but the API clearly states that using that Socket with multiple Threads is a bad idea. Maybe i have missed something or ZeroMQ is more intelligent than i know of. If you need any further information just post a comment and i will do my best to give the information.I had also a look at the provided examples: Code ExamplesHere is the Socket description: ZMQ-Socket <code> ",ZeroMQ: how to achieve C-like multithreading

Don't get it. Why not JUL?," For the first time in my life I find myself in a position where I'm writing a Java API that will be open sourced. Hopefully to be included in many other projects.For logging I (and indeed the people I work with) have always used JUL (java.util.logging) and never had any issues with it. However now I need to understand in more detail what I should do for my API development. I've done some research on this and with the information I've got I just get more confused. Hence this post.Since I come from JUL I'm biased on that. My knowledge of the rest is not that big.From the research I've done I've come up with these reasons why people do not like JUL:""I started developing in Java long before Sun released JUL and it was just easier for me to continue with logging-framework-X rather than to learn something new"". Hmm. I'm not kidding, this is actually what people say. With this argument we could all be doing COBOL. (however I can certainly relate to this being a lazy dude myself)""I don't like the names of the logging levels in JUL"". Ok, seriously, this is just not enough of a reason to introduce a new dependency.""I don't like the standard format of the output from JUL"". Hmm. This is just configuration. You do not even have to do anything code-wise. (true, back in old days you may have had to create your own Formatter class to get it right).""I use other libraries that also use logging-framework-X so I thought it easier just to use that one"". This is a circular argument, isn't ? Why does 'everybody' use logging-framework-X and not JUL?""Everybody else is using logging-framework-X"". This to me is just a special case of the above. Majority is not always right.So the real big question is why not JUL?. What is it I have missed ? The raison d'tre for logging facades (SLF4J, JCL) is that multiple logging implementations have existed historically and the reason for that really goes back to the era before JUL as I see it. If JUL was perfect then logging facades wouldn't exist, or what? To make matters more confusing JUL is to some extent a facade itself, allowing Handlers, Formatters and even the LogManager to be swapped.Rather than embracing multiple ways of doing the same thing (logging), shouldn't we question why they were necessary in the first place? (and see if those reasons still exist)Ok, my research so far has led to a couple of things that I can see may be real issues with JUL:Performance. Some say that performance in SLF4J is superior to the rest. This seems to me to be a case of premature optimization. If you need to log hundreds of megabytes per second then I'm not sure you are on the right path anyway. JUL has also evolved and the tests you did on Java 1.4 may no longer be true. You can read about it here and this fix has made it into Java 7. Many also talk about the overhead of string concatenation in logging methods. However template based logging avoids this cost and it exist also in JUL. Personally I never really write template based logging. Too lazy for that. For example if I do this with JUL: my IDE will warn me and ask permission that it should change it to: .. which I will of course accept. Permission granted ! Thank you for your help.So I don't actually write such statements myself, that is done by the IDE.In conclusion on the issue of performance I haven't found anything that would suggest that JUL's performance is not ok compared to the competition.Configuration from classpath. Out-of-the-box JUL cannot load a configuration file from the classpath. It is a few lines of code to make it do so. I can see why this may be annoying but the solution is short and simple.Availability of output handlers. JUL comes with 5 output handlers out-of-the-box: console, file stream, socket and memory. These can be extended or new ones can be written. This may for example be writing to UNIX/Linux Syslog and Windows Event Log. I have personally never had this requirement nor have I seen it used but I can certainly relate to why it may be a useful feature. Logback comes with an appender for Syslog for example. Still I would argue that99.5% of the needs for output destinations are covered by what is in JUL out-of-the-box.Special needs could be catered for by custom handlers on top of JUL rather than on top of something else. There's nothing to me that suggests that it takes more time to write a Syslog output handler for JUL than it does for another logging framework.I'm really concerned that there's something I've overlooked. The use of logging facades and logging implementations other than JUL is so widespread that I have to come to the conclusion that it's me who just doesn't understand. That wouldn't be the first time, I'm afraid. :-)So what should I do with my API? I want it to become successful. I can of course just ""go with the flow"" and implement SLF4J (which seems the most popular these days) but for my own sake I still need to understand exactly what is wrong with the JUL of today that warrants all the fuzz? Will I sabotage myself by choosing JUL for my library ?Testing performance(section added by nolan600 on 07-JUL-2012)There's a reference below from Ceki about SLF4J's parametrization being 10 times or more faster than JUL's. So I've started doing some simple tests. At first glance the claim is certainly correct. Here are the preliminary results (but read on!):Execution time SLF4J, backend Logback: 1515Execution time SLF4J, backend JUL: 12938Execution time JUL: 16911The numbers above are msecs so less is better. So 10 times performance difference is by first actually pretty close. My initial reaction: That is a lot !Here is the core of the test. As can be seen an integer and a string is construted in a loop which is then used in the log statement: (I wanted the log statement to have both a primitive data type (in this case an int) and a more complex data type (in this case a String). Not sure it matters but there you have it.)The log statement for SLF4J: The log statement for JUL: The JVM was 'warmed up' with the same test executed once before the actual measurement was done. Java 1.7.03 was used on Windows 7. Latest versions of SLF4J (v1.6.6) and Logback (v1.0.6) was used. Stdout and stderr was redirected to null device.However, careful now, it turns out JUL is spending most of its time in getSourceClassName() because JUL by default prints the source class name in the output, while Logback doesn't. So we are comparing apples and oranges. I have to do the test again and configure the logging implementations in a similar manner so that they actually output the same stuff. I do however suspect that SLF4J+Logback will still come out on top but far from the initial numbers as given above. Stay tuned.Btw: The test was first time I've actually worked with SLF4J or Logback. A pleasant experience. JUL is certainly a lot less welcoming when you are starting out.Testing performance (part 2)(section added by nolan600 on 08-JUL-2012)As it turns out it doesn't really matter for performance how you configure your pattern in JUL, i.e. whether or not it includes the source name or not. I tried with a very simple pattern: and that did not change the above timings at all. My profiler revealed that the logger still spent a lot of time in calls to getSourceClassName() even if this was not part of my pattern. The pattern doesn't matter.I'm therefore concluding on the issue of performance that at least for the tested template based log statement there seems to be roughly a factor of 10 in real performance difference between JUL (slow) and SLF4J+Logback (quick). Just like Ceki said.I can also see another thing namely that SLF4J's getLogger() call is a lot more expensive than JUL's ditto. (95 ms vs 0.3 ms if my profiler is accurate). This makes sense. SLF4J has to do some time on the binding of the underlying logging implementation. This doesn't scare me. These calls should be somewhat rare in the lifetime of an application. The fastness should be in the actual log calls.Final conclusion(section added by nolan600 on 08-JUL-2012)Thank you for all your answers. Contrary to what I initially thought I've ended up deciding to use SLF4J for my API. This is based on a number of things and your input:It gives flexibility to choose log implementation at deployment time.Issues with lack of flexibility of JUL's configuration when run inside an application server.SLF4J is certainly a lot faster as detailed above in particular if you couple it with Logback. Even if this was just a rough test I have reason to believe that a lot more effort has gone into optimization on SLF4J+Logback than on JUL.Documentation. The documentation for SLF4J is simply a lot more comprehensive and precise.Pattern flexibility. As I did the tests I set out to have JUL mimic the default pattern from Logback. This pattern includes the name of the thread. It turns out JUL cannot do this out of the box. Ok, I haven't missed it until now, but I don't think it is a thing that should be missing from a log framework. Period!Most (or many) Java projects today use Maven so adding a dependency is not that big a thing especially if that dependency is rather stable, i.e. doesn't constantly change its API. This seems to be true for SLF4J. Also the SLF4J jar and friends are small in size.So the strange thing that happened was that I actually got quite upset with JUL after having worked a bit with SLF4J. I still regret that it has to be this way with JUL. JUL is far from perfect but kind of does the job. Just not quite well enough. The same can be said about Properties as an example but we do not think about abstracting that so people can plug in their own configuration library and what have you. I think the reason is that Properties comes in just above the bar while the opposite is true for JUL of today ... and in the past it came in at zero because it didn't exist. <code>  log.finest(""Lookup request from username="" + username + "", valueX="" + valueX + "", valueY="" + valueY)); log.log(Level.FINEST, ""Lookup request from username={0}, valueX={1}, valueY={2}"", new Object[]{username, valueX, valueY}); for (int i = 0; i < noOfExecutions; i++) { for (char x=32; x<88; x++) { String someString = Character.toString(x); // here we log } } logger.info(""Logging {} and {} "", i, someString); logger.log(Level.INFO, ""Logging {0} and {1}"", new Object[]{i, someString}); java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=""%4$s: %5$s [%1$tc]%n""",Why not use java.util.logging?

How does LCP help in finding the number of occurences of a pattern?," I have read that the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) could be used to find the number of occurrences of a pattern in a string.Specifically, you just need to create the suffix array of the text, sort it, and then instead of doing binary search to find the range so that you can figure out the number of occurrences, you simply compute the LCP for each successive entry in the suffix array.Although using binary search to find the number of occurrences of a pattern is obvious I can't figure out how the LCP helps find the number of occurrences here. For example for this suffix array for banana: How does the LCP help find the number of occurrences of a substring like ""banana"" or ""na"" is not obvious to me.Any help figuring out how LCP helps here? <code>  LCP Suffix entryN/A a 1 ana 3 anana 0 banana 0 na 2 nana ",How does LCP help in finding the number of occurrences of a pattern?
Java Pattern Matcher: create new or reset()?," Assume a Regular Expression, which, via a Java Matcher object, is matched against a large number of strings: In the Java SE 6 JavaDoc for Matcher, one finds the option of reusing the same Matcher object, via the reset(CharSequence) method, which, as the source code shows, is a bit less expensive than creating a new Matcher every time, i.e., unlike above, one could do: Should one use the reset(CharSequence) pattern above, or should they prefer to initialize a new Matcher object every time? <code>  String expression = ...; // The Regular ExpressionPattern pattern = Pattern.compile(expression);String[] ALL_INPUT = ...; // The large number of strings to be matchedMatcher matcher; // Declare but not initialize a Matcherfor (String input:ALL_INPUT){ matcher = pattern.matcher(input); // Create a new Matcher if (matcher.matches()) // Or whatever other matcher check { // Whatever processing }} String expression = ...; // The Regular ExpressionPattern pattern = Pattern.compile(expression);String[] ALL_INPUT = ...; // The large number of strings to be matchedMatcher matcher = pattern.matcher(""""); // Declare and initialize a matcherfor (String input:ALL_INPUT){ matcher.reset(input); // Reuse the same matcher if (matcher.matches()) // Or whatever other matcher check { // Whatever processing }}",Java Pattern Matcher: create new or reset?
Preventing java class unload?," I have a test class extending junit.framework.TestCase with several test methods.Each method opens a HTTP connection to server and exchange request and response json strings.One method gets a response with a string called UID(similar to sessionId) which i need to use in subsequent requests to the server.I was previously writing that string to a file and my next requests read that file for string.I am running one method at a time.Now I am trying to use that string without file operations.I maintained a hastable(because there are many UIDs to keep track of) in my test class as instance variable for the purpose , but eventually found that class is getting loaded for my each method invocation as my static block is executing everytime.This is causing the loss of those UIDs.How do I achieve this without writing to file and reading from it?I doubt whether my heading matches my requirement.Someone please edit it accordingly. <code> ",How do I share state between JUnit tests?

And to add years from an int, 'years' has to be an int as well. <code>  PrintStream out = System.out; Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); out.print(""Enter a number ... ""); int n = in.nextInt();",Adding Years to a random date from Date class
what's the difference between Serialization and simply store the object on disk?," I am confused about this.Since when doing implementation of Serializable class, we need to use classes like FileOutputStream, ObjectOutputStream or something like that. Then why not we just use those classes to do things like output a object to a file and input a object from a file to maintain the status of a object directly? Why should we first implement Serializable and then do the same thing? <code> ",What's the difference between Serialization and simply store the object on disk?

Sending HashMap paramater to Web Service from PHP," Actually, the problem is NOT how to do it, but if it's a design mistake. I'm worried because I've read a lot about using only standard data types in WS. However, I had no problem implementing one that receives a HashMap, and filling that parameter from PHP with nuSoap.I have a ParameterBean class with this members (plus getters and setters of course), which includes a HashMap. And a service that receives an instance from this class. Then from the PHP client I invoke: It works like a charm! Question is: Is this frowned upon? Will this result in a headache in the future in some way? <code>  private int ID;private String value;private String name;private HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<Integer, String>(); $map = array(1 => 'Foo', 2 => 'Bar');$paramsp = array( 'ID' => '1', 'value' => 'Some Value', 'name' => 'A Name', 'map' => $map);$params = array($paramsp);$resp = $client->call('test',$params);print_r($client->response);",Sending HashMap parameter to Web Service from PHP
Traveling_Salesman_Problem - Brute force algorithm - java," I'm working on a project for a math class at school, and I chose to do mine on the Traveling Salesman Problem, something I've always wanted to investigate more.However, I'm having problems with my brute force solving algorithm.*Please go to the update at the bottom to view the most recent version of the codeSKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM IS:To summarize as much as possible, the TSP goes like this: You are a salesman who wants to visit each city in a region (a city is essentially a point on a map). There are 'n' cities in the bounded x and y region, and each city is connected to each city (by assume a straight road). You need to find the shortest possible route among the cities that allows you to visit each city.One of the algorithms I want to use (and I will need to test other algorithms) is Brute Force, which checks every possible route and returns the shortest route. The reason this is not always used is because it requires us to check (n-1)! possible routes, and that number gets huge as 'n' increases- in fact, with just 50 cities, that would be 608281864034267560872252163321295376887552831379210240000000000 routes to check.ASSUME FOR ALL EXAMPLES TALKED ABOUT IN THIS POST THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE USING AN ARBITRARY REGION WITH 4 CITIES (even though the algorithm can handle n cities. also we don't care about distances- we want to hit every possible route in brute force).Here is a simple picture demoing what I'm talking about (4 cities is what I'm starting with to check if the process is working properly)picture of map with citiesHere is the Brute Force algorithm (assume all other called methods work correctly, because they do):(check below for a bit more explanation)[code] Here is my logic:(Note: a city object has a ""flag"" boolean variable called ""visited"") (if all routes are not flagged, and if the route doesn't contain each possible city)begin with route with 1 unflagged city. flag the ""last unflagged"" city (this city is ""pivot"") Find each city that is ""NOT IN ROUTE R"", and add it to a new route. recursively call the BruteForce method on each of these routes.(if all routes are not flagged, but the route contains each city)flag the last city(else... this means the route has each city flagged and contains each possible city)see if this is the shortest route- if it is, store it in global variableThis image will help me explain the problem...So the program correctly goes down the left side. However, after it gets to the bottom, one would expect the recursion to jump back up to step4, which it does. However, instead of R having city A flagged and city B unflagged and then recursively calling itself on the ""new route"" containing Aflag and B, R now has all 4 cities included, and all 4 are flagged. It fails because it adds city D again to ""newRoute"", recursively calls itself again, and in another method we get an array out of bounds error because there aren't 5 cities in my region, but there incorrectly are 5 cities in route r (A,B,C,D,D).

If power failes in Online examination then how do we update the time left when he again log in to the portal?," I am working on a project Online examination just to gain knowledge. There can be a case of power failure and when a candidate logs in again, then the time wasted during power failure must be given. But in my javascript code, the exam ends after exact 2 hours corresponding to server time(AJAX is used here). After time ends, the student is redirected to home page. I have thought of a solution but I dont find a start to implement it. As the session is maintained, so I can maintain the time he used from 2 hours and can be stored in database. when he relogin then that particular row which corresponds to him can be checked and the time can be updated.But I am not able to implement it. Please tell me if there is another solution to it or the direction in which I am thinking is right or wrong. The exam clock resumes from the start of 2 hours. It doesn't resume from the time which was ticking when the power failure was there. Its the same thing whether a power failure occurs or a candidate logs back again in this case atleast. And I am not asking for any code for this problem. I just want a hint or a direction in which I can think of. I just want to know what can be the concept behind it. <code> ","If  power failure occurs during an online examination, how do we update the time left when the user logs in to the portal again?"

Find the largest possible difference in an array with the smaller integer occuring earlier," This is an interview question: Find the largest possible difference in an array of integers, such that the smaller integer occurs earlier in the array.Constraint:Numbers are not unique.The range is Integer range of java. (or any other language)Example:input 1: {1, 100, 2, 105, -10, 30, 100}The largest difference is between -10 and 100 -> 110 (here -10 is at the 5th index and 100 is at 7th index)input 2: {1, 100, 2, 105, -10, 30, 80}The largest difference is between 1 and 105 -> 104 (here 1 is at the 1st index and 105 is at 4th index)Possible Solution:One approach is check for all possible differences and keep a track of the biggest difference found till now O(n^2) complexity.can this be done in better than O(n^2) time?  <code> ",Find the largest possible difference in an array with the smaller integer occurring earlier
Which Appenders should be used in distributed system?," I am trying to add logging component to distributed system. It is written in AspectJ to avoid chaining current source-code. I use socket appender to send logs, but I'd like to try something more effective.I've heard I should use JMSAppender and AsyncAppender, but I failed to configure it. Should I create Receiver which gathers logs and pass them to database and to GUI (I use ChainSaw)? I tried to follow turorial1 and tutorial2 , but they aren't clear enough. Edit:In a small demo I've prepared I sent 6 logs for a request (simulation of 3 components) Using socket Appender. So my log4j.properties is: so I run with configuration Then I send my logs from file to Chainsaw:It is absolutely basic, but I want to learn how to do it better. First of all, I'd like to send logs asynchronously. Then create very simple Receiver, which e.g. can pass logs to a file. I tried to follow tutorials I listed above, but I failed. So question is: could you provide some example configuration?

Java & RabbitMQ - Queueing & Multithreading," i have one Job Distributor who publishes messages on different Channels.Further, i want to have two (and more in the future) Consumers who work on different tasks and run on different machines. (Currently i have only one and need to scale it)Let's name these tasks (just examples):FIBONACCI (generates fibonacci numbers)RANDOMBOOKS (generates random sentences to write a book)Those tasks run up to 2-3 hours and should be divided equally to each Consumer.Every Consumer can have x parallel threads for working on these tasks.So i say: (those numbers are just examples and will be replaced by variables)Machine 1 can consume 3 parallel jobs for FIBONACCI and 5 parallel jobs for RANDOMBOOKSMachine 2 can consume 7 parallel jobs for FIBONACCI and 3 parallel jobs for RANDOMBOOKSHow can i achieve this?Do i have to start x Threads for each Channel to listen on on each Consumer ?When do i have to ack that?

Weird recursion in class construction," I'm a web dev (game dev as a hobby), and I've seen myself use the following paradigm several times. (Both in developing server architecture and with video game dev work.) It seems really ugly, but I don't know a work around. I'll give an example in game dev, because it's where I recently noticed it. This is an RPG that I've been working on. Every time a battle is launched, the CombatEngine creates two parties of Combatants. Every Combatant sets up an ArtificialIntelligence object that's associated with the given Combatant, which is in charge of dictating moves for players which don't receive an explicit command: Here's what I don't like: the inner field (ArtificialIntelligence) takes a Combatant during construction, because it needs some of the Combatant fields in order to dictate appropriate actions. So, for convenience, I keep a reference to the combatant passed in as an arg to the ArtificialIntelligence object, but that object contains a reference to the ai object itself! It creates this weird recursion, but I don't know how to work around it. The AI object needs a good deal of the fields that are specific to combatant, so that's why I passed in the entire object, but I don't like how the object then contains the reference to the ai field which is contained in the overlying combatant field, which is contained in the overlying ai class. Is this bad practice, or am I simply over thinking it? <code>  public class Combatant { ArtificialIntelligence ai = null; public Combatant() { // Set other fields here. this.ai = new ArtificialIntelligence(this); }}",Weird reference passing in class construction

Safe to use getClass() inside a constructor?," In Java, is it safe to assume that getClass() called inside a constructor of a class used as a base class will provide information about the derived class, rather than the class of the base class?It seems to work, but I guess that doesn't necessarily mean it's safe.For example, if I have the following two classes: And: When I run the main() method in the Derived class it prints: Derived (which is what I was hoping).

Looking for a combination of alphabetical and natural order (aka. user sane sorting)," I thought this would be easy to find premade, but it seems any solution I can find on the web solves only part of the problem.I want to sort a list of Filenames (and the files have mostly been named after persons and/or addresses) that have been given by users, sometimes in different languages (mostly german, with a bit of french and italian mixed in here and there, and rarely any other western language).The idea is to present this list ordered in a way that the (german) users generally deem sane. That means the order should follow the java.text.Collator for Locale.GERMAN, but at the same time the expectation is to make an exception for numbers in the string, so ""10"" comes after ""2"".I have found code to do the natural sorting on the web, but it relies on comparing character by character (and Collator doesn't support that). I could hack something with substring, but inside a comparator it doesn't deem me the brightest idea to create multiple substrings on each compare-call.Any ideas how to implement this efficiently (in both execution time and implementation time), or better yet a tested and ready-to-use implementation? <code> ",Combine alphabetical and natural order (aka.

How does Java store UTF-16 characters in it's 16-bit char type?," According to the Java SE 7 Specification, Java uses the Unicode UTF-16 standard to represent characters.When imagining a String as a simple array of 16-bit variables each containing one character, life is simple.Unfortunately, there are code points for which 16 bits simply aren't enough (I believe it was 16/17th of all Unicode characters). So in a String, this poses no direct problem, because when wanting to store one of these ~1.048.576 characters using an additional two bytes, simply two array positions in that String would be used.This, without posing any direct problem, works for Strings, because there can always be an additional two bytes. Though when it comes to single variables which, in contrast to the UTF-16 encoding, have a fixed length of 16 bits, how can these characters be stored, and in particular, how does Java do it with its 2-byte ""char"" type? <code> ",How does Java store UTF-16 characters in its 16-bit char type?
Java HashSet contains duplicates," Let's say you have a class and you create a HashSet which can store this instances of this class. If you try to add instances which are equal, only one instance is kept in the collection, and that is fine. However if you have two different instances in the HashSet, and you take one and make it an exact copy of the other (by copying the fields), the HashSet will then contain two duplicate instances. Here is the code which demonstrates this: The output from the above code: Is there a way to force the HashSet to validate its contents so that possible duplicate entries created as in the above scenario get removed? A possible solution could be to create a new HashSet and copy the contents from one hashset to another so that the new hashset won't contain duplicates however I don't like this solution. <code>  public static void main(String[] args) { HashSet<GraphEdge> set = new HashSet<>(); GraphEdge edge1 = new GraphEdge(1, ""a""); GraphEdge edge2 = new GraphEdge(2, ""b""); GraphEdge edge3 = new GraphEdge(3, ""c""); set.add(edge1); set.add(edge2); set.add(edge3); edge2.setId(1); edge2.setName(""a""); for(GraphEdge edge: set) { System.out.println(edge.toString()); } if(edge2.equals(edge1)) { System.out.println(""Equals""); } else { System.out.println(""Not Equals""); } } public class GraphEdge { private int id; private String name; //Constructor ... //Getters & Setters... public int hashCode() { int hash = 7; hash = 47 * hash + this.id; hash = 47 * hash + Objects.hashCode(this.name); return hash; } public boolean equals(Object o) { if(o == this) { return true; } if(o instanceof GraphEdge) { GraphEdge anotherGraphEdge = (GraphEdge) o; if(anotherGraphEdge.getId() == this.id && anotherGraphEdge.getName().equals(this.name)) { return true; } } return false; } } 1 a1 a3 cEquals",Java HashSet contains duplicates if contained element is modified

"C++ vs Java similar codes, one crashes but why"," This was a question in one of my books (with no answer attached to it), that I've been thinking about for a few days now. Is the answer simply that the C++ code will eventually crash because it is creating a garbage memory cell after each iteration? Consider the following Java and C++ code fragments, parts of two versions of a GUI based application which collects user preferences and use them to assemble a command and its parameters. The method/function getUserCommandSpecification() returns a string representing the command code and its parameters. The returned string is used to build the required command which is then executed. Assume the following: (i) After the creation in the while loop of the Command object (referred by cmd in Java case or pointed by cmd in C++ case), the reference / pointer cmd to the generated object is no more referenced or used. (ii) The application also defines a class Command along with its method/function execute(). a. Which of the two code versions, detailed below, will eventually crash. b. Explain why a program version crashes while the other one is not crashing.Java code C++ code <code>  ...while (true) { String commandSpecification = getUserCommandSpecification(); Command cmd = new Command(commandSpecification); cmd.execute();}... ...while (true) { string commandSpecification = getUserCommandSpecification(); Command* cmd = new Command(commandSpecification); cmd -> execute();}...",C++ vs Java: endless loop creating objects only crashes C++

Struts2: How to detect submit button clicked in multiple submit buttons scenario in single Action class?," I have a form in a jsp. There are two submit buttons: ""Search"" and ""Add New"" button.

Can Gauvas TypeToken get the specific type of a generic field?," I wrote a parser for a file format called ASN.1 that uses Guices TypeLiteral.getFieldType(Field) to convert generic fields into specific Java types so I can construct the correct type (similar to Jackson or GSON databinding). But since I already depend on Guava and it seems to have a new TypeLiteral replacement, Id like to use TypeToken instead. According to the Guave TypeToken documentation: TypeToken is similar to Guice's TypeLiteral class, but with one important difference: it supports non-reified types such as T, List<T> or even List<? extends Number>; while TypeLiteral does not. TypeToken is also serializable and offers numerous additional utility methods.Can you get the reified type of a field using TypeToken? In other words, how can I do the following in Guava? <code>  import org.junit.Test;import com.google.inject.TypeLiteral;public class FieldTypeTest { public static class A<T> { T a; } public static class B { A<String> b; } @Test public void testTypeToken() throws SecurityException, NoSuchFieldException { TypeLiteral<?> reifiedA = TypeLiteral.get(B.class).getFieldType(B.class.getDeclaredField(""b"")); assertEquals(String.class, reifiedA.getFieldType(reifiedA.getRawType().getDeclaredField(""a"")).getRawType()); }}",Can Guavas TypeToken get the specific type of a generic field?
Why limit the size of PermGen?," What would be the purpose of limiting the size of the Permgen space on a Java JVM? Why not always set it equal to the max heap size?

I searched online and came up with some solutions that I am not satisfied with and I am looking for other ideas to help solve my problem.The solutions that I found:Deploy my project on Java 6 instead of Java 7 (Not recommend as I use some new features in Java 7).I found the code of the FontManager class online, but using it will require including a lot of other classes/interfaces and the process seems dummy and time consuming. Also I am not if I am allowed to use that code as it's proprietary of Sun company.What I need is: *A way to find the exact font file path on the system*.

Handle multiple EntityManager in JEE application," I have Java EE application with about 10 EntityManagers (number of EMs will probably increase). My application also contains many stateless, statefull and message driven beans.Rather than inject in each bean my EMs with @PersistenceContext (and 2 methods to detect which EM to use for user), I probably store all of that inside a singleton bean and access it with others beans. Like that, no worries about maintainability.Nevertheless, is it thread-safe to store EMs inside one singleton bean? Can a bottleneck appear?Another solution is to create an abstract class and all beans will extend it.What is the better solution? <code> ",Handle multiple EntityManager in Java EE application

Java polymorphism creating a subclass object using it's superclass variable," So I am a student and in the process of learning Java. There is one concept that I am having a difficult time grasping and am hoping that someone could shed some light on this for me. My question is regarding polymorphism. Let's say for example I have the following code. From what I understand, since the variable type is Animal, a will have all the characteristics of an Animal. But, since the object created is a Lizard, any overridden methods in the Lizard class will be used instead of those in the Animal class. Is this correct>Also, which classes constructor will be used while creating a?Thanks for any help. I have looked quite <code>  Animal a = new Lizard(""Lizzy"", 6); //Lizard extends Animal",Java polymorphism creating a subclass object using its superclass variable

Why Guava do not provide a way to transform map values," This question is kind of already posted here:How to convert Map<String, String> to Map<Long, String> using guavaI think the answer of CollinD is appropriate: All of Guava's methods for transforming and filtering produce lazy results... the function/predicate is only applied when needed as the object is used. They don't create copies. Because of that, though, a transformation can easily break the requirements of a Set. Let's say, for example, you have a Map<String, String> that contains both ""1"" and ""01"" as keys. They are both distinct Strings, and so the Map can legally contain both as keys. If you transform them using Long.valueOf(String), though, they both map to the value 1. They are no longer distinct keys. This isn't going to break anything if you create a copy of the map and add the entries, because any duplicate keys will overwrite the previous entry for that key. A lazily transformed Map, though, would have no way of enforcing unique keys and would therefore break the contract of a Map.This is true, but actually I don't understand why it is not done because:When the key transformation happen, if 2 keys are ""merged"", a runtime exception could be raised, or we could pass a flag to indicate to Guava to take any value of the multiple possible values for the newly computed key (failfast/failsafe possibilities)We could have a Maps.transformKeys which produces a MultimapIs there a drawback I don't see in doing such things? <code> ",Why Guava does not provide a way to transform map keys

Java 8: Mandatory checked exceptions handling in lambda expressions for standard Java 8 functional interfaces," I'm playing with the new lambda features in Java 8, and found that the practices offered by Java 8 are really useful. However, I'm wondering is there a good way to make a work-around for the following scenario. Suppose you have an object pool wrapper that requires some kind of a factory to fill the object pool, for example (using java.lang.functions.Factory): After transforming the functional interface into lambda expression, the code above becomes like that: Not so bad indeed, but the checked exception java.sql.SQLException requires a try/catch block inside the lambda. At my company we use two interfaces for long time:IOut<T> that is an equivalent to java.lang.functions.Factory;and a special interface for the cases that usually require checked exceptions propagation: interface IUnsafeOut<T, E extends Throwable> { T out() throws E; }.Both IOut<T> and IUnsafeOut<T> are supposed to be removed during migration to Java 8, however there is no exact match for IUnsafeOut<T, E>. If the lambda expressions could deal with checked exceptions like they were unchecked, it could be possible to use simply like the following in the constructor above: That looks much cleaner. I see that I can rewrite the ObjectPool super class to accept our IUnsafeOut<T>, but as far as I know, Java 8 is not finished yet, so could be there some changes like:implementing something similar to IUnsafeOut<T, E>? (to be honest, I consider that dirty - the subject must choose what to accept: either Factory or ""unsafe factory"" that cannot have compatible method signatures)simply ignoring checked exceptions in lambdas, so no need in IUnsafeOut<T, E> surrogates? (why not? e.g. another important change: OpenJDK, that I use, javac now does not require variables and parameters to be declared as final to be captured in an anonymous class [functional interface] or lambda expression)So the question is generally is: is there a way to bypass checked exceptions in lambdas or is it planned in the future until Java 8 is finally released?Update 1Hm-m-m, as far as I understand what we currently have, it seems there is no way at the moment, despite the referenced article is dated from 2010: Brian Goetz explains exception transparency in Java. If nothing changed much in Java 8, this could be considered an answer. Also Brian says that interface ExceptionalCallable<V, E extends Exception> (what I mentioned as IUnsafeOut<T, E extends Throwable> out of our code legacy) is pretty much useless, and I agree with him.Do I still miss something else? <code>  public class JdbcConnectionPool extends ObjectPool<Connection> { public ConnectionPool(int maxConnections, String url) { super(new Factory<Connection>() { @Override public Connection make() { try { return DriverManager.getConnection(url); } catch ( SQLException ex ) { throw new RuntimeException(ex); } } }, maxConnections); }} public class JdbcConnectionPool extends ObjectPool<Connection> { public ConnectionPool(int maxConnections, String url) { super(() -> { try { return DriverManager.getConnection(url); } catch ( SQLException ex ) { throw new RuntimeException(ex); } }, maxConnections); }} super(() -> DriverManager.getConnection(url), maxConnections);","Java 8: Mandatory checked exceptions handling in lambda expressions.

JFReeChart x axis scale," I have a JFree XY Line chart which always starts at x = 0. Then based on user defined settings from a properties file, the application increments based on that number (this represents the time in minutes).For example, x = 0 to start the user defined setting is 5 so the scale goes 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, or the user setting is 3 so it goes 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 Pretty simple.The issue I am having is the way in which the graph starts. If I start at 0, then 0 is in the middle of the graph rather than at the bottom left with -0.0000005, -0.000004, -0.000003 0.000000 , 0.000001 , 0.000002 0.000005How can I just manually add the scale at the bottom, i.e. define it should be increments of 2 and then maintain it?  <code> ",JFreeChart x axis scale

DES Send and Receive Modes," I'm trying to authenticate DESFire card with my android application. I use the example in this link to decypher the bytes I got from the card. For that, I ruled out padding in decryption (commented out below), because DESFire documentation points it out. Also, if I don't do so, decryption returns 7 bytes for input of 8 bytes. Below are DES and TripleDES decryption functions I use: According to DesFire document, I need two modes of decryption, send and receive. This blog post has some explanation about it. However, the DESFire crypto is a bit different from the normal DES/CBC scheme: The PCD uses DES send mode when sending data (xor before DES), and the card uses DES recieve mode when recieving data (xor after DES). But when the PCD recieves data, it uses normal DES/CBC mode (xor after DES), and the card uses normal DES send mode when sending data (xor before DES).And in Android side I follow the examples and recommendations: I get the first result, the encrypted randB. However, the second ""result"" is always ""91ae"", means authentication error. I'm doing something wrong here, send wrong data to card.Can anyone tell me what must I change in the code to work in these modes? What should I XOR with data before/after TripleDES?Not the real question, but I read that default ""Key"" in DesFire card is 16 zero bytes. Also the document points that I need to use TripleDES for 16 bytes of key, DES for 8 bytes of key. So I'm using and need to use TripleDES as I haven't changed the default key, am I right? For those who need the know about CipherBlockChaining.EDIT: I found out that I need to do XORing before and after TripleDES and I mustn't touch TripleDES's internal operations at all.

Client credentials flow with spring-security OAuth2," I'm trying to understand and implement a client credentials flow between our new REST server and our existing client app. I've setup spring-security OAuth2 like this. From my understanding so far, my server should now support the following request: but I get caused by the Principal being null here (spring-security code) : So it seems, I need to authenticate against the server first. But that's not what I want to do. I want two of my servers to talk to each other using a shared secret. The OAuth provider server should provide an access token to the (trusted) client server on request so that the client server can then use that token to access all REST resources on the server. This should protect the REST resources from external access. Later I want to provide selected resources to a third party and eventually implement some finer grained security for the server-to-server communication as well. But for now I need to protect the REST server from external access.Looks like I might have some misunderstandings about the whole client credentials flow or the application of spring-security right there so any clarification would be greatly appreciated. <code>  $ curl -X -v -d 'client_id=the_client&client_secret=secret&grant_type=client_credentials' -X POST ""http://localhost:9090/oauth/token"" InsufficientAuthenticationException: There is no client authentication @FrameworkEndpoint@RequestMapping(value = ""/oauth/token"")public class TokenEndpoint extends AbstractEndpoint { @RequestMapping public ResponseEntity<OAuth2AccessToken> getAccessToken(Principal principal, @RequestParam(""grant_type"") String grantType, @RequestParam Map<String, String> parameters) { if (!(principal instanceof Authentication)) { throw new InsufficientAuthenticationException(",Understanding OAuth2 Client credentials flow
String Constant Pool Java," As explained in these Stackoverflow questions: question 1 & question 2 I understand that ""String literals"" are interned when: And that the JVM will create a new String object instead of using an existing one from the String Pool when: However, I have a doubt after reading the following two similar statements. From SCJP preparation book: When the compiler encounters a String literal, it checks the pool to see if an identical String already exists. If a match is found, the reference to the new literal is directed to the existing String, and no new String literal object is created. From JavaRanch: In this case, we actually end up with a slightly different behavior because of the keyword ""new."" In such a case, references to String literals are still put into the constant table (the String Literal Pool), but, when you come to the keyword ""new,"" the JVM is obliged to create a new String object at run-time, rather than using the one from the constant table.So if we also put a reference in nonpool memory AND in pool memory when we create an object using ""new"" and based on the definitions above. Shouldn't the JVM also return the same reference when we do this?: Because when declaring the String literal String three = ""test""; it will already exist in the pool? and therefore should return the same reference and print true? or do the previous statements mean that they will be put in pool memory but simply skipped when the new operator is used? <code>  String s = ""abc""; String s = new String(""abc""); String one = new String(""test"");String two = ""test"";System.out.println(one.equals(two)); // trueSystem.out.println(one == two); // false",String Constant Pool
When exactly is the httpsession expired?," I would like to know when exactly an HttpSession would be expired (not the same as destroyed)? I am trying to figure out if session.getLastAccessedTime() + (session.getMaxInactiveInterval() * 1000) will give me the exact time in milliseconds of session expiry each time a request comes with the same session id!From the javadocs: long getLastAccessedTime() int getMaxInactiveInterval() Lets say we have the following:Treq1 - the time the container received the 1st request (HttpSession.lastAccessedTime)Tresp1 - the time the container sends the 1st responsePreq1 - the time period between Treq1 and Tresp1 (the time period that the server processes the 1st requestTreq2 - the time the container received the 2nd request (HttpSession.lastAccessedTime)Preq1req2 - the time period between Treq1 and Treq2 (the time between requests entering the container)Presp1req2 - the time period between Tresp1 and Treq2 (the time between the 1st response exiting the container and the 2nd request entering the container) So now, when does the server calculate the session as expired? When:1. Treq1 + maxInactiveInterval < Treq1 + Preq1req2 => maxInactiveInterval < Preq1req22. Tresp1 + maxInactiveInterval < Tresp1 + Presp1req2 => maxInactiveInterval < Presp1req2 This part, the servlet container will keep this session open between client accesses is a bit confusing. Does it mean between requests entering the container or between response exiting and requests entering? On a side note, I know that the session might not be destroyed at the exact time of expiry, but I don't know yet if it is destroyed before any request processing logic occurs in the container. I am referring to the request that holds an expired session id.Kind Regards,Despot <code>  Returns the last time the client sent a request associated with this session, as the number of milliseconds since midnight January 1, 1970 GMT, and marked by the time the container received the request.

What would the side effects be of me changing the above and making ClientConfig, Client and WebResource as class level instance variables? i.e. change to this: Is the above likely to fail if multiple users call different methods at the same time? What is the best way to structure the above?If the Jersey client methods had close() methods, i could have left them the way they were and just close the resources inside the methods.  <code>  public void getUser() { ClientConfig config = new DefaultClientConfig(); Client client = Client.create(config); WebResource service = client.resource(RESOURCE_URL); // Get response as String String response = service.path(""/addUser"").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN) .get(String.class); return response; } ClientConfig config = new DefaultClientConfig();Client client = Client.create(config);WebResource service = client.resource(RESOURCE_URL);public void getUser() { // Get response as String String response = service.path(""/addUser"").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN) .get(String.class); return response; } public void getUserAccount() { // Get response as String String response = service.path(""/getUserAccount"").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN) .get(String.class); return response; }",Jersey client services - closing resources

But when I saw the constructor of PrintStream class, it takes a parameter of type OutputStream and as far as I know we cannot create the object of an abstract class. In that case we must pass some subclass's object to the constructor of PrintStream. What is that class? Same is the System.in.

Spring RedirectAttributes: addAttribute vs addFlashAttribute," My understanding so far is on our controller request mapping method we can specify RedirectAttributes parameter and populate it with attributes for when the request gets redirected.Example: The redirect attributes will then be available on the target page where it redirects to.However RedirectAttributes class has two methods:addAttribute()addFlashAttribute()Have been reading Spring documentation for a while but I'm a bit lost.

java synchronization confusion," Possible Duplicate: Java Synchronized Block for .class I was reading through an article on synchronization. I am confused on below points and need more clarification1) For synchronization block. How differs from 2) Synchronizing instance method means threads will have to get exclusive lock on the instance, while synchronizing static method means thread will have to acquire a lock on whole class(correct me if I am wrong). So if a class has three methods and one of them is static synchronized then if a thread acquires lock on that method then that means it will acquire lock on the whole class. So does that mean the other two will also get locked and no other method will be able to access those two methods as the whole class is having lock? <code>  synchronize(this){ // code } synchronize(MyClass.class){ //code }",synchronize(this) vs synchronize(MyClass.class)

new BigInteger(String) complexity," I'm wondering about the performance/complexity of constructing BigInteger objects with the new BigInteger(String) constructor.Consider the following method: This method creates BigInteger objects of Strings with 10^x digits, where x=1 at the beginning, and it's increased with every iteration. It measures and outputs the time required for constructing the corresponding BigInteger object.On my machine (Intel Core i5 660, JDK 6 Update 25 32 bit) the output is: While ignoring the lines up to 10^5 (because of possible distortions introduced by (processor) caching effects, JIT-compilation etc), we can clearly see a complexity of O(n^2) here.Keeping in mind that every operation on a BigInteger creates a new one due to immutability, this is a major performance penality for huge numbers.Questions:Did I miss something?Why is this the case?Is this fixed in more recent JDKs?Are there any alternatives?UPDATE:I did further measurements and I can confirm the statement from some of the answers: It seems that BigInteger is optimized for subsequent numerical operations with the expense of higher construction costs for huge numbers which seems reasonable for me. <code>  public static void testBigIntegerConstruction() { for (int exp = 1; exp < 10; exp++) { StringBuffer bigNumber = new StringBuffer((int) Math.pow(10.0, exp)); for (int i = 0; i < Math.pow(10.0, exp - 1); i++) { bigNumber.append(""1234567890""); } String val = bigNumber.toString(); long time = System.currentTimeMillis(); BigInteger bigOne = new BigInteger(val); System.out.println(""time for constructing a 10^"" + exp + "" digits BigInteger : "" + ((System.currentTimeMillis() - time)) + "" ms""); } } time for constructing a 10^1 digits BigInteger : 0 mstime for constructing a 10^2 digits BigInteger : 0 mstime for constructing a 10^3 digits BigInteger : 0 mstime for constructing a 10^4 digits BigInteger : 16 mstime for constructing a 10^5 digits BigInteger : 656 mstime for constructing a 10^6 digits BigInteger : 59936 mstime for constructing a 10^7 digits BigInteger : 6227975 ms",new BigInteger(String) performance / complexity

Retrieving a List from a java.util.stream.Stream in Java8," I was playing around with Java 8 lambdas to easily filter collections. But I did not find a concise way to retrieve the result as a new list within the same statement. Here is my most concise approach so far: Examples on the net did not answer my question because they stop without generating a new result list. There must be a more concise way. I would have expected, that the Stream class has methods as toList(), toSet(), Is there a way that the variables targetLongList can be directly be assigned by the third line? <code>  List<Long> sourceLongList = Arrays.asList(1L, 10L, 50L, 80L, 100L, 120L, 133L, 333L);List<Long> targetLongList = new ArrayList<>();sourceLongList.stream().filter(l -> l > 100).forEach(targetLongList::add);",Retrieving a List from a java.util.stream.Stream in Java 8
Python very slow as compared to with Java for this algoritm," I'm studying algorithms and decided to port the Java Programs from the textbook to Python, since I dislike the Java overhead, especially for small programs, and as an exercise.The algorithm itself is very simple, It just takes all triplets out of an array, in a bruteforce kinda way, and counts how many of the triplets sum up to zero (eg: [-2,7,-5]) I ported it to : Now measuring just these functions are taking : Of course this is not a good algorithm, it just goes to show, both here and in the textbook.

Find duplicate element in array in time O(N)," I have been asked this question in a job interview and I have been wondering about the right answer. You have an array of numbers from 0 to n-1, one of the numbers is removed, and replaced with a number already in the array which makes a duplicate of that number. How can we detect this duplicate in time O(n)?For example, an array of 4,1,2,3 would become 4,1,2,2.The easy solution of time O(n2) is to use a nested loop to look for the duplicate of each element. <code> ",Find duplicate element in array in time O(n)

Inheritance: object creation. JAVA," Let's say I have this piece of code: I am aware of the super() implicitly placed in the first line of the no-args constructor, so I know that the Animal constructor will be executed and so the Animal's instance variable will be set. To this purpose I would like to understand if, once those variables have been initialized by the super constructor (Animal), those instance variable will be kept there in the Animal object or copied to the subclass (Dog). In the first case an object Animal will be instantiated implicitly by super(); and whenever the instance Dog will need to access one of those variable it will be done accessing to the variables kept in the instance Animal (created on background). Or second case, if the object Animal will be temporary created, all the instance variable (in Animal) copied to the Dog instance and then deleting the Animal's instance temporary created.I personally think that for example a Dog object would be directly linked to an Animal object which is directly connected to an object.Is it in this way? <code>  class Animal { int legs = 4; int head = 1;}public class Dog extends Animal { public static void main (String []args) { Dog dog = new Dog(); }}",Inheritance: object creation

Q: Why my compiled class has it's methods local variables renamed?," I have a Kitchen.jar file. I need to modify a class inside it. I decompile it with JD. Then I modify the Toster.java file and compile it with: And then I take it back into the Kitchen.jar with: All works except for one problem. When I open updated Kitchen.jar in JD I see that local variables inside all methods are renamed to something like localLongVar. Why?The reason I ask is because Kitchen.jar refuses to work after the modification. And I suspect it has to be the compilation problem. Maybe I've misused some flags or anything. Not sure. I have no knowledge of Java whatsoever, except for the basic syntax.My guess is that I compile it with latest 1.7 version and original jar is compiled with older JDK. That may explain failure of operation, but that doesn't explain the renaming of locals.EXAMPLEThe random line from the original jar: And the very same line of my class: So its result vs arrayOfBigInteger1. <code>  javac -classpath . Toster.java jar -uf Kitchen.jar Toster.class BigInteger[] result = new BigInteger[bis.length / 2]; BigInteger[] arrayOfBigInteger1 = new BigInteger[paramArrayOfBigInteger.length * 2];",Why my compiled class has it's methods local variables renamed?

What I want to know is how HelloWorld goes through each layer, and then come back from it. Assume this program runs on an Intel CPU with Ubuntu. I will keep this post updated by combining good answers until one answer is finally accepted. The following is THE HelloWorld program that everybody knows. It is compiled to bytecode like the following. The bytecode is not readable, but we can use javap -classpath . -c HelloWorld to see mnemonics like the following. Then it gets loaded, linked and initialized in JVM. Since it has only one thread, let's assume it is the the left thread in the following JVM run-time data area. JVM threads are user-level threads, so it will be mapped to kernel. In Ubuntu, it is one-to-one mapping like the following:Now JVM makes the x86 instructions?

Injecting into @Autowired variable during testing," I have a component setup that is essentially a launcher for an application. It is configured like so: MyService is annotated with the @Service Spring annotation and is autowired into my launcher class without any issues. I would like to write some jUnit test cases for MyLauncher, to do so I started a class like this: Can I create a Mock object for MyService and inject it into myLauncher in my test class? I currently don't have a getter or setter in myLauncher as Spring is handling the autowiring. If possible, I'd like to not have to add getters and setters. Can I tell the test case to inject a mock object into the autowired variable using an @Before init method?If I'm going about this completely wrong, feel free to say that. I'm still new to this. My main goal is to just have some Java code or annotation that puts a mock object in that @Autowired variable without me having to write a setter method or having to use an applicationContext-test.xml file. I would much rather maintain everything for the test cases in the .java file instead of having to maintain a separate application content just for my tests.I am hoping to use Mockito for the mock objects. In the past I have done this by using org.mockito.Mockito and creating my objects with Mockito.mock(MyClass.class). <code>  @Componentpublic class MyLauncher { @Autowired MyService myService; //other methods} public class MyLauncherTest private MyLauncher myLauncher = new MyLauncher(); @Test public void someTest() { }}",Injecting @Autowired private field during testing

play framework 2.1 java: bind complex form data automatically," My JSON data coming in request().body().asFormUrlEncoded().get(""records"") My form definition: It doesn't bind the records automatically.

I can catch a 401 error in my ajax call.But when the authentication is performed automatically, like the code bellow: the HTTP response is: There is no ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"" in the responseGoogle Chrome console show the following error: My ajax call does not return a 401 Unauthorized error, even though the HTTP response return it (response above), I receive an unknow error.I figured out that for all browsers, I need a ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"" in the HTTP response, otherwise they will generate some kind of silent error and my ajax call will fail (can't catch the 401 error). Actually, javascript will fail silently.

Use of spring-core and spring-context dependecies together in a Spring project. Is it necessary?," I am a beginner in Spring and I am trying to learn it by reading some codes scattered around on the internet. When I look at the pom.xml of these codes, I almost always see that people use ""spring-core"" and ""spring-context"" next to each other as added dependencies for that project. When I look at the dependency hierarchy, I see that spring-core is already in the spring-context.So my question: is it necessary to use both? Is there a difference between ""spring-core"" in the ""spring-context"" and ""spring-core"" as a separate artifact? <code> ",Necessary to use spring-core and spring-context dependencies together in a Spring project?
Pre-initializing a pool of worker threads in Java," I need to build a pool of workers in Java where each worker has its own connected socket; when the worker thread runs, it uses the socket but keeps it open to reuse later. We decided on this approach because the overhead associated with creating, connecting, and destroying sockets on an ad-hoc basis required too much overhead, so we need a method by which a pool of workers are pre-initializaed with their socket connection, ready to take on work while keeping the socket resources safe from other threads (sockets are not thread safe), so we need something along these lines... }On application startup, we want to initialize the workers and, hopefully, the socket connections somehow too... As work is requested by the application, we send tasks to the worker pool for immediate execution... Updated with Working CodeBased on helpful comments from Gray and jontejj, I've got the following code working...SocketTask ExecutorService I like this approach for several reasons...Sockets are local objects (via ThreadLocal) available to the running tasks, eliminating concurrency issues. Sockets are created once and kept open, reusedwhen new tasks get queued, eliminating socket object create/destroy overhead. <code>  public class SocketTask implements Runnable { Socket socket; public SocketTask(){ //create + connect socket here } public void run(){ //use socket here } MyWorkerPool pool = new MyWorkerPool();for( int i = 0; i < 100; i++) pool.addWorker( new WorkerThread()); pool.queueWork( new SocketTask(..)); public class SocketTask implements Runnable { private String workDetails; private static final ThreadLocal<Socket> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<Socket>(){ @Override protected Socket initialValue(){ return new Socket(); } }; public SocketTask(String details){ this.workDetails = details; } public void run(){ Socket s = getSocket(); //gets from threadlocal //send data on socket based on workDetails, etc. } public static Socket getSocket(){ return threadLocal.get(); }} ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5, Executors.defaultThreadFactory()); int tasks = 15; for( int i = 1; i <= tasks; i++){ threadPool.execute(new SocketTask(""foobar-"" + i)); } ",Pre-initializing a pool of worker threads to reuse connection objects (sockets)
Select Element with Max Occurence in Multiset," I may want to rephrase the question to ""How do I select first item in a Multiset?"" because it seems Multiset is already ordered according to frequencies. I have a Multiset myList = Multiset.create(); I could not find any method like myList.getIndex(0). Please note, in the end, I need the count of element that has maximum frequency.Is there any one liner for this ? Or do I have to do that iteration?Update : I am getting maximum frequency using : But this is too slow. Can you please suggest, what exactly should I use?Update 1: Using above copyHighestCountFirst method is proving too slow. In one instance of loop, it is taking 80+milliseconds opposed to average 40 milliseconds using without it. In large loops, should I prefer simple iteration?Update 2 : Got it working using : Without almost zero impact on performance. I still wonder if there is any better way to do it. Sidenote : In Python I did the same with :  <code>  [maa00 mfnt11 malignlft mbold mlt18 mfl x 3, caa00 cfnt11 calignlft cbold clt17 cfl] myList.count(Multisets.copyHighestCountFirst(myList).asList().get(0))); myList.count(myList.entrySet().iterator().next().getElement()) j = defaultdict(int)for k in clList: j[k] +=1result1 = max(j.iteritems(), key=lambda x:x[1]) //count of frequency of item with max count",Select Element with Max Occurrence in Multiset

Does LinkedList really faster than ArrayList in the case of insertion in the middle of list?," - What is the difference between LinkedList and ArrayList? When is it preferable to use a LinkedList?I think every Java developer has heard this question at interview at least once.- Linked list is preferable if you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list.It is a common answer to this question. Everybody knows it. Every time you ask a question about the difference between List implementations you get such answers as: When should I use LinkedList? When do you need efficient removal in between elements or at the start?From here Forgot to mention insertion costs. In a LinkedList, once you have the correct position, insertion costs O(1), while in an ArrayList it goes up to O(n) - all elements past the insertion point must be moved.From here Linked lists are preferable over arrays when you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list (such as a priority queue).From here ArrayList is slower because it needs to copy part of the array in order to remove the slot that has become free. LinkedList just has to manipulate a couple of references.From hereAnd more...But have you ever tried to reproduce it by yourself? I tried yesterday and got these results: Output: LL time: 114098106 AL time: 24121889So what is it? Why does LinkedList suck so much? Maybe we should try the remove operation instead of add? Ok, let's try: Output: LL time: 27581163 AL time: 3103051Oh, ArrayList is still faster than LinkedList. What is the reason? Was this myth busted?

How to properly handle InnoDB deadlocks in Java?," I am working on a theory basis here, I want to make sure all my bases are covered.I have read quite a bit into InnoDB with Java and how deadlocks can occur no matter what query you are running. Although I am pretty clued in with the theory and best practices, I am pretty much clueless on how to implement the catch all mechanism of reissuing transactions when a deadlock occurs.Are there specific exceptions to listen out for? Is the exception only thrown after I call connection.commit() or can it occur as soon as I execute a PreparedStatement? Should things be running in a loop with a limit to how many times the loop runs?I essentially just need a bare bones Java code example of how this thing is generally handled. As I am not sure where things factor in such as, do I re-instantiate PreparedStatement objects or close them first etc etc, it's all very confusing. Same goes for ResultSet objects too.Edit: I should probably mention that I am working with transactions, setting auto commit to 0 etc.Edit 2: Am I on the right track with this pseudo code? I have no clue <code>  do{ deadlock = false try { // auto commit = 0 // select query // update query // delete query // commit transaction } catch (DeadLockSpecificException e) { deadlock = true } finally { // close resources? statement.close(), resultset.close() etc? // or do I reuse them somehow and close them after the do/while loop? // this stuff confuses me a lot too }}while (deadlock == true);",How to properly handle InnoDB deadlocks in Java/JDBC?

Java: Flip image stored as a byte[] array," I have an image which is stored as a byte[] array, and I want to flip the image before I send it off to be processed elsewhere (as a byte[] array).I've searched around and can't find a simple solution without manipulating each bit in the byte[] array.What about converting the byte array[] to an image type of some sort, flipping that using an existing flip method, and then converting that back to a byte[] array?Any advice?Cheers! <code> ",Flip image stored as a byte[] array
How to sign (dynamic) JNLP files for OSX 10.8.4 and Gatekeeper," My company produces Java Applications for Servers and delivers JNLP files to start local Applications. Since OSX 10.8.4 it is required to sign JNLP files with a Developer ID to keep Gatekeeper happy (it's actually in the release notes at the very bottom).The question is: how to accomplish this? AFAIK you can sign Apps (we have some Java Apps signed with Developer IDs) - but JNLP - Files are just that: files.Next: how to do this with generated JNLP files. We have to modify them as they come from a server - e.g. properties, base URL and so forth.AFAIK Java has a certain mechanism to say JNLP files are signed via their respective JAR file (the one that holds the main class) - but: Jar files are signed with a different certificate they will not satisfy Gatekeeper as well.I did find one reference on how to sign tools and stuff, but it does not apply the scenario of dynamic files.What I do not want as answers: Right-Click and Open to override the Gatekeeper or change the System- or Java settings. This is not an option. [UPDATE]Since OSX 10.9.5 you also have to sign using OSX 10.9+ and have valid version 2 signatures. How will this be done? <code> ",How to sign (dynamic) JNLP files for OSX and Gatekeeper
Class or Class<? extends SomeClass>," I am writing a program which will use Java reflection (i.e., Class.forName()) to dynamically create class instance based on user's input. One requirement is that the instance my program creates must extend one specific Class I defined, called it SomeClass. My question is: for storing this class type, should I use bounded generic, Class<? extends SomeClass>, or simply unbounded generic, Class? I found some Java books say that Class is one of the good practices for using unbounded wildcard generic, but I am wondering whether this apply to the situation in my program.Please feel free to let me know if you found my question is not clear enough or some information is needed. <code> ",Java Generics - Class or Class<? extends SomeClass>

How to create a .docx file in android," Let me just start out by saying I created an account on here because I've been beating my head against a wall in order to try and figure this out, so here it goes.Also, I have already seen this question here. Neither one of those answers have helped and I have tried both of them. I need to create a word document with a simple table and data inside. I decided to create a sample document in which to get the xml that I need to create the document. I moved all the folders from the unzipped docx file into my assets folder. Once I realized I couldn't write to the assets folder, I wrote a method to copy all the files and folders over to an external storage location of the device and then write the document I created to the same location. From there Im trying to zip the files back up to a .docx file. This is where things arent working. The actual docx file is created and I can move it to my computer through the DDMS but when I go to view it Word says its corrupt. Heres whats weird though, if I unzip it and then rezip it on my computer without making any changes what so ever it works perfectly. I have used a program (for mac) called DiffMerge to compare the sample unzipped docx file to the unzipped docx that I have created and it says they are exactly the same. So, I think it has something to do with the zipping process in Android.I have also tried unzipping the sample docx file on my computer, moving all the files and folders over to my assets folder including the document.xml file and just try to zip it up without adding my own document.xml file and using the sample one and that doesnt work either. Another thing I tried was to place the actual docx file in my assets folder, unzipping it onto my external storage and then rezipping it without doing anything. This also fails. I'm basically at a loss. Please somebody help me figure this out. Here is some of my code:moveDocxFoldersFromAssetsToExternalStorage() is called first.After that is called all the files have been moved over.Then, I create the document.xml file and place it in the word directory where it belongsEverything is where it should be and I now try to create the zip file.. EDITHere is the code I wrote in order to get it working correctly based on what @edi9999 said below. I created a separate class that Im going to expand and add to and probably clean up a bit but this is working code. It adds all the files in a directory to the zip file and recursively calls itself to add all the subfiles and folders.  <code>  private boolean moveDocxFoldersFromAssetsToExternalStorage(){ File rootDir = new File(this.externalPath); rootDir.mkdir(); copy(""""); // This is to get around a glitch in Android which doesnt list files or folders // with an underscore at the beginning of the name in the assets folder. // This renames them once they are saved to the device. // We need it to show up in the list in order to move them.

Active Directory authentication through Load Balancer," I'm able to authenticate to Active Directory if there is need to configure only one AD server. The solution is given as Active Directory authentication through ssl as anonymous user by me. Now I'm stuck when there is multiple ADs running behind a Load Balancer.Since Load Balancer is in between, I will get the Host name only and the IP of AD will be replaced with the Host name behind the Load Balancer based on the availability. Therefore, I won't be able to know which Active Directory server will be used to process my request of authentication. So , I won't be able to generate the certificate in advance.

About memory usage in java," Hi i am attempting to discover why my program's usually run slower than i want them so thank you in advance for your help!I have for example a piece of code that i would like some insight into in Line #2. I create a new Object. This will happen thousands of times in my program. Do i specifically have to null the old Object out before gc will destroy it? Or will gc go behind my program picking up all the memory those other Objects used.Or another option altogether is this happening: A certain amount of memory is being allocated and every time i create a new Object it is then assigned to that exact same memory.Bruno asked me to show a more realistic piece of code so we could figure out why it was running slowly. But, because of your answer Bruno i realized that i had my code like this So i realized i had Strong references to my Objects. Thank you Bruno! <code>  1. while(conditionIsTrue){2.

Is it possible to create an URL pointing to a memory mapped object?," I'm trying to extend my library for integrating Swing and JPA by making JPA config as automatic (and portable) as can be done, and it means programmatically adding <class> elements. (I know it can be done via Hibernate's AnnotationConfiguration or EclipseLInk's ServerSession, but - portability). I'd also like to avoid using Spring just for this single purpose.I can create a persistence.xml on the fly, and fill it with <class> elements from specified packages (via the Reflections library). The problem starts when I try to feed this persistence.xml to a JPA provider. The only way I can think of is setting up a URLClassLoader, but I can't think of a way what wouldn't make me write the file to the disk somewhere first, for sole ability to obtain a valid URL. Setting up a socket for serving the file via an URL(localhost:xxxx) seems... I don't know, evil?Does anyone have an idea how I could solve this problem? I know it sounds like a lot of work to avoid using one library, but I'd just like to know if it can be done.EDIT (a try at being more clear):Dynamically generated XML is kept in a String object. I don't know how to make it available to a persistence provider. Also, I want to avoid writing the file to disk.For purpose of my problem, a persistence provider is just a class which scans the classpath for META-INF/persistence.xml. Some implementations can be made to accept dynamic creation of XML, but there is no common interface (especially for a crucial part of the file, the <class> tags).My idea is to set up a custom ClassLoader - if you have any other I'd be grateful, I'm not set on this one.The only easily extendable/configurable one I could find was a URLClassLoader. It works on URL objects, and I don't know if I can create one without actually writing XML to disk first.That's how I'm setting things up, but it's working by writing the persistenceXmlFile = new File(""META-INF/persistence.xml"") to disk: URLResourceClassLoader is URLCLassLoader's subclass, which allows for looking up resources as well as classes, by overriding public Enumeration<URL> findResources(String name). <code>  Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader( new URLResourceClassLoader( new URL[] { persistenceXmlFile.toURI().toURL() }, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() ));",Is it possible to create an URL pointing to an in-memory object?

Multiple callback waiting in Android/Java?," In Java threads, you could have some number of threads in a list, start them off, and have a main thread join one, then another, going through and waiting for all processes to complete before moving on.In other models, I'm not sure how you would do that. Take the RootTools 3.0 Command class for example. You create a Command which has three methods, commandOutput, commandFinished, commandTerminated, and while you can use a callback to do something at the end of a process, I don't know how you would wait for multiple processes (For example, going through listing of several directories and summing the file-sizes).I believe the Android Asynctask would have a similar problem - you can easily make a callback, but there is no way to wait for several tasks.

Is String.hashCode() inefficient?," When looking at the source code of java.lang.String of openjdk-1.6, i saw that String.hashCode() uses 31 as prime number and computes Now the reason for me to look at this was the question i had in mind whether comparing hashCodes in String.equals would make String.equals significantly faster. But looking at hashCode now, the following questions come to my mind:Wouldn't a bigger prime help avoid collisions better, at least for short strings, seeing that for example ""BC"" has the same hash as ""Ab"" (since the ascii letters live in the region 65-122, wouldn't a prime higher than that work better)?Is it a conscious decision to use 31 as prime, or just some random one that is used because it is common?How likely is a hash collision, given a fixed String length? where this question is heading is the original question how good comparing hashCodes and String length could already discern strings, to avoid comparing the actual contents.a little off-topic, maybe: Is there a good reason String.equals does not compare hashCodes as additional shortcut?a little more off-topic: assuming we have two Strings with the same content, but different instances: is there any way to assert equality without actually comparing the contents? I would guess not, since someway into String lengths, the space explodes into sizes where we will inevitably have collisions, but what about some restrictions - only a certain character set, a maximum string length... and how much do we need to restrict the string space to be able to have such a hash function? <code>  s[0]*31^(n-1) + s[1]*31^(n-2) + ... + s[n-1]",Is String.hashCode() inefficient?

Why Thread.sleep is bad to use - Java," Apologies for this repeated question but I haven't found any satisfactory answers yet. Most of the question had their own specific use case:Java - alternative to thread.sleepIs there any better or alternative way to skip/avoid using Thread.sleep(1000) in Java?My question is for the very generic use case. Wait for a condition to complete. Do some operation. Check for a condition. If the condition is not true, wait for some time and again do the same operation.For e.g. Consider a method that creates a DynamoDB table by calling its createAPI table. DynamoDB table takes some time to become active so that method would call its DescribeTable API to poll for status at regular intervals until some time(let's say 5 mins - deviation due to thread scheduling is acceptable). Returns true if the table becomes active in 5 mins else throws exception.Here is pseudo code: I understand that by using Thread.sleep blocks the current thread, thereby consuming resources. but in a fairly mid size application, is one thread a big concern?I read somewhere that use ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor and do this status polling there. But again, we would have to initialize this pool with at least 1 thread where runnable method to do the polling would run.Any suggestions on why using Thread.sleep is said to be such a bad idea and what are the alternative options for achieving same as above.http://msmvps.com/blogs/peterritchie/archive/2007/04/26/thread-sleep-is-a-sign-of-a-poorly-designed-program.aspx <code>  public void createDynamoDBTable(String name) { //call create table API to initiate table creation //wait for table to become active long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis() + MAX_WAIT_TIME_FOR_TABLE_CREATE; while(System.currentTimeMillis() < endTime) { boolean status = //call DescribeTable API to get status; if(status) { //status is now true, return return } else { try { Thread.sleep(10*1000); } catch(InterruptedException e) { } } } throw new RuntimeException(""Table still not created"");}",Why Thread.sleep is bad to use

javax.mail.Session lifespan and performance," Below the code used to connect and perform operations on an IMAP Folder.So my question is about the javax.mail.Session which in this case would recreate every second (depending on the sleep time and runtime of checkInbox()).I'm sure that this is not a good solution, especially polling on IMAP is kinda stupid but I couldn't get the IMAP listener running.Recreating the Session not every run might be a better solution but how do I know when a session is closed or can I close it on purpose? But there is nothing like Session.close() or is the Session than NULL? Or is there some defined timeout on a Session...Source: All in all I have to say it's really hard to find good examples and documentation for javax.mail (besides the API and the FAQ) <code>  final String port = ""993"";Properties prop = new Properties();// I assume there is some redundancy here but this didn't cause any problems so farprop.setProperty(""mail.imaps.starttls.enable"", ""true"");prop.setProperty(""mail.imaps.port"", port);/** This part can be removed * prop.setProperty(""mail.imaps.socketFactory.class"", ""javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory""); * prop.setProperty(""mail.imaps.socketFactory.port"", port); * prop.setProperty(""mail.imaps.socketFactory.fallback"", ""false""); */prop.setProperty(""mail.imap.ssl.enable"", ""true"");prop.setProperty(""mail.debug"", ""false"");// Create a session before you loop since the configuration doesn't changeSession session = Session.getInstance(prop);// Nearly loop forever in Prodwhile(true){ // Check the INBOX and do some other stuff Store store = session.getStore(""imaps""); store.connect(host, user, pw); // ... the operations on the session ... store.close();// Sleep a bit try & catch removedThread.sleep(1000);}",Java Mail: Session
Number of Object Creation in Inheritance in java?," Let's say I have three classes: When I create an instance of class C, it calls the constructor of super class. So, is there more than one object that is getting created? If only one object is created, then how is super() like another class' constructor? Does super() method internally create an object? What I know is, the constructor is also a method (I may be wrong).My questions are:How many number of Object is created in this case?If one object is created then how does Super() internally call the parent class constructor? <code>  class A { A() { // super(); System.out.println(""class A""); }}class B extends A { B() { // super(); System.out.println(""class B""); }}class C extends B { public static void main(String args[]) { C c = new C(); //Parent constructor will get called }}",How many objects are created due to inheritance in java?

how to process servlet requests during long shutdown," We need to implement a graceful shutdown mechanism into our Servlet application.EDIT: We want to make it simple as possible, which would be handling a kill signal sent via operating system's function. This would allow system admins to use built in shell utilities (kill or taskkill on Windows), otherwise they would have to install another utility just to ""talk"" with server.This mechanism works in two phases:upon shutdown request, deny certain critical activitiesblock until previously initiated critical actions are completed; these may take several hoursPhase #1 is implemented in our DAO layer.Phase #2 is implemented in our ServletContextListener#contextDestroyed methodOur problem is that once contextDestroyed is called the Servlet container stops servicing further HTTP requests.EDIT: contextDestroyed is called when someone is calling the operating system's kill function on server's process.We would like to let the application alive during Phase #2, notifying the users that some activities are unavailable.  <code> ",How to process servlet requests during long shutdown
What is the maven way for project versions when doing continuous delivery?," I have a web application where we deploy to production whenever a feature is ready, sometimes that can be a couple of times a day, sometimes it can be a couple of weeks between releases. Currently, we don't increment our version numbers for our project, and everything has been sitting at version 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT for well over a year.I am wondering what is the Maven way for doing continuous delivery for a web apps. It seems overkill to bump up the version number on every commit, and never bumping the version number like we are doing now, also seems wrong.What is the recommend best practice for this type of Maven usage?The problem is actually a two-fold one:Advancing project version number in individual pom.xml file (and there can be many).Updating version number in all dependent components to use latest ones of each other. <code> ",What is the Maven way for automatic project versions when doing continuous delivery?

Get File object for Java resource so I can use FileUtils.readLines," I have to read a file containing a list of strings. I'm trying to follow the advice in this post. Both solutions require using FileUtils.readLines, but use a String, not a File as the parameter. I need a File.This post would be my question, except the OP was dissuaded from using files entirely. I need a file if I want to use the Apache method, which is the my preferred solution to my initial problem.My file is small (a hundred lines or so) and a singleton per program instance, so I do not need to worry about having another copy of the file in memory. Therefore I could use more basic methods to read the file, but so far it looks like FileUtils.readLines could be much cleaner. How do I go from resource to file. <code>  Set<String> lines = new HashSet<String>(FileUtils.readLines(""foo.txt""));",How do I get a Java resource as a File?

where exactly does the compilation of source code to byte code happens in Java?," I did some search trying to understand how the java source files are executed.

Corrections on my understanding are most welcome. Two questions marked Q1 and Q2 are below point 2.write a HellowWorld.java filejavac HelloWowrld.java gives HelloWorld.class. That is it gives a class file which is byte code. Now I can take this bytecode generated in Mac and go to windows machine and run it which should work fine. Q1: Now this compilation to byte code, is this really a compilation or is it interpreted?Q2: Javac must be a part of JDK and NOT JRE?JRE contains JVM and other libraries to create runtime environment. JVM(which by itself is platform dependent) executes the bytecode to machine code. Just-in-time compiler which is actually the part of JVM does the real compilation part of bytecode to machine code, plus caching byte codes if necessary.garbage collection is encompassed in JRE. <code> ",Where exactly does the compilation of source code to byte code happen in Java?

Java - Using annotations for exception handling?," Let's say I have a method that throws an Exception of some kind. The exception-throwing code lies in a third-party library that access an external service. I have a few classes that do a good deal of work with external services and there is a LOT of exception handling throughout to deal with potential problems. The issue I'm hitting is that I may have a lot of exceptions, but I may only need to perform one of a few actions if there is one, and there are a ton of try/catch blocks peppered about. The type of exception may not even be relevant, or different methods may throw the same type of exception, but different actions need to be taken depending on the method throwing it.What I'm looking for is an annotation that can supplant try/catch and simply dictate the behavior to be taken when there is an exception in that method. I know that Spring ApsectJ can do this sort of thing, but I'm not currently able to easily add any new dependencies or modify the pom to adjust existing ones. As such, I'm hoping that this can be accomplished with a custom annotation. For example: I would presume that a separate class would handle exceptions, of course. An additional difficulty is that I would need the ServiceObj that is passed as well. If makeThingsHappen() fails, I may need obj to perform additional actions. The action variable will tell the handler class what to do with obj.Can this be done without severe muckery, or am I hoping for something that may not exist? <code>  @Catcher(action=SomeEnum.SOME_ACTION)public void doSomething(ServiceObj obj) throws SomeException { ExternalService.makeThingsHappen(obj);}",Using annotations for exception handling?

How does Arrays implement the interface Cloneable in Java?," From the documentation of Object#clone(): Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface Cloneable. Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method performs a ""shallow copy"" of this object, not a ""deep copy"" operation.But the documentation of java.util.Arrays doesn't indicate that Arrays implements Cloneable.

Multiple Jackson Serializers of Same Return Type on Mixin," I am using Jackson for JSON serialization and have written a couple custom String serializers, one for each getter method of a class. The methods each return the same type, Set<String>, but each uses a different serializer.Unfortunately, Jackson is not using each serializer, one for each method, but is using one serializer for both. It appears to take whatever method comes first alphabetically and uses its serializer for both methods. What I expect is that the serializer annotated on the first method is used for the first method, and the serializer annotated on the second method is used on the second method. Debugging appears to indicate that Jackson has the serializers in a map keyed by return type of the method (which is the same for both).An Example: Any suggestions on how to get the getFoos() method to serialize with a FooSerializer, and the getBars() method to serialize with the BarSerializer? In this example, the BarSerializer is invoked for both methods.Note, if I change the signature of one of the methods to another collection type so they are different - List<String> for example - the serialization works.Thanks in advance. <code>  public class FooBar { private Set<String> foos = new HashSet<String>(); private Set<String> bars = new HashSet<String>(); @JsonProperty(""FooWrapper"") @JsonSerialize(contentUsing = FooSerializer.class) public Set<String> getFoos() { return foos; } @JsonProperty(""BarWrapper"") @JsonSerialize(contentUsing = BarSerializer.class) public Set<String> getBars() { return bars; }}",Multiple Jackson Serializers of Same Return Type

Android: how to make the datepicker divider green?," I've got a datepicker in my Android app, but now I want to change the color of the blue dividers into green (see the image below this text). There are some other discussions on Stackoverflow that talk about the same, but none of them gives an answer which leads to a solution.So I went looking myself and found there is actually an android:datePickerStyle and there is also an android:divider. I don't know however, whether the divider is actually referring to the divider in the datepicker at all. I tried a multitude of combinations of the two, but I don't seem to get it to work. So my first question: Does the android:divider refer to the divider in the datepicker, and how could I use it to change color?So another option is supposedly to create a fully new custom datepicker. If that enables me to just change the color of the divider I'm down for it. So I had a look at some of the tutorials on creating a custom datepicker, but none of them seem to define the color of the dividers. The dividers are simply not listed in the xml files or in the java files.It would be great if there would be some kind of boilerplate code to recreate the datepicker as it currently displays, including the code that sets the color of the dividers. Hopefully that would enable me to copy it and simply change the color setting of the divider somewhere. So my second question: Would anybody know any boilerplate code which simply implements the datepicker as it is now (including a definition of the dividers)? <code> ",Android: how to change the color of the datepicker divider?

Default timezone for DateTime deserialization with Jackson (Joda module)," This question is about deserialization to Joda-Time DateTime using jackson-datatype-joda module for Jackson. Is there a default timezone that date strings will be deserialized into? If so, what is it? Is it UTC?I need to ask this because the Jackson documentation is not specific for Joda-Time DateTime. I found in this article (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonFAQDateHandling) that Jackson will assume GMT as the default time zone for deserializing into java.util.Date or java.util.Calendar. However, there is no mention of Joda-Time data types in this document. In addition, I specifically need strings to deserialize into DateTime objects using the UTC timezone, not GMT: although these two zones are very similar, there are some small differences and therefore GMT will not be feasible for me.Thank you. <code> ",Default timezone for DateTime deserialization with Jackson (Joda-Time module)

Resolution stage of Java class loading," I just finished reading through the Java Virtual Machine Specification and the section on class loading left me puzzled. As far as I understood it in general and after reading the specification, I thought that the overall instantiation of a class consisted of the following steps in the following order:Creation / Loading: The class loader locates a stream of bytes representing the class, either a file or a network stream or whatever one implements a class loader to fetch. If no class can be found, a ClassNotFoundException is thrown. At this point, there is already some basic validation happening where a ClassFormatError is thrown if the byte array does not represent a Java class (for example, the magic number is missing) or an UnsupportedClassVersionError if the class version is not supported by the running JVM instance.Linking: The class is hooked into the JVM. If something goes wrong, a subclass of LinkageError is thrown. Linking consists of the three substeps:Verification: It is made sure that the byte stream represents a Java class as for example that the byte code without formal errors such as overflowing operand stacks for the method byte code. If a class fails verification, a VerifyError is thrown.Preparation: The JVM allocates memory for all static fields and might create an instance template for speeding up instance creation. Virtual method tables are created. No class loading specific errors are be thrown on this stage. (An OutOfMemoryError might be thrown though.)Resolution: All symbolic references that were now loaded into the method area in form of the runtime constant pool are resolved to actual types loaded by this JVM. If a symbolic reference can be resolved but results in a conflict of definitions, a IncompatibleClassChangeError is thrown. If a referenced class cannot be found, a NoClassDefFoundError is thrown which basically wraps a ClassNotFoundException that was thrown by the class loader attempting to load this referenced class. If a referenced class references itself, a ClassCircularityError is thrown. Resolution can happen in one of two flavors which is up to the implementors of the JVMEager: All symbolic references to other fields, methods or classes are resolved right now.Lazy: Resolving of symbolic references is postponed until the first use of a method. This might bring with it that a class refering to a non-existant class never throws an error if this reference never needs to be resolved. Initialization: The class's static initializers that are defined in the class as Java code are run. If an exception is caused by such an initializer, this exception is rethrown wrapped in an ExceptionInInitializerError.What puzzles me is the resolution phase of the above class loading mechanism. Why is resolution defined as an explicit step within linking which occurs specifically after preparation? Already within the description of the class loading phase, it is mentioned that If C has any direct superinterfaces, the symbolic references from C to its direct superinterfaces are resolved using the algorithm of 5.4.3.1.Are symbolic references not also resolved while verification occurs since verification is described: Verification (4.10) ensures that the binary representation of a class or interface is structurally correct (4.9). Verification may cause additional classes and interfaces to be loaded (5.3) but need not cause them to be verified or prepared.I always have this picture in mindSource: http://www.programcreek.comwhich I have seen at almost any place explaining class loading. Should resolution not rather be seen as an overall responsibility which is part of all phases, creation/loading, verification, linking and initialization (since resolution can be done lazily). Currently, I would argue that it would make sense to take the resolution stage out of this image and declare it a general procedure that can be used at any time since information about other classes might be required at any stage such that the loading of such a class is required what necessarily also requires the resolution of the symbolic reference to this class. From the shown picture, it looks like resolution is only happening at a specific point in a chain of separate events.I suspect that this depiction of resolution being a dedicated step maybe just legacy from a time where resolution was never conducted lazily but had its place where all remaining symbolic references were resolved.What I want to know: Should resolution in today's JVMs be understood the way I described it? Or am I wrong about this and resolution can still be understood as a dedicated step in a fixed time line just as the image shows it? <code> ",Where does the resolution stage of Java class loading actually start?

Guice Provider as Singleton," Should Guice Providers be annotated with @Singleton? My justification: if the Provider is providing an object to other Singleton classes and the object itself is relatively expensive to create, then wouldn't it make sense to use a Singleton Provider that constructs the expensive object in its @Inject-marked constructor, store it as a member and just return that already-saved global variable in the getter? Something like this: UpdateLet me clarify a little bit more here. This is not about whether I should be using @Singleton or .in(Singleton.class). This has to do more with the ""caching"" of the created object.Let's say that object creation required multiple RPCs to complete, such as deserializing JSON or making HTTP requests. This could take quite some time. If I am going to use this Provider to inject into classes multiple times, then doesn't it make sense to only create such an object once?Also note that I must be able to use a Provider because I need to be able to inject into the Provider. <code>  @Singletonpublic class MyProvider extends Provider<ExpensiveObject> { private ExpensiveObject obj; @Inject public MyProvider() { /* Create the expensive object here, set it to this.obj */ } @Override public ExpensiveObject get() { return obj; }}",Should Guice Providers with expensive member instances as be annotated with @Singleton?

This is useful if you wish to create an association to an object without actually loading it from the database. It also allows multiple instances to be loaded as a batch if batch-size is defined for the class mapping.Please help me to understand this by explaining the meaning of the parts highlighted above in bold. <code> ",What is proxy in the context of load() method of Hibernate?

How Java resolves relative path in new File()," I am trying to understand the way Java resolves relative path in while creating a File object.OS used: WindowsFor the below snippet, I am getting an IOException as it cannot find the path: My understanding here is, Java treats the path provided as absolute and returns an error when the path does not exist. So it makes sense.When I update the above code to use relative path: It creates a new file and provides the below output: In this case, my assumption is, even though the path provided doesn't exist, because the path contains ""/../"", java treats this as a relative path and creates the file in the user.dir. So this also makes sense.But if I update the relative path as below: Then I get IOException: Access is denied.My questions are:why ""test/../test.txt"" is treated as a relative path and creates the file in ""user.dir"" but""test/../../test.txt"" returns an error? Where does it attempt to create the file for the path ""test/../../test.txt""?When the specified relative path is not found, the file seems to be created in the user.dir. So, it appears to me that the below two scenarios does the same thing: So is there a real world case where one would use scenario 1 instead of scenario 2? I suppose I am missing something obvious here or have fundamentally misunderstood relative paths. I went through the Java docs for File and I am not able to find an explanation for this. There are quite a few questions posted in Stack Overflow regarding relative paths, but the ones I looked up were for specific scenarios and not exactly about how relative paths are resolved. It will be great if someone could please explain me how this works or point to some related links? <code>  @Testpublic void testPathConversion() { File f = new File(""test/test.txt""); try { f.createNewFile(); System.out.println(f.getPath()); System.out.println(f.getAbsolutePath()); System.out.println(f.getCanonicalPath()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }} @Test public void testPathConversion() { File f = new File(""test/../test.txt""); try { f.createNewFile(); System.out.println(f.getPath()); System.out.println(f.getAbsolutePath()); System.out.println(f.getCanonicalPath()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } test\..\test.txtC:\JavaForTesters\test\..\test.txtC:\JavaForTesters\test.txt @Test public void testPathConversion() { File f = new File(""test/../../test.txt""); try { f.createNewFile(); System.out.println(f.getPath()); System.out.println(f.getAbsolutePath()); System.out.println(f.getCanonicalPath()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } //scenario 1File f = new File(""test/../test.txt"");f.createNewFile();//scenario 2File f = new File(""test.txt"");f.createNewFile();",How does Java resolve a relative path in new File()?
Why does InputStream read() return int and not a short?," I was reading the byte stream trial and noticed the following statement Notice that read() returns an int value. If the input is a stream of bytes, why doesn't read() return a byte value? Using a int as a return type allows read() to use -1 to indicate that it has reached the end of the stream.The given reason for using an int is that they can identify EOF by a -1. (seems shallow)So the next bigger primitive type is short and it also supports -1 so why not use it?From what i gather: (reasons to use int)Due to performance int is preferred.(this)int variable holds a character value in its last 16 bits (fromcharactertrial)Other more abstract streams would need to read more than just onebyte (something that i guess (happens with character streams))Are my reasons correct?

"Making a robust, resizable Chess GUI"," How would I go about making this resizable Chess GUI?Our company has been tasked with making a Chess game. It needs to work on Windows, OS X and Linux/Unix machines, and we have chosen Java to achieve this, while maintaining a common code-base (handy for both maintenance, and keeping costs down). My task is to create the GUI. The User Design Team has cleared the following spec. with the client. The chess game (Chess Champ) will be robust to resizing and straightforward, it includes: A tool-bar at the top, with UI components: New button Save button Restore button Resign button A label for providing messages to the player. On the left hand side of the game, we need an area which will be reserved for future use, it might include things like: Lists of captured pieces A selector for choice of piece when promoting pawns Game statistics Hints, etc. The details of this are are still being settled with the client and the Logic Team. So for the moment, simply mark it with a label containing ? as text. The rest of the GUI will consist of the chess board itself. It will have: The main area for the chess board. If the user points at a chess piece, it should show focus with a border. It should also be keyboard accessible. The client will be supplying multiple sprite sheets of chess pieces (of a variety of sizes, styles and colors) to allow the user to change the look of the game. The chess board will have labels indicating the columns (left to right: A, B, C, D, E, F, G & H) and rows (top to bottom: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 & 1). The chess board and column/row labels will be bordered by a 1px black border, with an 8px padding around that. As the player increases the size of the game, the chess board should remain square, but otherwise fill the available space. The background color behind the chess board should be ochre, but in the mock-ups below we have made the area behind the chess board green in order to highlight the resize behavior.

Jersey 2 on Jboss7," Has anyone had success deploying Jersey 2.x with JBoss 7.x? I've tried deploying Jersey 2.5 with JBoss 7.1.1 but encountered errors like: I believe this issue is because JBoss comes bundled with RestEasy which is a JAX-RS 1.0 implementation while Jersey is a JAX-RS 2.0 implementation. So I took the following steps to disable RestEasy:1) Added the following to my web.xml: 2) Followed the discussion here, I modified my JBoss' standalone.xml, module.xml, and domain.xml to remove all references to JAXRS1.1 / RestEasy.3) This led to another error: ""java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/objectweb/asm/ClassVisitor"" which I resolved by adding the following to my pom.xml: So finally my app deploys without errors but now I cannot seem to access any of my Jersey resources. Jetty 8 works fine, however.

STOMP vs WAMP over WebSocket," I am currently working on a project that needs to work with WebSockets.The clients will be the browsers only, so not interested in any message broker feature of these two.Although I don't think that it would be much a difference, but would be interested if I can get a few comments on STOMP vs WAMP as a subprotocol using Spring-WebSockets.

persistant GC issues with cassandra -- long app pauses," We are using a 3 site, 3 nodes per site Cassandra 1.1.12 cluster that has 8GB ram allocated per node. We have been seeing long GC pauses on nodes periodically and that is messing with our applications realtime requirements. The systems we run on are 8 core systems with 24GB of ram.We've been seeing 120+ second pauses where it does a stop the world GC. We are running with these flags on JDK 1.7.0_04 Here is the detailed GC log leading up to the long pause: I also have setup a nightly job that forces GC on the instance at 2am in hopes that it would alleviate these problems -- and it has done some good, but we're still having problems every few days with nodes.-- Added detailAfter changing NewGen to 2GB (From 1600M), we saw a 15 second pause within first 12 hours of running....

Using regex in java to remove a dollar sign and comma from a currency field within a field in a column delimited file.," I am having a bit of a challenge trying to remove the dollar sign and thousands separator (comma in my case) from a currency field that resides on a record in a comma delimited file using the string.replaceAll command.Removing the dollar sign and comma (all commas) is no problem, but the comma field delimiters need to stay and here lies my challenge. I have spend a bit of time researching this and am spinning my wheels. Below is a pattern for the type of record being read in and what I would like to look like after. Before - fieldA, fieldB, fieldC, $1,000.00, fieldD, FieldEAfter - fieldA, fieldB, fieldC, 1000.00, fieldD, fieldEOr would I be better off not using a regex pattern?Any help is greatly appreciated. <code> ",Using regex in java to remove a dollar sign and comma from a currency field within a field in a column delimited file

Thanks in advance. <code>  public class HomeActivity extends Activity implements WebClientResponseListener { private User user; @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { //.... // I call my class and add this as a listener: MyWebServiceClient mws = new MyWebServiceClient(getApplicationContext()); mws.getProducts(this.user.getToken(), this) } //.... @Override public void onDataDownloadSuccess(JSONObject jsonObject) { Log.d(""DATA"", ""SUCCESS""); }} private void sendRequest() { AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this); builder.setTitle(getString(R.string.request_info_title)); builder.setItems(items, this); //..... builder.create().show();} public void onClick(DialogInterface dialogInterface, int which) { MyWebServiceClient mws = new MyWebServiceClient(getApplicationContext()); mws.getProducts(user.getToken(), this)} //in OnClickmws.getProducts(user.getToken(), HomeActivity.this); homeActivity = this;",Get Activity (this) inside setOnClickListener

improving Field.set performance using MethodHandles?," I'm writing some code that calls Field.set and Field.get many many thousands of times.

JPA 2 - How to increment a numeric field for some record only," I have a JPA 2 web application (Struts 2, Hibernate 4 as JPA implementation only).The current requirement is to add a (non-id) numeric sequential field, filled for certain rows only, to an existing entity. When inserting a new row, based on a certain condition, I need to set the new field to its highest value + 1 or to NULL.For example: In the good old SQL, it would be something like: But I've no clue on how to achieve it with JPA 2.I know I can define callbacks methods, but JSR-000317 Persistence Specification for Eval 2.0 Eval discourages some specific operations from inside it: 3.5 Entity Listeners and Callback Methods - Lifecycle callbacks can invoke JNDI, JDBC, JMS, and enterprise beans. - In general, the lifecycle method of a portable application should not invoke EntityManager or Query operations, access other entity instances, or modify relationships within the same persistence context.[43] A lifecycle callback method may modify the non-relationship state of the entity on which it is invoked. [43] The semantics of such operations may be standardized in a future release of this specification.Summarizing, yes to JDBC (!) and EJB, no to EntityManager and other Entities.EDITI'm trying to achieve the solution described in the answer from @anttix, but I'm encoutering some problem, so please correct me where I'm wrong.Table Main Entity Sub entity DAO Exception Caused by: javax.transaction.RollbackException: ARJUNA016053: Could not commit transaction.

Read files from disk image," I already asked something similar here several months ago, but of course the solution used in my update is not good, because I don't know at which offset starts the file I want, that code reads the entire file until it finds the wanted string and that's not convenient. That's why I searched for an ISO9660 File reader coded in Java and I came accross this project which reads perfectly ISO9660 files, but there are some file formats like binand imgthat I'd like to be able to open.Unfortunately, the code doesn't work because it expects the ISO9660 header \x01CD001\x01 at a prefixed offset (32768, right after the first 16 sectors, reserved for other purposes) as defined by the standard here and here:7. The First Sixteen Sectors are EmptyThe first sixteen sectors (sector numbers 0 to 15, inclusive) contain nothing but zeros. ISO9660 does not define the contents of these sectors, but for DOS they are apparently always written as zeros. They are apparently reserved for use by systems that can be booted from a CD-ROM.In my case, i have img and bindisk images that have the \x01CD001\x01 header at offset 37656, 792 bytes after the end of the 18th sector. This makes the code throw an error.Since there are softwares able to read the contents of a binand imgfile without the need of cueor ccd file, what's the rule to fild the header in such cases? Is it a standard or do they brutally search the header through the bytes? If it's a standard where can I find any kind of documentation/implementation?UPDATE: I found out that those files have a different sector size: 2352 bytes/sector, because they are raw copies of the CD-R. <code> ",Read files from raw disk image (2352 bytes/sector)

Is Java Swing rendering broken in JDK 1.8?," I have installed IntelliJ IDEA (13.1.1 #IC-135.480) and JDK 1.8.0 (x64) and I generated some GUI with the GUI Form designer. Then I ran the code and realized that something is not alright. Here is a Screenshot of my GUI:The rendering of the Font seems to be not OK. Additionally the Button looses its Text, when I move my mouse over it.So I installed JDK 1.7.0_40 (x64), recompiled the Project and ran it again.The following Form appears, when i use JDK 1.7:The Rendering seems to be OK and the Button is also OK.So I installed the newest Graphics and Chipset drivers and much more, but the problem still exists.Have you ever had such problems with Java Swing UIs? Could you help me to fix my problems? Any help would be greatly appreciated.UPDATE:I created a small Project with only 1 JTextArea and 1 JButton and i have the same rendering problems.According to Andrew Thompson i changed the setSize() and I start from EDT. The Example below: The result is a simple JFrame with the Components in it.When I write some Text, or moove my mousePointer over the Button the components get rendered like this (Text: testsentence.123; Button-Label: TestButton) <code>  package at.maeh.java.client.simpleTextClient;import javax.swing.*;import java.awt.*;public class SimpleClient extends JFrame { private JPanel panel1; private JTextArea textArea1 = new JTextArea(); private JButton button1 = new JButton(); public SimpleClient() { super(""SimpleClient""); // Panel panel1 = new JPanel(); panel1.setLayout(new FlowLayout()); // BUtton button1.setText(""TestButton""); // TextArea textArea1.setColumns(40); textArea1.setRows(15); // Add Components panel1.add(textArea1); panel1.add(button1); // Add to Frame this.getContentPane().add(panel1); // pack and set Visible pack(); setVisible(true); System.out.println(""Constructor EDT: "" + SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread()); } public static void main(String[] args) { SwingUtilities.invokeLater(SimpleClient::new); System.out.println(""Main EDT: "" + SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread()); }}","Swing rendering appears broken in JDK 1.8, correct in JDK 1.7"

Best Practice to distribute a eclipse setup for a project?," I'm looking for some best practices to rollout/setup a complete project setup with Eclipse to my dev team. It's a maven based project that will work without Eclipse. But we want to distribute a preconfigure Eclipse version that have all plugins installed, we want to have a local update site to rollout update of this setup and so on. Is there any good way to achieve this kind of setup? I know that i can provide a update site which contain some plugins, but can i define a set of plugins?Is it possible that Eclipse pmd, Checkstyle, Findbugs and the code formatter use the settings from Maven?Here are the two most important questions for me: How to define a plugin set for an Eclipse installation, so that all developers have the same set of plugins installed. Any way to use the configurations from pmd, Findbugs, Checkstyle and code formatter from Maven to be used inside eclipse  <code> ",Best Practice to distribute a Eclipse setup for a project?

library for queueing data for server dispatch on android or java," I am working on an android app with an email feature. I want my users to be able to compose and send emails while in airplane mode. For that I need some sort of queue that can check if there is network and send, etc. I image this must have been done 100s of times. But I am not really sure why my searches aren't turning up much. Does anyone know of a library or git project that I can use to accomplish this? If not, does anyone know how to accomplish this?I believe it is called the Queue and send pattern.UpdateI am starting a bounty on this question. What I hope for is a working example that does not use SMS. For my particular case I am working on an Appengine Connected Android Project. The client needs to send data (String, Bitmap, etc under a particular POJO say Dog) to the server. I want to be able to queue up these data somehow. I can use Gson to save data to file, etc. The bottom line is that I need to be able to check for network. When there is network I dequeue my queue into the server. If there is no network, I keep saving into the queue.My queue can be Queue<Dog>, where Dog is my class with fields such as Bitmap (or path to image), String, long, etc.I am looking for a working example. It can be very simple, but the example must work. A git zip would be great. I am giving up close to half of my points for this question. <code>  class Dog{ String dogname; String pathToImage; int dogAge; //etc.}//Design pattern for sending Dog to server0) Unmarshall queue from file using Gson1) Add dog to queue2) If there is network, loop through queue and send data to server3) if there is no network save queue to file//Ideally, as soon as there is network, the method should be able to detect so and run to send data to server",How to queue up data for server dispatch on android

How do I launch a spring-boot application witjout the embedded tomcat?," I have a Spring Boot application which was generated using jhipster, and it works fine.

Java8: How Lambda Expressions Are Translate In Java Byte Code.," I am trying to create an example using lambda expression in java and i am using offical JDK8. My example was run successfully. But when i trying to check how the compiler translate lambda expression into byte code, this makes me some confusion.Following is the code of my example:- In this Article, they discuss about how compiler translate the lambda expressions into byte code. According to this document the lambda expression convert into static method and the location where lambda expression declare, have reference of lambda static method. The following example is in the article : My example run fine and give us the appropriate result. But when i trying to run the javap command for check the byte code of class, there is no static method for lambdas in byte code. In the case of generics, bridge method is created by compiler and we will also check this method using javap command, but in the case of lambdas there is no static method. The article was published at 2012 and java 8 was launch at march 2014. So i have some queries regarding transnational of lambda: Is there any new implementation used for lambda in JDK 8 after this article release or i will do something wrong to check the lambda method ?How really the compiler deal with lambda expression?How the JVM invoke the lambda exression ?  <code>  public class LambdaTest { public Integer lambdaBinaryOpertor(BinaryOperator<Integer> binaryOperator) { return binaryOperator.apply(60, 72); } public static void main(String[] args) { LambdaTest test = new LambdaTest(); BinaryOperator<Integer> binaryOperator = (a, b) -> a*b; System.out.println(""Additon using Lambda BinaryOperator: ""+test.lambdaBinaryOpertor(binaryOperator)); }} //Source codeclass A { public void foo() { List<String> list = ... list.forEach( s -> { System.out.println(s); } ); }} //After compile above code ""translate code "" class A { public void foo() { List<String> list = ... list.forEach( [lambda for lambda$1 as Block] ); } static void lambda$1(String s) { System.out.println(s); }} c:\>javap LambdaTestCompiled from ""LambdaTest.java""public class LambdaTest {public LambdaTest();public java.lang.Integer lambdaBinaryOpertor(java.util.function.BinaryOperator <java.lang.Integer>);public static void main(java.lang.String[]);}",How Lambda Expressions Are Translate In Java Byte Code

JCombobox disable item selection," I'd like to create a readonly combobox. The user should not be able to select another item from the popup list. That means that the popup list should not open or should be empty.I see the following solutions:Set a ComboBox model with only one item (the current selected item) so when the user clicks on the arrow button, an empty list is presented. Add a PopupMenuListener and in the popupMenuWillBecomeVisible hide the menu. This is problematic: We have to call combo.hidePopup(); from within a SwingUtilities.invokeLater()The empty model approach seems a little bit clunky. The second approach shows the popup list for a fraction of a second, short enough to be noticed. This is very ugly.Is there a third solution?EDIT: Implemented solution:I implemented the suggested method from splungebob and here is my code for future reference: The only problem is the Key-Event Alt-Down which oppens the popup menu even if I remove all the key listeners and clear the action map. I circumvent this problem by making the combo non focusable. Not ideal but good enough (-: <code>  private void makeComboReadonly() { Component editorComponent = box.getEditor().getEditorComponent(); if (editorComponent instanceof JTextField) { ((JTextField) editorComponent).setEditable(false); } for (Component childComponent : box.getComponents()) { if (childComponent instanceof AbstractButton) { childComponent.setEnabled(false); final MouseListener[] listeners = childComponent.getListeners(MouseListener.class); for (MouseListener listener : listeners) { childComponent.removeMouseListener(listener); } } } final MouseListener[] mouseListeners = box.getListeners(MouseListener.class); for (MouseListener listener : mouseListeners) { box.removeMouseListener(listener); } final KeyListener[] keyListeners = box.getListeners(KeyListener.class); for (KeyListener keyListener : keyListeners) { box.removeKeyListener(keyListener); } box.setFocusable(false); //box.getActionMap().clear(); //no effect //box.getInputMap().clear();}",JCombobox disable item selection (make combo readonly)

Java to Lua socket communication error.," Okay, so I have a project where I'm working with a Client (written in Lua) and a Server (written in Java). I'm using LuaSocket for the client and DatagramSockets for the server. The problem is when I send one string from the client in Lua, and receive it on the server(and convert the bytes to a string), it doesn't recognize the value of the string as equal to what it should be(I'm using .equals() for evaluation). I've printed the result and compared it to the string(everything checked out); I've even compared the bytes (using .getBytes()), they even checked out. The most annoying part of this is that when I analyze the string with .startsWith() it evaluates true, but nothing else works. I've looked into the string encoding of both languages, but I'm relatively new to sockets and this is beyond me.Edit:Upon writing some example code to demonstrate the problem, I solved it. Here is the code:Client: Server: The result: The string I had been examining the bytes from previously was split at several points, and that would explain why I didn't notice this. <code>  local socket = require ""socket""local udp = socket.udp()udp:settimeout(0)udp:setpeername(""localhost"", 1234)udp:send(""foo"") public class Main { public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception { DatagramSocket server = new DatagramSocket(1234); byte[] incomingBytes = new byte[512]; DatagramPacket incomingPacket = new DatagramPacket(incomingBytes, incomingBytes.length); server.receive(incomingPacket); String received = new String(incomingBytes); System.out.println(received); System.out.println(received.equals(""foo"")); for (byte b : received.getBytes()) { System.out.print(b + "" ""); } System.out.print(""\n""); for (byte b : ""foo"".getBytes()) { System.out.print(b + "" ""); } System.out.print(""\n""); }} foofalse102 111 111 0 0 0 *I'm not going to include all but there are 506 more* 102 111 111 ",Java to Lua socket communication error
Design pattern for cumulative exception," Let's imagine, that we have a process, which accepts data of the following type: This data should be validated formally: value of date should be aparseable date, url should also conform the normal url syntax.Also, this data should be validated logically: date should be in the future, url should be an accessibleaddress, returning 200 OK.To make it clean, one must separate those two validation routines into different units (classes, utils, whatever). The desired final behaviour, however, must give user clear understanding of ALL violations, that are present in data. Something like: {""Errors"":[ ""Specified date is not in the future"",//Formal validation failed ""Specified URL has invalid syntax""//Logical validation failed ]}I have seen some implementations of the required behaviour, but theyuse those make use of Error objects and are full of checks likeError.hasErrors() or error==null, which does not look elegant.I have also seen the implementation of javax.validation, which gives you all violations on all field at once. Same approach could be implemented for content validation, but I am not sure, that this is the best way to do this. Question: what is the best practice for handling multiple exceptions/violations of various nature?UPD: short digest of answers: collect Violations, build an Exception, containing their context, cause and description, use an interceptor to render. See reference links from answers:http://beanvalidation.org/1.0/spec/ JSR 303 specificationhttp://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/validation.html Spring Bean Validationhttp://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gircz.html Java EE validationWhich Design Pattern To Use For ValidationWhy not use exceptions as regular flow of control? <code>  {""date"":""2014-05-05"", ""url"":""http://some.website.com"",""counter"":3}",Design pattern for cumulative validation violations

how to verify programmaticly that log4j 2 was properly configured," From reading the log4j 2 documentation it is expected that the configuration will be loaded if the appropriate configuration file is in classpath. But I need to know for sure that the configuration file was properly processed. Is there a way I can verify that the configuration file I expected to be loaded was in fact found and successfully loaded? I am writing code that will be used by other developers and it could be the case that log4j 2, which is integral to the library we are writing, was not properly configured, because the file was not in classpath or misconfigured. If log4j 2 is not properly configured than I must halt further processing of our library, it must spit out major errors and big deal must be made about it. I cannot let the code continue. So the bottom-line, I need to know that log4j 2 properly processed the expected configuration file.Also, I would prefer to use the log4j 2 API and not the Core library, but if Core is the only way then so be it. <code> ",How do I programmatically verify that log4j 2 was properly configured?

How to produce a compilation error on implicit long to double convertion?," Is there a way to get the Java compiler to produce an error when a ""long"" is implicitly converted to a ""double"", as this can cause data loss?EDIT: The reason I cannot accept the answer from Alex, is that it defeats my purpose. What I want to do is create a minimal ""functor"" API, that does not cause garbage by directly supporting primitive types too, instead of only supporting object types using generics. But to keep the number of interfaces small, I want to use as few types as possible. With just double and Object, for parameters and return value, I support (almost) all types without causing garbage, nor loosing any data (boolean does not convert to double, but does not cause garbage by autoboxing either, AFAIK, so it's OK not to support it explicitly). Since all primitive types, except boolean and long, can safely, and implicitly be converted to double, I have almost all my needs covered.That is where the question comes from: if I don't add explicit support for long in that API, how to prevent long being used at all, as it would leading to bugs? And of course, using java.lang.Double instead of double would cause garbage, and therefore make the API pointless.Before anyone asks, I'll say that I want to use the API in real-time Android games where ""garbage"" is a real issue, unlike the JVM. <code> ",How to produce a compilation error on implicit long to double conversion?
Log4J RollingFileAppender Inconsistent MaxFileSize," I am writing a small xml transformation layer in Java. I receive xml via web service, modify it, and then send the modified xml to another system. I then wait for a response and return the response to the original caller. I want to log the request I receive, the request I send, the response I receive, and the request I send. Basically I want to log the xml where each arrow is in my diagram.My problem is with the RollingFileAppender. I try to roll at 10MB, sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't roll. If it rolls a couple times, and then stops, it will continue to rename the rolled files from 3 to 4 and 4 to 5 and so on.My best guess is that when the 10MB mark is crossed, there are multiple threads writing to the log file so the file cannot me renamed. I am hoping that Log4J has an easy solution for this, but if necessary, I am open to switching to a new logging framework. Thank you in advance for any help.EDITHere is my properties file.

Generated WS client will not build with JDK8," I have a very simple (existing) web service that I would like to generate a web service client against using JDK8.I'm using a pure JDK8 tool chain meaning I use the wsimport tool from my JDK8 dir.Now to the problem: The Java source code generated by the wsimport tool in JDK8 is not JDK8 Javadoc compliant. As you may be aware the Javadoc tool has become a lot more strict in JDK8.Consider the following simple schema: For this the wsimport tool will generate Java code as follows: The problem is the generated comments for this class. While this type of comments would be accepted by the Javadoc compiler in JDK7 it no longer works in JDK8. (the end > must be replaced by &gt; in order for it to be correct in JDK8). The result of these invalid comments is that the build fails.I know I can turn off doclint in JDK8 but I wonder if I'm doing something wrong here. It's just pure JDK8 tools. Nothing fancy. These tools are supposed to work together right? and have been thoroughly tested with each other before being released by Oracle? So I'm assuming I'm doing something wrong. Like what?Thanks.STEPS TO REPRODUCELink to WSDL (includes schema)Download this file to somewhere on your harddrive.I use a wsimport command line like this: Now run javadoc on the generated sources: You'll see something like this: Note that Javadoc tool also produces a bunch of WARNINGs.

Comunication between several classes," Whenever I make a program I tend to divide different sections in different files, I think it looks more neat that way. To make the problem more concrete say I have this dummy code consisting of four classes, The Alpha and Beta classes communicate with the Gamma. The purpose of the integers is to print out their values and compare them with each other after the setters have been called from the different classes. A general problem I have when I split the sections is that when one class change the values in Gamma, the other classes have obsolete values, the x,y,z variables will still have the old values of x in Gamma when a setter method has been called, unless I discover this before spending quite some time finding it.I tend to circumvent this by passing around one reference of the Gamma class, like so, and spend several lines of code to update everything. Where the reference is being created from the ""main"" class, where ""main"" is not necessarily the class with the main method, but the class where the most action is. The question I have is, is there a standard way of dealing with this kind of problem, where multiple classes communicate with one other class, changing values etc. and ending up with obsolete values?My problems tend to be more subtle than what is shown but essentially this is what I tend to spend some time on trying to fix. I am sorry if the explanation is muddy, I had a hard time to make the problem this clear, if it is too incomprehensible, write in the comments where and I will try to clear it a bit more clearer. <code>  public class dummy { public static void main(String[] args){ Alpha a = new Alpha(); Beta b = new Beta(); Gamma g = new Gamma(); int x,y,z,j,k,l,o,p,q; x = a.getGammaX(); y = b.getGammaX(); z = g.getX(); a.setGammaX(1); j = a.getGammaX(); k = b.getGammaX(); l = g.getX(); b.setGammaX(2); o = a.getGammaX(); p = b.getGammaX(); q = g.getX(); } }class Alpha{ Gamma g = new Gamma(); public int getGammaX(){ return g.getX(); } public void setGammaX(int x){ g.setX(x); }}class Beta{ Gamma g = new Gamma(); public int getGammaX(){ return g.getX(); } public void setGammaX(int x){ g.setX(x); }}class Gamma{ int x = 10; public int getX(){ return x; } public void setX(int y){ x = y; }} Gamma g = new Gamma();Alpha a = new Alpha(g);Beta b = new Beta(g);",Communication between several classes

Why Major Garbage collection is faster than Minor?," Gone thru this link but stillhas confusion what actually happens in minor and major GC collection.Say i have 100 objects in younger generation out of which 85 object are unreachabe objects. Now when Minor GC runs,it will reclaim the memory of 85 objects and move 15 objects to older(tenured) generation. Now 15 live objects exists in older generation out of which 3 are unreachable. Say Major GC takes places. It will keep15 objects as it is and reclaim the memory for 3 unreachable object. Major GC is said to be slower than minor GC. My question is why ? Is it because of major GC happens on generally greater number of objects than minor as minor gc occurs more frequently than major? As per understanding major GC should be faster as it needs to do less work i.e reclaiming memory from unreachable objects than minor GC becausehigh mortality rate in young generation.  <code> ",Why Major Garbage collection is slower than Minor?
Java IO vs NIO what is really difference," I'm quite fond of Java NIO and I really want to apply Java NIO to my current system, but when I created these samples application to compare between Java IO and NIO, it made me quite disappointed.Here are my 2 samples (I don't put all the source code)Java IO Java NIO Client The Client when run will create 10 clients connect to the server. After I run and monitored several times, I found no different between Java IO and NIO.If changed number of clients to 500, I found that the java IO really created 500 threads, however the consumption of data really fast. In contrast, the java NIO application had much fewer threads than the other, but the consumption of data was slow and it took longer time to finish everything.So, what is really the benefit of Java NIO?

How to define a custom AuthenticationEntryPoint without xml configuration," I've been struggling for a few days now.

Since this is a REST service it shouldn't.The documentation for FormLoginConfigurer (the class .formLogin() uses) says: Shared Objects Created The following shared objects are populated But couldn't find a way to override it.Any ideas?P.S.Don't think it would be a good idea to override the login form to a custom one that only returns the error. <code>  <http entry-point-ref=""restAuthenticationEntryPoint""> <intercept-url pattern=""/api/admin/**"" access=""ROLE_ADMIN""/> <form-login authentication-success-handler-ref=""mySuccessHandler"" authentication-failure-handler-ref=""myFailureHandler"" /> <logout /></http> @Configuration@Order(1) public static class RestWebSecurityConfigurationAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter { @Override protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception { if (restAuthenticationEntryPoint == null) { restAuthenticationEntryPoint = new RestAuthenticationEntryPoint(); } http .authorizeRequests() .antMatchers(""/**"").hasAnyRole(Sec.ADMIN,Sec.SUPER_USER)... .and() .httpBasic() .authenticationEntryPoint(restAuthenticationEntryPoint) .and() .formLogin() .successHandler(mySavedRequestAwareAuthenticationSuccessHandler) .failureHandler(simpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler) AuthenticationEntryPoint",How to define a custom AuthenticationEntryPoint without XML configuration

Note that the Amazon documentation (not the blog) does not have the typo error and also refers to an up-to-date binary.Edit 2: With the correct dash, the argument is interpreted by java, but I still got a (different) error message during runtime: SEVERE: [sqlite] SQLiteQueue[AKID_eu-west-1.db]: error running job queue com.almworks.sqlite4java.SQLiteException: [-91] cannot load library: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no sqlite4java-osx-x86_64 in java.library.pathI fixed it like that: It's now finally working...

Performance issue : Java vs C++," I have always heard that C++ was way more efficient than Java (and that is why most games are developed in C++).I wrote a small algorithm to solve the ""Eight queens puzzle"" in both Java and C++, using the exact same algorithm, and then started to raise the number or squares.When reaching checkboards of 20*20 or even 22*22, it appears Java is much more effective (3 seconds vs 66 seconds for C++).I have no idea why, but I am pretty beginning with C++, so it is possible I made some huge performance mistakes, so I will gladly accept any information that would help me understand what is happening.Below is the code I use in Java: And below is the code in C++: <code>  import java.awt.Point;import java.util.ArrayList;import java.util.List;public class HuitDames { /** * La liste des coordnnes des dames. */ private static List<Point> positions = new ArrayList<>(); /** * Largeur de la grille. */ private static final int LARGEUR_GRILLE = 22; /** * @param args the command line arguments */ public static void main(String[] args) { int i = 1; placerDame(i); for (Point point : positions) { System.out.println(""("" + point.x + ""; "" + point.y + "")""); } } /** * Place une dame et return true si la position est bonne. * @param i le numro de la dame. * @return si la position est bonne. */ private static boolean placerDame(int i) { boolean bonnePosition = false; for (int j = 1; j <= LARGEUR_GRILLE && bonnePosition == false; j++) { Point emplacement = new Point(i, j); positions.add(emplacement); if (verifierPrise(emplacement) && (i == LARGEUR_GRILLE || placerDame(i + 1))) { bonnePosition = true; } else { positions.remove(i - 1); } } return bonnePosition; } /** * Vrifie que la nouvelle position n'est pas en prise avec une position dj prsente. * @param position la position de la nouvelle dame. * @return Si la position convient par rapport aux positions des autres dames. */ private static boolean verifierPrise(Point position) { boolean nonPrise = true; for (Point point : positions) { if (!point.equals(position)) { // Cas o sur la mme colonne. if (position.y == point.y) { nonPrise = false; } // Cas o sur mme diagonale. if (Math.abs(position.y - point.y) == Math.abs(position.x - point.x)) { nonPrise = false; } } } return nonPrise; }} #include <iostream>#include <list>#include <math.h>#include <stdlib.h>using namespace std;// Class to represent points.class Point { private: double xval, yval; public: // Constructor uses default arguments to allow calling with zero, one, // or two values.

How to look up range from set of ranges for given number," so simply put, this is what I am trying to do:I have a collection of Range objects that are contiguous (non overlapping, with no gaps between them), each containing a start and end int, and a reference to another object obj. These ranges are not of a fixed size (the first could be 1-49, the second 50-221, etc.). This collection could grow to be quite large.I am hoping to find a way to look up the range (or more specifically, the object that it references) that includes a given number without having to iterate over the entire collection checking each range to see if it includes the number. These lookups will be performed frequently, so speed/performance is key.Does anyone know of an algorithm/equation that might help me out here? I am writing in Java. I can provide more details if needed, but I figured I would try to keep it simple.Thanks. <code> ",How to look up range from set of contiguous ranges for given number
Is there a better explanation of stack map frames?," I've recently been looking at The Java Virtual Machine Specifications (JVMS) to try to better understand the what makes my programs work, but I've found a section that I'm not quite getting...Section 4.7.4 describes the StackMapTable Attribute, and in that section the document goes into details about stack map frames. The issue is that it's a little wordy and I learn best by example; not by reading.I understand that the first stack map frame is derived from the method descriptor, but I don't understand how (which is supposedly explained here.) Also, I don't entirely understand what the stack map frames do. I would assume they're similar to blocks in Java, but it appears as though you can't have stack map frames inside each other.Anyway, I have two specific questions:What do the stack map frames do?How is the first stack map frame created?and one general question:Can someone provide an explanation less wordy and easier to understand than the one given in the JVMS? <code> ",What is a stack map frame

How to prevent JavaFX application thread from dying with Swing interop," I'm embedding several JFXPanels into a Swing app and the JavaFX thread dies when the JFXPanels are no longer visible. This is problematic because creating another JFXPanel after the JavaFX thread dies will not start another JavaFX thread and thus the JFXPanel will be blank.From what I can tell the JFXPanel ctor starts the JavaFX thread by calling: Later on once the JFXPanel has a parent component its addNotify method is called which calls registerFinishListener which registers a PlatformImpl.FinishListener() with PlatformImpl. The act of registering the FinishListener prevents the JavaFX thread from dying when PlatformImpl.checkIdle() is called.When a JFXPanel is no longer visible its removeNotify method is call which calls deregisterFinishListener(): When instanceCount is zero the FinishListener is removed which causes PlatformImpl to call PlatformImpl.tkExit in the following code which causes the JavaFX thread to die: The only way I've found to fix this issue is to call Platform.setImplicitExit(false) at the begining of the Swing app so that the JavaFX thread never dies automatically. This fix requires a call the Platform.exit() when the application exits otherwise the JavaFX thread will prevent the process from stopping.This seems like a bug in JavaFX-Swing interop or at the very least the interop documentation should be modified to address this by discussing Platform.setImplicitExit(false).Another solution would be to allow creation of a new JavaFX thread when another JFXPanel is created but that is blocked by PlatformImpl.startup(Runnable): Am I missing something? <code>  PlatformImpl.startup(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { // No need to do anything here }}); private synchronized void deregisterFinishListener() { if (instanceCount.decrementAndGet() > 0) { // Other JFXPanels still alive return; } PlatformImpl.removeListener(finishListener); finishListener = null;} private static void notifyFinishListeners(boolean exitCalled) { // Notify listeners if any are registered, else exit directly if (listenersRegistered.get()) { for (FinishListener l : finishListeners) { if (exitCalled) { l.exitCalled(); } else { l.idle(implicitExit); } } } else if (implicitExit || platformExit.get()) { tkExit(); }} if (initialized.getAndSet(true)) { // If we've already initialized, just put the runnable on the queue. runLater(r); return;}",Prevent JavaFX thread from dying with JFXPanel Swing interop?

How does task cancellation work in RXJava?," I'm unclear on how to implement task cancellation in RXJava.I'm interested in porting an existing API built using Guava's ListenableFuture. My use case is as follows:I have an single operation that's composed of a sequence of futures joined by Futures.transform()Multiple subscribers observe the operation's final future.Each observer can cancel the final future, and all observers witness the cancellation event.Cancellation of the final future results in the cancellation of its dependencies, e.g. in sequence 1->2->3, cancellation of 3 is propagated to 2, and so on.There's very little info in the RxJava wiki about this; the only references I can find to cancellation mention Subscription as an equivalent to .NET's Disposable, but as far as I can see, Subscription only offers the ability to unsubscribe from subsequent values in the sequence.I'm unclear on how to implement ""any subscriber can cancel"" semantics through this API. Am I thinking about this in the wrong way? Any input would be appreciated. <code> ",How does task cancellation work in RxJava?

"Difference between @MapKey, @MapKeyColumn and @MapKeyJoinColumn in Hibernate"," As per Hibernate documentation, there are multiple annotations available if we want to use Map as an association between our entities. The doc says: Alternatively the map key is mapped to a dedicated column or columns. In order to customize the mapping use one of the following annotations: @MapKeyColumn if the map key is a basic type. If you don't specify the column name, the name of the property followed by underscore followed by KEY is used (for example orders_KEY). @MapKeyEnumerated / @MapKeyTemporal if the map key type is respectively an enum or a Date. @MapKeyJoinColumn/@MapKeyJoinColumns if the map key type is another entity. @AttributeOverride/@AttributeOverrides when the map key is a embeddable object. Use key. as a prefix for your embeddable object property names. You can also use @MapKeyClass to define the type of the key if you don't use generics.By doing some examples I am able to understand that @MapKey is just used to map the key to a property of target entity and this key is used only for fetching records. @MapKeyColumn is used to map the key to a property of target entity and this key is used to save as well as fetching records. Please let me know if this is correct?Also please let me know when I need to use @MapKeyJoinColumn/@MapKeyJoinColumns & @MapKeyEnumerated / @MapKeyTemporalThanks! <code> ","Difference between @MapKey, @MapKeyColumn and @MapKeyJoinColumn in JPA and Hibernate"

Why best practices vary for Static classes in C# and Java?," I'm currently reading about Java best practices and I found that according to this book we must Favor static classes over nonstatic. I've remembered that in C# best practices we must avoid such according to Coding Guidelines for C# 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 by Dennis Doomen: AV1008 - Avoid static classes With the exception of extension method containers static classes very often lead to badly designed code. They are also very difficult, if not impossible, to test in isolation unless youre willing to use some very hacky tools. Note If you really need that static class, mark it as static so that the compiler can prevent instance members and instantiating your class. This relieves you of creating an explicit private constructor.I found these two for C# answer and Java answer when to use and avoid static classes, but just by curiosity - both C# and Java are OOP languages, why it's this complete difference then in best practices?Update:I can't copy so much pages here from the Java book, but bottom line is: If you declare a member class that does not require access to an enclosing instance, always put the static modifier in its declaration, making it a static rather than a nonstatic member class. If you omit this modifier, each instance will have an extraneous reference to its enclosing instance. Storing this reference costs time and space, and can result in the enclosing instance being retained when it would otherwise be eligible for garbage collection (Item 6). And should you ever need to allocate an instance without an enclosing instance, youll be unable to do so, as nonstatic member class instances are required to have an enclosing instance. A common use of private static member classes is to represent components of the object represented by their enclosing class.So is it about performance only? Please note that this question is more about Static classes and OOP, not difeerences between Java and C#. <code> ",Why best practices vary for Static classes in OOP?

Is there a java look and feel based on flat design?," I have 5 java systems for engineering whose UI were developed using Swing.We started the development of these systems about 10 years ago and they have about 300K lines of code each. All these systems are in production environment.One question that bother us about the UI of these systems is that they look old when compared with large available UIs of cell phones, tablets and web sites.What do cell phones, tablets and web sites UI have in common ? Their look is based on the flat design concept.So, were starting a research to find low cost alternatives to give to our systems a modern look oriented to flat design.The first option we thought was to search a java L&F that is implemented based in the flat design concept. But We did not find one.Does anyone knows if there is a java look and feel based, specifically, on the flat design concept ?Best regards,Cludio. <code> ",Is there a java look and feel based on the flat design concept?

Calculate the date of Easter Sunday - java," Write a program to compute the date of Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon of spring.Use the algorithm invented by the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1800:Let y be the year (such as 1800 or 2001)Divide y by 19 and call the remainder a. Ignore the quotient.Divide y by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c.Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e.Divide 8 * b + 13 by 25 to get a quotient g. Ignore the remainder.Divide 19 * a + b - d - g + 15 by 30 to get a remainder h. Ignorethe quotient.Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a remainder k.Divide a + 11 * h by 319 to get a quotient m. Ignore the remainder.Divide 2 * e + 2 * j - k - h + m + 32 by 7 to get a remainder r. Ignore the quotient.Divide h - m + r + 90 by 25 to get a quotient n. Ignore theremainder.Divide h - m + r + n + 19 by 32 to get a remainder of p. Ignore thequotient.Then Easter falls on a day p of month n.For example, if y is 2001: Therefore, in 2001, Easter Sunday fell on April 15.

Also, make sure you output the values of p and n with the appropriate messages describing the values output.I'm having a little trouble putting this into Java code.

what determines ascending or descending order in Comparator / Comparable collection class," I understand we can sort or order the objects, stored in Collection as per our requirement(s).While I get deep understanding, I am not convinced by the fact that ascending and descending order of arrangement is achieved by (a - b) ->ascending or (b - a) -> descending where ""a"" and ""b"" are class members we chose to compare.Example: What is logic behind ordering object elements? how ""(this.grade - s.grade)"" if positive 1 moves ""this.grade"" front and puts ""s.grade"" next in order, why not other way around? Who validates the compare result (+1, -1, 0) and then puts in ascending order or descending order respectively, is there any documentation that describes internal working of this part? Please share, thank you much!Edit:I get the Java docs, my question is this: ""How does this happen?"" was my original question. I read the docs, still couldn't figure out. <code>  public int compareTo(Student s) { return this.grade - s.grade; //ascending order // return s.grade - this.grade; // descending order} public class Student implements Comparable <Student>{ String name; int grade; public Student(String name, int grade) { this.name = name; this.grade = grade; } public int compareTo(Student s) { return this.grade - s.grade; //ascending order // return s.grade - this.grade; // descending order } public String toString() { return this.name + "", "" + this.grade; }} sort these grades (13, 2)Case ascending -> return this.grade - s.grade;picture in my mind: compare (13, 2) , (13 - 2) > 0 so move 2 to front.result -> 2, 13------Case descending -> return s.grade - this.grade;picture in my mind: compare (2, 13) , (2 - 13) < 0 so move 13 to front.result -> 13, 2",What determines ascending or descending order in Comparator / Comparable collection class?
Is there a way to get a look and feel of windows 8 metro on java desktop applicaiton?," I am really struggling to find a good answer to this question, as stated in the Title. I am currently developing an application that will be desktop only with no CSS or any internet parts at all. I would like it to look like the metro look of Windows 8.

"How to use ""JSR-353: Java API for JSON Processing,"" without Method Chaining - *Answer Provided*"," I wanted to share my question/answer with using the new JSR-353 which is the Java API for JSON Processing. Specifically you can manipulate JSON data in 2 different ""API"" the Streaming and the Object API.If you type in ""jsr-353 tutorial"" into google you will get many results.https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353 ~ the details on the specific request.https://jsonp.java.net/ ~ main site for the API, also links you to the Oracle Tutorial under ""documentation"" located here https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/jsonp.htm I will talk more about this tutorial later.and finally this one http://www.javabeat.net/java-json-api-jsr-353/I want to talk about the last link first, as it's one which gave a lot of good detail for me to start, and one of the only real tutorials out there (there are others, but they are basically the same).What I really tried to learn about the API from being new to not only this API but JSON in general is.When To Use Streaming API and Object Model API?If you want the JSON data to be written to a character stream like a file or to a byte stream then the Streaming API will be the best choice as it directly perform the writing operation into the buffer without constructing the object tree in the memory i.e there is not intermediate form generated before the final JSON data is created.If you want to hold the JSON data as an object tree in the memory i.e not write to any stream but store the tree in the memory so that one can reuse the JSON data without need to reparse it or one can also serialize the object tree to persist/save the JSON data. Here the JSON data will be represented in the form of an object tree.Now the Streaming API description made a lot of sense to me and I needed to save a file so this made sense to me.As for the Object API it also made sense what it was doing, save the object so I can reuse it later in my code, awesome.The problem is that I didn't get an answer to my question, which I will explain what exactly I am looking for now.My Question is:I basically have 1 object that contains other objects/arrays.Originally I was using a BufferedWriter to writer the data to a new line into a text file.my format looks something like this. then finish up. Granted the numbers and such are placeholders and in reality everything from the write data, to the loop amounts are variable data I read from another file.As you can see I cannot use the traditional ""method-chaining"" that comes with JSR-353.As for what method chaining is, take a look at wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining. An example of Method Chaining using the Streaming API would be this, as shown in the above tutorial: I also looked at the Oracle Tutorial which confused me a bit where I saw ""Generating/Parsing"" as I was looking for a way to save files.https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/jsonp001.htm 19.1.3 Generating and Parsing JSON Data For generating and parsing JSON data, there are two programming models, which are similar to those used for XML documents. The streaming model uses an event-based parser that reads JSON data one element at a time. The parser generates events and stops for processing when an object or an array begins or ends, when it finds a key, or when it finds a value. Each element can be processed or discarded by the application code, and then the parser proceeds to the next event. This approach is adequate for local processing, in which the processing of an element does not require information from the rest of the data. The streaming model generates JSON output to a given stream by making a function call with one element at a time.The tutorial mentions this but it was confusing exactly what this mean, especially me thinking this was for writing and not reading. When it mentioned the last line (in bold) it didn't make much sense why it would do it one at a time, and made it seem that it only dealt with part of the object, not the whole, as the Object API mentions dealing with the entire tree.So instead of dealing with the Streaming API, I started with the Object API. I tried saving the file at first to a FileWriter, but nothing would be saved. Eventually I switched to a StringWriter and was using that in my project. I decided to switch back to the FileWriter after finishing up my structure and it somehow saved to the file, but I realize that part of my code was cut off at the end. I tried to do a tiny structure and it would print nothing.  <code>  bw.write(1);bw.newLine();bw.write(2);bw.newLine();for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){bw.write(i);bw.newLine();}bw.write(2);bw.newLine();for(int j = 0; j < 2; j++){bw.write(j);bw.newLine();bw.write(j+5);bw.newLine();bw.write(2);bw.newLine();bw.write(j*4);bw.newLine();}bw.write(12);bw.newLine();for(int k = 0; k < 82; k++){bw.write(k);bw.newLine();bw.write(k*5);bw.newLine();//do some additional code herebw.write(2);bw.newLine();bw.write(k*4);bw.newLine();} FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(""c:\\example.txt"");JsonGenerator gen = Json.createGenerator(writer);gen.writeStartObject() .write(""firstName"", ""Duke"") .write(""lastName"", ""Java"") .write(""age"", 18) .write(""street/Address"", ""100 Internet Dr"") .write(""city"", ""JavaTown"") .write(""state"", ""JA"") .write(""postalCode"", ""12345"") .writeStartArray(""phoneNumbers"") .writeStartObject() .write(""type"", ""mobile"") .write(""number"", ""111-111-1111"") .writeEnd() .writeStartObject() .write(""type"", ""home"") .write(""number"", ""222-222-2222"") .writeEnd() .writeEnd().writeEnd();gen.close();","How to use ""JSR-353: Java API for JSON Processing,"" without Method Chaining"

what is difference between read_committed and serializable isolation in oracle?," After reading few documents regarding transaction, I'm totally confused now. Let me first explain my scenario.I've a batch read which takes up around 3 minutes to read the data (SELECT) query from a table. And at the same time another thread tries to perform INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. It was throwing an error, saying ""could not acquire transaction"" (because my datasource had a default transaction of 8 (SERIALIZABLE)).To allow the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE to execute I set the transaction to READ_UNCOMMITTED (that no lock at all (read/write/range)). But when I executed my program it threw an error saying that the only supported transactions are READ_COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE.When I further investigated I found the Oracle has introduced transaction isolation type snapshot isolation which virtually eliminated repeatable reads and dirty reads by taking snapshot of the database during transaction, there by giving consistent data.From above statement I could use transaction type of READ_COMMITTED however Wikipedia totally confused my understanding till now with the below statement: Snapshot isolation is called ""serializable"" mode in Oracle[2][3][4] and PostgreSQL versions prior to 9.1,[5][6][7] which may cause confusion with the ""real serializability"" mode. There are arguments both for and against this decision; what is clear is that users must be aware of the distinction to avoid possible undesired anomalous behavior in their database system logic.So now my questions are: What is the difference between SERIALIZABLE and READ_COMMITTED from Oracle perspective?Does Oracle throw an error if snapshot isolation is taken and for two different transactions and updates same entry throw an error?Let me know if there are any breakaways from in my understanding. <code> ",What's the difference between READ_COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE isolation levels in Oracle database?

Please see the following code snippet - The use of freopen() in this way is very useful when we are trying to debug/test a small console application. We can put the sample input in 'input.txt' file once and reuse them every time instead of giving the input manually in terminal/console. And similarly we can print the output in 'output.txt' file.Now I am looking foreword a similar type of solution in java so that I can redirect input and output to text file. My target is to simplify the small console/program debugging while manipulating with some data. Providing these data to terminal/console recurrently as input is somewhat cumbersome. Can anyone suggest some good tips for doing this? <code>  int main(){ int n1, n2, result; freopen(""input.txt"", ""rb"", stdin); freopen(""output.txt"", ""wb"", sdtout); while(scanf(""%d %d"", &n1, &n2)==2 && n1>0 &&n2>0){ ... ... ... printf(""%d\n"", result); } return 0;}",Redirecting the stdout and stdin - Java

How to send Chinese characters in HTTPUrlConnection in Android?," I'm trying to pull an audio file from google's text-to-speech function. Basically, you toss in the link and then concat whatever you want to be spoken at the end of it. I've gotten the below code to work just fine for English, so I think the problem must be how the Chinese characters are getting encoded in the request. Here's what I've got: When I try this with Chinese characters, though, it returns something that I can't get to play in the mediaplayer (I suspect it's not a proper audio file as the vast majority of bytes are '85'). So I've tried both and and then adding to the request header. This just made it worse, though, because now it doesn't even return a 200 code, instead stating ""FileNotFound"" in logcat.So on a whim, I went back and tried the URL/Uri encoding with the English text, and now the English won't return a valid result either. Not sure what's going on here: the raw url in the debugger works fine if I copy and paste into Chrome, but for some reason the urlConnection just doesn't work. Feel like I'm missing something obvious.EDITFiddling with it some more has revealed no answer, just more confusion (and exasperation). For some reason, when sent over httpurlconnection, the Google tts machine reads the utf-8 percent-encoded text as utf-16, at least as far as I can tell. For example, the character """" (wei2) is %E7%B6%AD, but if you pass it through the connection, you'll get a file that pronounces ""see"" ("""", to be precise). , as it turns out, is 0x00E7 in UTF-16 (its utf-8 percent-encoded version is %C3%A7). I have no idea why it does that in Java, because putting the appropriate % at the end of the link in any browser will work properly. Thus far, I have tried various combinations of trying to get the tts to read the entirety of %E7%B6%AD without much success. EDIT2Solution to my problem found! See below for answer. The problem wasn't in the encoding, it was in the parsing on Google's end. Have edited the title accordingly.

Java 8 Optional orElse optional," I've been working with the new Optional type in Java 8, and I've come across what seems like a common operation that isn't supported functionally: an ""orElseOptional""Consider the following pattern: There are many forms of this pattern, but it boils down to wanting an ""orElse"" on an optional that takes a function producing a new optional, called only if the current one does not exist.It's implementation would look like this: I'm curious if there's a reason such a method doesn't exist, if I'm just using Optional in an unintended way, and what other ways people have come up with to deal with this case.I should say that I think that solutions involving custom utility classes/methods aren't elegant because people working with my code won't necessarily know they exist.Also, if anyone knows, will such a method be included in JDK 9, and where might I propose such a method?

Enum constant-specific class body," I have a enum type class: As you see above, I have defined one enum type which has value PLUS. It contains a constant-specific body. In its body, I tried to call printMe(val);, but I got the compilation error: Cannot make a static reference to the non-static method printMe().Why do I get this error? I mean I am overriding an abstract method in PLUS body. Why is it in static scope? How to get rid of it? I know adding a static keyword on printMe(){...} solves the problem, but I am interested to know if there is another way if I want to keep printMe() non-static?Another issue, quite similar as above one, but this time the error message sounds the other way around, i.e. PLUS(){...} has non-static context: I try to declare a PLUS-specific static variable, but I end up with error: the field ""name"" can not be declared static in a non-static inner type.Why can I not define static constant inside PLUS if PLUS is an anonymous class?

Java how to read folder and list files in that folder in jar enviroment instead of IDE," my problem is that I create a folder(name is IconResources) under src , in IconResources there are many pictures. Directory is like this:ProjectNamesrcpackage 1package 2IconResources(this is the target folder)I want to list all picture files name and do something with those pictures. And I found that File.list() only works in IDE, if I export project to a jar to make a standalone, it cannot work. So I searched and found that I should use inputstream and outputstream. Now I find i/o stream can works well for single file. But I want to use inputstream and outputstream to read folder(IconResource), then list the files in that folder. So my question is how to use i/o put stream to load a folder and iterate the folder to list file names in that folder. These things should work under not only IDE but also exported jar. My code are follows: above code only can run under IDE but break down in exported jar. <code>  private void initalizeIconFiles(File projectDirectory){ URL a = editor.getClass().getResource(""/IconResources/"");// Get Folder URL List<String> iconFileNames=new ArrayList<String>();//Create a list to store file names from IconResource Folder File iconFolder = new File(a.getFile()); Path path=Paths.get(iconFolder.getPath()); DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(path) ; for (Path entry : stream) { if (!Files.isDirectory(entry)) { System.out.println(entry.getFileName().toString()); iconFileNames.add(entry.getFileName().toString());// add file name in to name list } }}",Java how to read folder and list files in that folder in jar environment instead of IDE
why does hikariCP recommend fixed size pool for better performance," According to HikariCP's documentation they mentioned to create fixed size pool for better performance. minimumIdle: This property controls the minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP tries to maintain in the pool.If the idle connections dip below this value, HikariCP will make a best effort to add additional connections quickly and efficiently. However, for maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, we recommend not setting this value and instead allowing HikariCP to act as a fixed size connection pool. Default: same as maximumPoolSizeMy application usually requires 100 connections and only at a few circumstances reaches 200 connections.If I create a 200 connection fixed size pool, most of the time 100 connections will be idle.So which of the following is the best:Create connection pool with fixed size. i.e. 200 ORCreate connection pool by setting minimumIdle to 100 and maximumPoolSize to 200.Why the second point is not recommended by HikariCP? I think the second one would be the best for my case.  <code> ",Why does HikariCP recommend fixed size pool for better performance

What currency to use in unit tests," I'm developing an application that relies heavily on Joda-Money, and have a number of unit tests that verify my business logic. One (admittedly minor) sticking point for me has been what sort of Money/BigMoney objects to test with; specifically, what CurrencyUnit to use.As I see it, I have a couple of options:Just use USDThis is clearly the easiest way to go, and most of my actual application will be working with US Dollars so it makes a fair bit of sense. On the other hand, it feels rather US-centric, and I'm concerned it would risk letting currency-specific errors go unchecked.Use another real currency, like CADThis would catch erroneous hard-codings of USD, but otherwise isn't much better than just using USD.Use a dedicated ""fake"" currency, i.e. XTSThis clearly makes sense, after all, XTS is ""reserved for use in testing"". But Joda denotes psuedo-currencies as currencies with -1 decimal places. In practice, the primary difference between currencies in Joda-Money is the number of decimal places, so this risks masking any errors involving decimal place precision, such as erroneously rounding to an integer value.Register my own custom currency with CurrencyUnit.registerCurrency()This would obviously work, but seems a little odd seeing as there are alternatives.Use a CurrencyUnit instance created by a mocking libraryPretty much the same as registering a custom currency.Again, this is obviously a minor issue, but I'm curious if there's a standard practice for cases like this, or if there's a clear reason to prefer one of these options in particular. <code> ",What currency to use in unit tests?

should I strictly avoid using enums on Android?," I used to define a set of related constants like Bundle keys together in an interface like below: This provides me a nicer way to group related constants together and used them by making a static import (not implements).

From this question ""Avoid Enums Where You Only Need Ints removed from Android's performance tips? it's clear that Google has removed ""Avoid enums"" from its performance tips, but from it's official training docs Be aware of memory overhead section it clearly says: ""Enums often require more than twice as much memory as static constants. You should strictly avoid using enums on Android."" Is this still holds good?

How do I write generic Java method to find maximum of an array?," I have written the following code: The problem is in this line: if(array[i] > max). I understand that Java can't understand the > operator in case of unknown/arbitrary classes. At the same time, I don't want to write different methods for the objects of the classes that I know I'll be sending. Is there a workaround? <code>  private static <T> T getMax(T[] array) { if(array.length == 0) { return null; } T max = array[0]; for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) { if (array[i] > max) max = array[i]; } return max; }",How do I write generic Java method and compare two variables of the generic type inside the method?

Why does the Collections.shuffle() algorithm work better than others in shuffling a Collection?," Collections.shuffle() goes through each index of a Collection backwards and then swaps it with a random index including or before it. I was wondering why, so I tried doing the same thing but swapping with any random index in the Collection.Here is the shuffling part of the Collections.shuffle() code: And here is my algorithm: I found that Collections.shuffle() was much more evenly distributed than my code when I ran both on the same ArrayList one million times. Also, when running my code on: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]it seems that the following permutations consistently occur most frequently: [1, 0, 3, 4, 2] [1, 2, 3, 4, 0] [1, 2, 0, 4, 3] [0, 2, 3, 4, 1] [1, 2, 3, 0, 4]Could someone please explain why? <code>  for (int i=size; i>1; i--) swap(arr, i-1, rnd.nextInt(i)); Random r = new Random();for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) { int index = r.nextInt(a.size()); int temp = a.get(i); a.set(i, a.get(index)); a.set(index, temp);}",Why does the Collections.shuffle() algorithm work better than my implementation

Jaxb ignore namespace," I use Jaxb2 and Spring. I am trying to unmarshal some XML that are sent by 2 of my customers. Up to now, I only had to handle one customer which sent some xml like this : that is bound to a POJO like this : I discovered that the previous developer hardcoded the namespace in the unmarshaller in order to make it work.Now, the second customer sends the same XML but changes the namespace! Obviously, the unmarshaller fails to unmarshall because it expects some {com.acme}foo instead of {com.xyz}foo. Unforunately, asking the customer to change the XML is not an option.What I tried : 1) In application-context.xml, I searched for a configuration which would allow me to ignore the namespace but could not find one : it seems that the only available options are the ones listed in the Jaxb2Marshaller's Javadoc : 2) I also tried to configure the unmarshaller in the code : 3) Different form with a SAXParser : This one works!

How can I use Amazon S3 and Cloudfront more intelligently for caching webapges," I have a website (running within Tomcat on Elastic Beanstalk) that generates artist discographies (a single page for one artist). This can be resource intensive, so as the artist pages don't change over a month period I put a CloudFront Distribution in front of it. I thought this would mean no artist request ever had to be served more than once by my server however its not quite as good as that. This post explains that every edge location (Europe, US etc.) will get a miss the first time they look up the resource and that there is a limit to how many resources are kept in the cloudfront cache so they could be dropped.So to counter this I have changed by server code to store a copy of the webpage in a bucket within S3 AND to check this first when a request comes in, so if the artist page already exists in S3 then the server retrieves it and returns its contents as the webpage. This greatly reduces the processing as it only constructs a webpage for a particular artist once. However:The request still has to go to the server to check if the artist page exists.If the artist page exists then the webpage (and they can sometimes be large up-to 20mb) is first downloaded to the server and then server returns the page.So I wanted to know if I could improve this - I know you can construct an S3 bucket as a redirect to another website. Is there a per-page way I could get the artist request to go to the S3 bucket and then have it return the page if it exists or call server if it does not?Alternatively could I get the server to check if page exists and then redirect to the S3 page rather than download the page to the server first? <code> ",Use Amazon S3 and Cloudfront for intelligently caching webapges

Java: Array of methods: Adapter Pattern?," Problem Description:I want to be able to pass around a list of methods to other classes where the methods have been defined in only one class. If the methods, some of which have input parameters and non-void return types, are defined in one class, I want to be able to pass a list of some of them, with possible duplicates, as a parameter to some other class's constructor. Code Description:The code below is a crude example and can be ignored if it detracts from the main goal. Another example, in addition to the one below, would be a case where the methods are int Add(int n1, int n2), int Subtract(int n1, int n2), Multiply, etc.. and the interface has a method called int MathOperation(int n1, int n2). Attempt to solve the problem:The adapter pattern seems to have the functionality I'm looking for but I have only seen examples where the methods in the interface have no input or output parameters. An example implementation I wrote just for this question is posted below.Problem Analogy:You have a random picture generator web service. There are 30 mutations that can be applied to an image. The client connects and clicks a ""generate"" button and a random list of some of those functions are passed to some other class within the web service which then proceeds to run those functions with it's own data while also collecting and possibly re-using the return values to generate some mutated cat image. It can't just explicitly call the methods in the other class because that process needs to be done randomly at run-time. That is why I lean towards the idea of generating a random list of methods which are executed in-order when the 'generate' button is clicked.I hope I have been clear. <code>  public class SomeClass { ... public double UseWrench(double torque, boolean clockwise) { ... } public double UsePliers(double torque, boolean clockwise) { ... } public double UseScrewDriver(double torque, boolean clockwise) { ... } public boolean UseWireCutters(double torque) { ... } interface IToolActions { double TurnFastener(double torque, boolean clockwise); boolean CutWire(double torque); } private IToolActions[] toolActions = new IToolActions[] { new IToolActions() { public double TurnFastener(double torque, boolean clockwise) { double UseWrench(double torque, boolean clockwise); } }, new IToolActions() { public double TurnFastener(double torque, boolean clockwise) { double UsePliers(double torque, boolean clockwise); } }, new IToolActions() { public double TurnFastener(double torque, boolean clockwise) { double UseScrewDriver(double torque, boolean clockwise); } }, new IToolActions() { public boolean CutWire(double torque) { boolean UseWireCutters(double torque); } }, };}public class Worker<T> { public List<? extends IToolActions> toolActions; public Worker(List<? extends IToolActions> initialToolSet){ toolActions = initialToolActions; }}",Array of methods: Adapter Pattern?

Java Final Value Setting," This is probably a dumb question, but I'll risk asking it anyway.Often I need to create a final variable for use somewhere else and the value of that variable will need to be set based on some condition. This is how I typically do it: I can then use the variable finalVersion where I need to. But, this just seems somehow wrong. Is there a better way to do this?Edit: By ""better"", I meant that I was looking for a method for defining the final variable that did not require that I create an extra variable. I knew that creating an extra variable was inefficient and not a good practice, and I was positive that there must be a way of doing what needed to be done without the extra steps.I received an answer, which I have marked as accepted. As I stated in my comment, I had originally tried the solution provided, but received an error from Eclipse. I must have either typed it incorrectly the first time, or Eclipse has something of a ""hiccup"".I accept that there are many ways of doing something and that what one person will accept as the best way is not what someone else would consider. However, all of the answers included here, were clear and to the point and, I feel, solved my problem. <code>  String notFinalVersion = null;if (someThing == 1) { notFinalVersion = ""The value was 1."";} else { notFinalVersion = ""The value is not 1."";}final String finalVersion = notFinalVersion;",Java use of non-final variable to set final variable

Java : setting object to null within a method has no effect," I am trying to write a method to delete a Node from a Binary Search Tree. Here is my method to delete a node. I checked this method on a leaf node, though after debugging I discovered that the execution of nodeToBeSelected=null takes place, the node isn't actually deleted.

declaring variable outside for loop in Java," Can someone please enlighten me on the following matter: In the for-loop, we declare counterOne outside the loop and use it inside the loop.

How to create my own android library, I'm working on creating a log-in screen to be used with multiple different android applications. What would be the best way to package it so that other people could use my log-in function on their apps. It would be preferred that it would auto-sync for them in-case we were to make changes.***EDIT****It seems packaging it into a library module is the best option. How does one go about uploading this module so that if we make an update to this module it will seamlessly update without having to pull from github for example. Thanks! <code> ,How to create my own android library and host it

Can I access the same variable from different threads in C++?," In Java, sometimes when accessing the same variable from different threads, each thread will create its own copy of the variable, and so if I set the value of the variable in one thread to 10 and then I tried to read the value of this variable from another thread, I will not get 10 (because the second thread is reading from another copy of the variable!).To fix this problem in Java, all I had to do is to use the keyword volatile, for example: Does this problem also exists in C++? If so, how can I fix it?Note: I am using Visual C++ 2010. <code>  volatile int i = 123;",Is there an equivalent of Java 'volatile' in C++?

Gradle project with Spring Hibernate and LIquibase," I'm currently working on a Spring project which uses Hibernate and Liquibase. What I am trying to achieve is to update Liquibase's changelog automatically every time I build the project. It's supposed to generate a diff based on my current productive database and my updated Hibernate Entities.But the problem I have is that every time I clean and rebuild my project I get the following error: As far as I understand it the problem is that Liquibase requires all the entity classes to be loaded into gradle's classpath, but since the Java classes are just being compiled or have not been compiled that is not the case yet, hence the error message.I can fix this error by building the project in two steps:First I execute the task compileJava to build the entity classes. Once that is done I can perform a normal build - now without any problems.However building the project in two steps is quite tedious. Is there a way I can work around this issue to build it in just one step?My build.gradle currently looks like this: <code>  liquibase-plugin: Running the 'main' activity...INFO 6/22/15 11:12 AM:

Merging a managed entity using EntityManager along with CascadeType.MERGE," Given below a one-to-many relationship from Department to Employee.Department (parent) : Employee (child) : Merging a managed entity (child) like the following (using CMT in EJB), does not update the corresponding employee row in the database table. It happens only when CascadeType.MERGE is removed from the child @ManyToOne relationship in Employee.Why doesn't the row in the table get updated? What is the sole purpose of CascadeType.MERGE regarding this example?I am currently using EclipseLink 2.6.0 having JPA 2.1. <code>  @OneToMany(mappedBy = ""department"", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)private List<Employee> employeeList = new ArrayList<Employee>(0); @JoinColumn(name = ""department_id"", referencedColumnName = ""department_id"")@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE, CascadeType.REFRESH, CascadeType.DETACH})private Department department; Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1L);employee.setDepartment(department); // department is supplied by a client.employee.setEmployeeName(""xyz"");entityManager.merge(employee);",Merging a managed entity on the @ManyToOne side
How is this done in Java Obfuscation?," Today I came across an obfuscated class (well a lot of obfuscated classes in a jar) and I do not have a clue on how this kind of obfuscation is done.An example: As you see above, all the parameter variables are a snow-man. How can this be undone? Also how is it done in the first place; how is the JVM able to ""process"" those and execute the code without any problem?To clarify, I am not going to use this code, it is just for educational purposes. I am taking the Computer Science course at school so since we are learning Java and talking of limitations such as decompilations. I am interested in learning more, so I decided to have a look into bigger projects especially servers. This piece of code is pulled out of the Spigot server for Minecraft (A game) that is a fork of Bukkit server for Minecraft that was supposed to be open source. <code>  protected void a(ChannelHandlerContext , ByteBuf , ByteBuf ) throws Exception { int = .readableBytes(); if ( < this.c) { .b(0); .writeBytes(); } else { byte[] = new byte[]; .readBytes(); .b(.length); this.b.setInput(, 0, ); this.b.finish(); while (!this.b.finished()) { int = this.b.deflate(this.a); .writeBytes(this.a, 0, ); } this.b.reset(); } }}",How is obfuscation done in Java?

"Best practises for using interfaces in code, but hiding internal methods from end user"," Review the following model: ContextImpl uses BeanFactory interface, that's why method destroyBeans() is placed there. But I don't want it to be there, because it is internal API and should be hidden from user.I thought of using AbstractBeanFactory reference with protected destroyBeans() method inside Context. That will solve the problem of exposing method to end user, but will replace the interface with abstract class.Another variant is to make another interface, that will extend end-user interface, and use it inside Context. This will break the ability for user to create his own BeanFactory implentations.I wanted to know if there is a well-known solution for the problem or just see another alternatives. <code>  interface Context { BeanFactory getBeanFactory(); // public method void refresh(); // public method void destroy(); // public method}interface BeanFactory { <T> T getBean(String id); // public method void destroyBeans(); // should be private method for user, but visible for Context}class ContextImpl implements Context { private BeanFactory beanFactory; @Override public void destroy() { beanFactory.destroyBeans(); }}","Best practices for using interfaces in code, but hiding internal methods from end user"

How to create custom junit4 assertions that don't show in the Failure Trace, I'd like to add some custom assertions to our code base that properly hide from the failure trace.

I know how to reuse old assertions or throw a new AssertionError.What I can't figure out how to do is keep the new custom assertions out of the Failure Trace.

"How to concatenate all map key-values into a string, using streams, & with replacements made on each value?"," I'm a Java 7 person, and have been commanded to never use a for-loop again, with only partial tongue in cheek. I need to take a Map<String, String>, and end up with a string of command-line parameters, as in the output of the following code (ignoring the ""streamy"" line for the moment): The names/keys remain unchanged. The values need to be placed in double quotes, and all existing double quotes need to be escaped (\""). The close-quotes should be followed by a space.I've done it the pre-java-8 way in forLoop, and partially with streams in resetAllValues, which actually alters each entry. The streamy one is way wrong, as it's repeatedly appending all current output onto the next element...How can this be done efficiently with streams? And how can it be done in a way that doesn't alter the map entries or use a builder? I'm not seeing it yet. Continued...

Session update and partial Transaction Rollback," I am using a stateless EJB class to update a persistence entity located in a database. A method within the EJB calls an implementation class where the work is done. I believe what is causing the issue is that an entity called Foo, has a oneToMany relationship with an entity Bar. Things are done, and the Session is updated with Foo which 'cascades' to Bar. When a StaleObjectStateException occurs, the transaction is not being fully rolled back which is causing errors for obvious reasons. EJB: Implementation: Relevant Foo code: So basically, when the Transaction tries to rollback, the Bar parts that were changed get rolled back, but the new Bar (bar2 in code) records remain..Any guidance would be appreciated. Like I said I believe the error here has to do with the sess.update(foo); possibly something to do with autocommit, but by default it should be off.I believe that what is happening, is that the Session.Update(foo) is in turn creating two separate transactions. Specifically, the Foo is updated (SQL UPDATE), but the Bar is saved (SQL INSERT). Since the transaction context would only really see the SQL UPDATE, that is all it reverses.

Basic unit test for Spark Streaming," I've been trying to track down an issue with some unit/integration tests I've been writing for an Apache Spark project.When using Spark 1.1.1 my test passed. When I tried to upgrade to 1.4.0 (also tried 1.4.1) the test starts failing.I've managed to reduce the code needed to reproduce the issue down to the small integration test below. Interestingly, if I comment out the @RunWith annotation on the test then the test passes correctly. Obviously I don't need the @RunWith annotation for this cut down test, but the real tests make use of mocks fairly extensively, so I'd rather not have to drop using PowerMock.

How to build a docker container for a java app," What I want to do is build a docker image for my Java application but the following considerations should be true for most compiled languages.problemOn my build server I want to produce a docker image for my application as the deliverable. For this I have to compile the application using some build tool (typically Gradle, Maven or Ant) and then add the created JAR file to the docker image. As I want the docker image to just execute the JAR file I will of course start from a base image with Java already installed.There are three ways of doing this:let the build tool control the processIn this case my build tool controls the whole process. So it prepares the JAR file and after the JAR is created it calls Docker to create the image. This works as the JAR is created beforehand and Docker can be oblivious of the build process needed to create the JAR.But my Dockerfile is no longer standalone. It depends on steps to happen outside of Docker for it work. In my Dockerfile I will have a COPY or ADD statement that is supposed to copy the JAR file to the image. This statement will fail when the jar is not created beforehand. So just executing the Dockerfile might not work. This becomes a problem if you want to integrate with services that just build using the present Dockerfile like the auto-build feature on DockerHub.let Docker control the buildIn this case all necessary steps to create the image are added to the Dockerfile so the image can be created by just executing the Docker build.The main problem with this approach is that there is no way to add to a Dockerfile commands that should be executed outside the docker image being created. This means I have to add my source code and my build tools to the docker image and build my JAR file inside the image. This will result in my image being bigger than it has to be due to all the files added that will be unnecessary at runtime. This will also add extra layers to my image.Edit:As @adrian-mouat pointed out if I would add the sources, build the application and deleted the sources in one RUN statement I could avoid adding unnecessary files and layers to the Docker image. This would mean creating some insane chained command.two separate buildsIn this case we split our build in two: first we create the JAR file using our build tool and upload it to a repository (Maven or Ivy repository). We then trigger a separate Docker build that just adds the JAR file from the repository.conclusionIn my opinion the better way would be letting the build tool control the process. This is will result in a clean docker image and as the image is what we want to deliver this is of importance. To avoid having a potentially not working Dockerfile lying around this should be created as part of the build. So no one would accidentally use it to start a broken build.But this will not allow me to integrate with DockerHub.questionIs there another way I am missing?update June 2020In the years since I first created this question a lot of stuff has changed. At this point I would advocate using Googel's JIB Tool. It integrates with the most common Java Build Tools (Maven and Gradle) and allows you to create container directly from your build. This is much more concise than any of the old approaches I considered all these years ago.update February 2021I found this blog post and video from James Ward that reflects better what is currently state of the art.https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/comparing-containerization-methods-buildpacks-jib-and-dockerfile <code> ",How to build a docker container for a Java application

How to unit test a void method with no arguments," I need to test a class to determine if a relevant action has taken place given a certain input.

How does all annotations are working in java without main()," I have a doubt in TestNG with Java. I am completly new to TestNG. My doubt is, How all the test cases are executing using TestNG in java without having main() method? Please suggest me if you have any ideas. Following code is the example of a sample test case using TestNG in java. But if you notice, you can find one thing that there is no main() method in the code. Then, how does the testcases are executing? I have another doubt. Is main() method needed for selenium Webdriver and TestNG combination to execute a script? Or can we execute testcases without main() method? If we can execute testcases without main(), then how does it is possible? <code>  package com.first.example;import org.testng.annotations.Test;public class demoOne { @Test public void firstTestCase() { System.out.println(""im in first test case from demoOne Class""); } @Test public void secondTestCase() { System.out.println(""im in second test case from demoOne Class""); }}",How does all annotations work in TestNg without main() method
Installing a java service on Windows 7 with NSSM," I am trying to use Inno Setup to install a Windows service as a JAR file running under NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) ends up putting my service in the ""Paused"" state, and it doesn't ever seem to get started.Since the location of java.exe can change with updates, I want to be able to run the service without having the explicit path to java.exe, how can I launch the java service without an explicit path in NSSM? <code>  nssm install JarService java -jar service.jarnssm start JarService",Installing a Java service on Windows 7 with NSSM
CollapsingToolbarLayout doesnt recognize scroll fling," I have created a simple CollapsingToolbarLayout and it works like a charm. My problem is, that if I try to use a fling scroll on the nestedscrollview, it just stops when I release my finger. Normal scrolling works like it should.My activities code is unchanged => auto generated empty activity. (I just clicked on create new empty activity in android studio and edited the XML yet).I read here, that scroll gestures on the imageview itself are buggy, but not, that the scrolling itself is buggy: see here.I tried activating ""smooth scrolling"" through java code. It seems like if I scroll far enough that the imageview isn't visible anymore, fling gestures then are recognized. TLDR: Why does the fling gesture not work as long as the imageview is visible ?My XML Code looks like this: <code>  <android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"" xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"" android:layout_width=""match_parent"" android:layout_height=""match_parent"" android:fitsSystemWindows=""true""> <android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout android:id=""@+id/profile_app_bar_layout"" android:layout_width=""match_parent"" android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" android:theme=""@style/ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBar"" android:fitsSystemWindows=""true""> <android.support.design.widget.CollapsingToolbarLayout android:id=""@+id/profile_collapsing_toolbar_layout"" android:layout_width=""match_parent"" android:layout_height=""match_parent"" app:layout_scrollFlags=""scroll|exitUntilCollapsed"" app:contentScrim=""?attr/colorPrimary"" app:expandedTitleMarginStart=""48dp"" app:expandedTitleMarginEnd=""64dp"" android:fitsSystemWindows=""true""> <ImageView android:id=""@+id/image"" android:layout_width=""match_parent"" android:layout_height=""420dp"" android:scaleType=""centerCrop"" android:fitsSystemWindows=""true"" android:src=""@drawable/headerbg"" android:maxHeight=""192dp"" app:layout_collapseMode=""parallax""/> <android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar android:id=""@+id/toolbar"" android:layout_width=""match_parent"" android:layout_height=""?attr/actionBarSize"" app:popupTheme=""@style/ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Light"" app:layout_collapseMode=""pin"" /> </android.support.design.widget.CollapsingToolbarLayout> </android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout> <android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton android:id=""@+id/fab"" app:layout_anchor=""@id/profile_app_bar_layout"" app:layout_anchorGravity=""bottom|right|end"" android:layout_height=""@dimen/fab_size_normal"" android:layout_width=""@dimen/fab_size_normal"" app:elevation=""2dp"" app:pressedTranslationZ=""12dp"" android:layout_marginRight=""8dp"" android:layout_marginEnd=""8dp""/> <android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView android:id=""@+id/profile_content_scroll"" android:layout_width=""match_parent"" android:layout_height=""match_parent"" android:clipToPadding=""false"" app:layout_behavior=""@string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior"" android:layout_gravity=""fill_vertical"" android:minHeight=""192dp"" android:overScrollMode=""ifContentScrolls"" > <RelativeLayout android:layout_width=""match_parent"" android:layout_height=""wrap_content""> <TextView android:layout_width=""match_parent"" android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" android:text=""@string/LoremIpsum""/> </RelativeLayout> </android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView></android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout>",CollapsingToolbarLayout doesn't recognize scroll fling

"Android Studio complains that my class must implement abstract method X, when it does"," I have this abstract superclass: and the concrete subclass: At the first line of the VideoListActivity subclass, Android Studio gives the error Class 'VideoListActivity' must either be declared abstract or implement abstract method 'launchMedia(MediaFile)' in 'MediaListActivity'I can see why it should. But it does! Doesn't it? I've checked that the signature matches; I've tried Option+Return to get the IDE to suggest fixes; nothing works.Is this just a mistake on Android Studio's part? or am I doing something wrong?Now it happens that the classes are in different packages: the subclass VideoListActivity is in a ""sub-package,"" foo.bar.baz.video, whereas the superclass MediaListActivity is in package foo.bar.baz.If I move VideoListActivity up into foo.bar.baz package, the error goes away.

I've familiarized myself with this multicatch explaination article.Consider these two exceptions and code: I won't be able to call getCustomValue(), even though the method is the same, because inside Java the above try/catch is supposed to actually be casting the MyException1/2 to Exception (that's how I understood the docs).However, if I introduce an interface like this: and add it to both exceptions, Java is actually able to allow me to use that method. And then calling this is valid: In short, my question is: what is actually happening here: (MyException1|MyException2 e). What is e?Is the closest superclass chosen as the type of e? This question asks about it and that's, supposedly, the answer. If so, then why is the interface CustomValueGetter ""visible"" when I access e? It shouldn't be if, in my case, e is an Exception. And if not, if the real class is either MyException1 or MyException2 why am I not simply able to call the same method available for both of those classes?Is e an instance of a dynamically generated class which implements all common interfaces of both exceptions and is of the nearest common supperclass type? <code>  public class MyException1 extends Exception { // constructors, etc String getCustomValue();}public class MyException2 extends Exception { // constructors, etc String getCustomValue() { return ""foo""; }}try { //...} catch (MyException1|MyException2 e) { e.getCustomValue(); // won't work, as I expected} public interface CustomValueGetter { String getCustomValue();}public class MyException1 extends Exception implements CustomValueGetter /*...*/public class MyException2 extends Exception implements CustomValueGetter /*...*/ try { //...} catch (MyException1|MyException2 e) { e.getCustomValue(); // does work}",Determining compile-time multicatch exception type
"In Java, why a protected member can be accessed from outside the class within the same package?"," In his book, Herbert Schildt says in page 172 (3rd paragraph) that ""protected applies only when inheritance is involved."".In page 228, Table 9-1 shows that a protected member can be accessed from a non-sub class within the same package.The following code works and supports the information in Table 9-1.Class1.java: Class2.java Class3.java It is alright that the variable pro can be accessed from the derived class Class2. But how can it be accessed from the non-derived class Class3 through a reference to an object of Class1? It contradicts the statement on page 172. If it is so, then I find no difference between the public and protected specifiers in this situation. <code>  package Mypack;public class Class1{ protected pro=1; public Class1() { System.out.println(pro); }} package Mypack;class Class2 extends Class1{ Class2() { System.out.println(pro); }} package Mypack;class Class3{ Class3() { Class1 class1=new Class1(); System.out.println(class1.pro); }}","In Java, why can a protected member be accessed from outside the class within the same package?"

Difficult condition to understand on Java Specification.," while reading on reference type casting in Java's SE specification: Given a compile-time reference type S (source) and a compile-time reference type T (target), a casting conversion exists from S to T if no compile-time errors occur due to the following rules.I keep finding the following kind of condition: If S is a class type: If T is a class type, then either |S| <: |T|, or |T| <: |S|. Otherwise, a compile-time error occurs. Furthermore, if there exists a supertype X of T, and a supertype Y of S, such that both X and Y are provably distinct parameterized types (4.5), and that the erasures of X and Y are the same, a compile-time error occurs.Can anybody give me an example of this situation?EDIT:For further clarification of the article I'm citing refer to section 5.5.1 on this link <code> ",Difficult condition to understand on Java Specification

how unreferred values from string pool get remove?," I'm curious how values from a string-pool get removed? suppose: In case of GC, ""ABC"" from the heap gets collected but ""ABC"" is still in the pool (because its in permGen and GC would not affect it). If we keep adding values like: What I want to know is: Will the pool remove values that are not referred to? If not, it means that the pool is eating up unnecessary memory. What is the point then because the JVM is using the pool?

Write a recursive method called power that takes a double x and an integer n and that returns x^n," I need to write a recursive method using Java called power that takes a double x and an integer n and that returns x^n. Here is what I have so far. This code works as expected. However, I am trying to go the extra mile and perform the following optional exercise: ""Optional challenge: you can make this method more efficient, when n is even, using x^n = (x^(n/2))^2.""I am not sure how to implement that last formula when n is even. I do not think I can use recursion for that. I have tried to implement the following, but it also does not work because I cannot take a double to the power of an int. Can somebody point me in the right direction? I feel like I am missing something obvious. All help appreciated. <code>  public static double power(double x, int n) { if (n == 0) return 1; if (n == 1) return x; else return x * (power(x, n-1));} if (n%2 == 0) return (x^(n/2))^2;",Recursive method for x^n optimised for when n is even

Question: How do I resolve this ""Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added:"" , why does app:preDexDebug think there is multiple version of my classes or tries to add multiple versions???Thanks a million to all! <code>  E/AndroidRuntime(17749): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to instantiate application com.xyz.sample.QuickSampleApplication: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class ""com.xyz.sample.QuickSampleApplication"" on path: DexPathList[[zip file""/data/app/com.uei.sample.library-2.apk""],nativeLibraryDirectories=[/data/app-lib/com.uei.sample.library-2, /vendor/lib, /system/lib]] dependencies { provided project(':quicksdklibrary') //OR provided fileTree(dir: 'libs/MyExternalLibs', include: '*.jar') compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.0'} <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?><manifest xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"" package=""com.xyz.sample.library"" android:versionCode=""1"" android:versionName=""1.0.002""> <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=""19"" /> <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.INTERNET"" /> <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"" /> <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"" /> <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE""/> <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE""/> <application android:icon=""@drawable/icon"" android:label=""@string/app_name"" android:name=""com.xyz.sample.QuickSampleApplication""> <activity android:name=""com.xyz.sample.QuickSampleActivity"" android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" android:label=""@string/app_name"" android:launchMode=""singleTask""> <intent-filter> <action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" /> <category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"" /> </intent-filter> </activity> </application></manifest> compile fileTree(dir: 'src/main/java', include: ['*']) compile fileTree(dir: 'src/main/java/com/xyz', include: ['*']) compile fileTree(dir: 'src/main/java/com/xyz', include: ['*.java']) compile fileTree(dir: 'src/main/java', include: ['*.java']) compile file(libs/quicksdklibrary.jar) sourceSets { main{ java { java.srcDirs 'src/main/java' } } } sourceSets { main{ java { java.srcDirs 'src/main/java/com/xyz' } } } dependencies { compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1' provided project(':quicksdklibrary')} dependencies { compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar']) // OR compile files(libs/:quicksdklibrary.jar) // OR compile project(':quicksdklibrary') compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1'} Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/xyz/ace/ACEUtils$Creator;Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/xyz/ace/AEUtils;Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/xyz/ace/AEngine;Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/xyz/ace/ATag;Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/xyz/ace/ABehavior;Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/xyz/ace/AContext;Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/xyz/ace/AControl$List;Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/xyz/ace/AControl;Uncaught translation error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/xyz/ace/AData;UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION:Error:Execution failed for task ':app:preDexDebug'.com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_79\bin\java.exe'' finished with non-zero exit value 2","Android, ClassNotFoundException when using ""provided project "" OR IllegalArgumentException: already added , when using ""compile project"""
Spring Data JPA Specification using CriteriaBuilder w/ a one to many relationship," I have a User entity, a UserToApplication entity, and an Application entity.A single User can have access to more than one Application.

I have the following Specification that I use to search for a User by firstNm, lastNm, and email. And here is the User_ metamodel that I have so far.

Scoping Programming Practices," Given the following methods: 1) Is the only difference in the above methods readability or is there a micro-optimization ""benefit"" in methodTwo()?2) Should the defining of local variables in a narrow scope be shunned and avoided when possible? (I can see methodTwo becoming unreadable if several calculations must be performed in a single statement) <code>  public int methodOne() { int total = local_int_one + local_int_two; return total;}public int methodTwo() { return local_int_one + local_int_two;}",Local variables: Programming Practices
Listview crashes in portait mode when clicked on items (using fragments)," I am using fragment layout in my app, this app contains a listview. Clicking on items will do some job. works fine when in landscape mode but getting crashed if items are clicked when in portait mode. What can be the problem?Here is my code:MainAcitivity.java MenuFragment.java // showing the list view TextFragment.java // for the actions upon clicking the items AndroidManifest.xml Logcat ActivityMain.xml ActivityMain.xml of landscpae ListFragment.xml // for the listview TextFragment.xml Screenshots Current situation of the portait mode after following the suggestions suggested in the answers:UPDATEI am able to overcome the crashing problem and to move to next screen after clicking on items from the listview while in portait mode currently, but the view is returning null there; means the contents which I want to be displayed there (blue part of the screenshot) is not displaying, the screen is blank.Here is the updated code:MenuFragment.java //////////////updated code

how to setup an HTTPS server for JAVA application," I am using java to create a desktop application, and this application uses an API. To secure the communication with the API, I was informed by their support to use HTTPS. Please guide me on how to setup a https connection from a java client.The API has this function which states that it can choose a secure connection: this code gives me the idea that ""request"" will be my current url or server, so it will be me on my side that will setup the https connection. Clockworksms API Wrapper: <code>  private String getUrlAddress(XmlRequest request) { // determine if this is a secure connection String url = this.ssl ?

Datastax Cassandra - Inheritance when using object mapper," I try using Cassandra for persisting quite simple POJOs, but using a class hierarchy (many subclasses, one superclass). I am using Java and the Datastax driver (and the object mapper).My problem is that the Object Mapper doesn't seem to recognize fields annotated in superclasses.The structure I implemented is: I then try to save Subclass objects: This throws: Is there any way to get it running in a structure like this? One solution was to redeclare the userId / deviceID field in the subclass, but this would be quite ugly (much repetitive code). Any ideas how to archive a good structure or best practices for a case like this? <code>  @Table(keyspace = ""..."", name = ""..."")public class Subclass extends Superclass { public double x; public double y; public double z; ....}public class Superclass { @PartitionKey(0) @Column(name = ""user_id"") public long userId; @PartitionKey(1) @Column(name = ""device_id"") public long deviceId;} public static void main(String[] args) { Subclass data = new Subclass(); data.deviceId = 123; data.userId = 1212; data.x = 0; data.y = 1; data.z = 2; Cluster cluster; Session session; ...

How to use interceptor to add Headers in Retrofit 2.0," Our team decide to adopt Retrofit 2.0 and I'm doing some initial research on it. I'm a newbie to this library.I'm wondering how to use interceptor to add customized headers via Retrofits 2.0 in our Android app. There are many tutorials about using interceptor to add headers in Retrofit 1.X, but since the APIs have changed a lot in the latest version, I'm not sure how to adapt those methods in the new version. Also, Retrofit hasn't update its new documentation yet.For example, in the following codes, how should I implement the Interceptor class to add extra headers? Besides, what exactly is the undocumented Chain object? When will the intercept() be called? <code>  OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient(); client.interceptors().add(new Interceptor() { @Override public Response intercept(Chain chain) throws IOException { Response response = chain.proceed(chain.request()); // How to add extra headers? return response; } }); Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder() .baseUrl(BASE_API_URL) .client(client) .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create()) .build();",How to use interceptor to add Headers in Retrofit 2.0?

looking for API similar to firstNonNull in Java," I'm sorry for the title but I cant find a good way to describe the problem in one sentence. In short, I have a lot of Java code following this pattern which can be rewritten as It's still ugly and I'm wondering if there is some API in Google Guava or other library to help clean up this code. Specifically, I'm looking for something like I can implement this method using reflection but I'm not sure if that's the proper way to do it. Thanks. <code>  if (obj != null && obj.getPropertyX() != null) { return obj.getPropertyX();}return defaultProperty; return obj != null && obj.getPropertyX() != null ? obj.getPropertyX() : defaultProperty; return someAPI(obj, ""getPropertyX"", defaultProperty);",How do you simulate a null safe operator with a default return value?
Flink Streaming: How to output one data stream to different outputs depending on the data?," In Apache Flink I have a stream of tuples. Let's assume a really simple Tuple1<String>. The tuple can have an arbitrary value in it's value field (e.g. 'P1', 'P2', etc.). The set of possible values is finite but I don't know the full set beforehand (so there could be a 'P362'). I want to write that tuple to a certain output location depending on the value inside of the tuple. So e.g. I would like to have the following file structure:/output/P1/output/P2In the documentation I only found possibilities to write to locations that I know beforehand (e.g. stream.writeCsv(""/output/somewhere"")), but no way of letting the contents of the data decide where the data is actually ending up.I read about output splitting in the documentation but this doesn't seem to provide a way to redirect the output to different destinations the way I would like to have it (or I just don't understand how this would work).Can this be done with the Flink API, if so, how? If not, is there maybe a third party library that can do it or would I have to build such a thing on my own? <code> ",How to output one data stream to different outputs depending on the data?

JPA: How do I avoid loading an object simply so I can store it's ID in the database?," This question is so simple, you can probably just read the codeThis is a very simple performance question. In the code example below, I wish to set the Owner on my Cat object. I have the ownerId, but the cats method for requires an Owner object, not a Long. Eg: setOwner(Owner owner) I'm using the ownerId to load an Owner object, so I can call the setter on the Cat which is simply going to pull out the id, and save the Cat record with an owner_id. So essentially I'm loading an owner for nothing.What is the correct pattern for this? <code>  @Autowired OwnerRepository ownerRepository;@Autowired CatRepository catRepository;Long ownerId = 21;Cat cat = new Cat(""Jake"");cat.setOwner(ownerRepository.findById(ownerId)); // What a waste of timecatRepository.save(cat)",JPA: How do I avoid loading an object simply so I can store its ID in the database?

It allows us to write: and it doesn't look very safe as stringObj.length() return us an integer that is one more than what the last index is.Is it made intentionally and does this have a purpose?

Maybe the stop condition is not appropriate or the logic itself (my thought is to try and reuse the ObjectNode and ArrayNode objects on the next call, to ""insert"" the ""children"" element (from the json) on the next child node on the tree, so it would be built backwards, but in the end I get null variables ).My tree and node classes are based on the following : http://sujitpal.blogspot.com.br/2006/05/java-data-structure-generic-tree.html <code>  Tree<String> tree = new Tree<String>(); Node<String> rootNode = new Node<String>(""root""); Node<String> nodeA = new Node<String>(""A""); Node<String> nodeB = new Node<String>(""B""); Node<String> nodeC = new Node<String>(""C""); Node<String> nodeD = new Node<String>(""D""); Node<String> nodeE = new Node<String>(""E""); rootNode.addChild(nodeA); rootNode.addChild(nodeB); nodeA.addChild(nodeC); nodeB.addChild(nodeD); nodeB.addChild(nodeE); tree.setRootElement(rootNode); {text: ""root"", children: [{text:""A"", children:[{text:""C"", children: []}]}, {text:""B"", children: [{text: ""D"", children: []}, {text:""E"", children:[]}]}] } public String generateJSONfromTree(Tree<String> tree) throws IOException{ String json = """"; ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(); JsonFactory factory = new JsonFactory(); ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); // buffer to write to string later JsonGenerator generator = factory.createJsonGenerator(out, JsonEncoding.UTF8); JsonNode rootNode = mapper.createObjectNode(); JsonNode coreNode = mapper.createObjectNode(); JsonNode dataNode = (ArrayNode)generateJSON(tree.getRootElement()); // the tree nodes // assembly arrays and objects ((ObjectNode)coreNode).put(""data"", dataNode); ((ObjectNode)rootNode).put(""core"", coreNode); mapper.writeTree(generator, rootNode); json = out.toString(); return json;} public ArrayNode generateJSON(Node<String> node, ObjectNode obN, ArrayNode arrN){ // stop condition ? if(node.getChildren().isEmpty()){ arrN.add(obN); return arrN; } obN.put(""text"", node.getData()); for (Node<String> child : node.getChildren()){ // recursively call on child nodes passing the current object node obN.put(""children"", generateJSON(child, obN, arrN)); }}",Recursively building a JSON string to jsTree with Jackson

How is type <T> resolved in this method?," Preface: I understand generics and how they're declared at the class level (e.g. class MyClass<T>) but I've never seen it declared at the level of a static method, and without any explicit bindings (e.g. class MySubclass<String> extends MyClass).I found this code snippet in an app I'm working on (I didn't write this part). I've never seen a method declared this way. <T> is not defined anywhere else in the class. Intent.getExtras().get() returns an Object which may actually be a String, Boolean ...etc. Sample usage: How does the JVM know what type to use for <T>? (Yes this method compiles and executes successfully). <code>  private static <T> T getItemExtra(final Intent intent, final String extraName) { T item = null; if(intent != null && intent.getExtras() != null) { item = (T) intent.getExtras().get(extraName); } return item;} String s1 = getItemExtra(someIntent, ""some_string_extra"");Uri u1 = getItemExtra(someIntent, ""some_uri_extra"");",What is a generic method and how is <T> bound in this case?

Android - custom button with shape drawables and a gradiant programmatically," I want to make a custom button like this program does with perhaps a radial gradient. I subclassed view, and draw three shape drawables and then draw the text. the text seems off center, so I tried to draw a bounding rectangle for the text, but no luck there. and was planning on adding a click listener to get button like behaviour.perhaps I should subclass button, but where to draw my drawables so they don't get messed up by the button's text being drawn.Any pointers will be appreciated.thanksEdit2: see second attempt below.Edit3: the reason for the bounty is to figure out why subclassing drawable does not work. the gradient is not so important.edit4: discovered drawRect before getTextBounds() in DrawableView::OnDraw(). This version tries to subclass drawable and use a button. but the button's drawing seems to interfere with drawing my drawable shapes. it looks like the bounds are being ignored. <code>  package acme.drawables;import android.content.*;import android.content.pm.*;import android.graphics.*;import android.graphics.drawable.*;import android.graphics.drawable.shapes.*;import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;import android.os.Bundle;import android.util.*;import android.view.Menu;import android.view.View;import android.widget.*;import static java.lang.Math.*;public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { DrawableView drawableView;

Heroku: Spring Boot Gradle app with https tomcat server," I have a Spring Boot java app that uses a self-signed certificate to communicate with the android front-end.I use a tomcat server as my container for the app: Now, I have enabled https / ssl: I have to enable SSL as I want my android frontend to communicate to my server securely. I use the technique called certificate pinning which means I add the same self-signed certificate to both my server and my android app. For any http communications between the two, the communication will be encrypted with the keys of the same certificate and hence the server and android app will be able to understand one another.When I load it into Heroku, I get errors each time I try to call the server: According to this blog by Julie: http://juliekrueger.com/blog/ As a side note, Heroku apps are https enabled by default. The server I was installing had Tomcat configured to use https, and trying to access an endpoint was returning a code=H13 desc=""Connection closed without response"" error. After I removed that configuration the error went away.I can fix the error by just removing the ssl / https from my tomcat server, but as I mentioned, I want to use the certificate pinning technique for secure communications.I was thinking whether it was possible to disable the SSL on heroku side but keep my tomcat server SSL active but I already contacted Heroku and they told me that disabling the piggyback SSL that comes standard with their service is not possible.I also looked at the paid alternative here called SSL Endpoint but it seems only userful for custom domains. Since all endpoints are coded within my android app and is not visible to the user, it makes no sense for me to use a custom domain. Furthermore, I don't think it will solve my problem as its sole objective seems to be to create the custom domain: SSL Endpoint is only useful for custom domains. All default appname.herokuapp.com domains are already SSL-enabled and can be accessed by using https, for example, https://appname.herokuapp.com.I googled for a few days now and cannot seem to come up with a solution. Disabling ssl on my tomcat side would not be acceptable in my mind as it poses too much risks. I would even consider other services (Azure etc) if this would solve my problem.Any ideas on how I can solve this? <code>  compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-tomcat' TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory tomcat = (TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory) container; tomcat.addConnectorCustomizers(connector -> { connector.setPort(Integer.parseInt(serverPort)); connector.setSecure(true); connector.setScheme(""https""); 2015-12-11T20:04:32.424629+00:00 heroku[router]: at=error code=H13 desc=""Connection closed without response"" method=GET path=""/getfood?postid=566348364a918a12046ce96f"" host=app.herokuapp.com request_id=bf975c13-69f3-45f5-9e04-ca6817b6c410 fwd=""197.89.172.181"" dyno=web.1 connect=0ms service=4ms status=503 bytes=0",Heroku: Spring Boot Gradle app with https tomcat server and certificate pinning

Java concurrency and synchronization," I'm really a new at Java concurrency and I'm trying to implement the following specifications:We have a car park which has some park spotsEach car is represented as a thread which endlessy change the car state from Driving - Parking. Each car has his own parking spot.When the car is in the parking state, it tries to park in a spot (no necessary his spot). If the spot is free then it parks else it will skip this parking phase and go back to drive.The car remains in the spot unless the owner of the spot want to park.This is not the exact specification, but the only problem that I have is the following:I'm not able to make the car skip the turn. If two cars pick the same spots, then one is parked and the other is waiting until the park is free. Which is not the bahvior that I want.My first idea was to simply synchronize the read and write to a variable occupied: If I run this with three cars, then I will end up in having car0 is parking at spot1, car1 is parking at spot0, car2 is waiting on spot0, because car1 is executing the synchronized block park(Car c). I don't get how is it possible that two cars can park in the same spot if the willingToPark is synchronized.Thank you <code>  class Car implements Runnable { private CarState state = CarState.driving run { while(true) { switch(state) { case driving: System.out.println(this + "" driving.""); state = parking; break; case parking: Spot s = CarPark.getRandomSpot(); if(s.willingToPark(this)) { System.out.println(s + "" occupied. "" + this + "" skip park turn.""); } else { s.park(this); } state = driving; } } }}class Spot { private boolean occupied = false; private Car owner = new Car(...); synchronized boolean willingToPark(Car c) { if(occupied) { return true; } else { occupied = true; return false; } synchronized void park(Car c) { System.out.println(c + "" parking at "" + this); //don't care how this is implemented, just keep in mind //that it will enter in a loop until the owner came back. occupied = false; }}","How can two threads be ""in"" a ""synchronized"" method"
SSL Config w StompBrokerRelayRegistration / ActiveMQ / Undertow," I'm attempting to build a websocket messaging app based on the Spring Websocket Demo running ActiveMQ as the STOMP message broker with Undertow. The application runs fine on insecure connections. However, I'm having difficulty configuring the STOMP Broker Relay to forward with SSL connections. As mentioned in the Spring WebSocket Docs... The ""STOMP broker relay"" in the above configuration is a Spring MessageHandler that handles messages by forwarding them to an external message broker. To do so it establishes TCP connections to the broker, forwards all messages to it, and then forwards all messages received from the broker to clients through their WebSocket sessions. Essentially it acts as a ""relay"" that forwards messages in both directions.Further, the docs state a dependency on reactor-net which I have... Please add a dependency on org.projectreactor:reactor-net for TCP connection management.The issue is that my current implementation doesn't initialize the NettyTCPClient via SSL so the ActiveMQ connection fails with an SSLException. As such I've attempted to research the Project Reactor Docs to set SSL options for the connection but I haven't been successful. At this point I've found the StompBrokerRelayMessageHandler initializes the NettyTCPClient by default in Reactor2TcpClient yet, it doesn't appear to configurable.Assistance would be greatly appreciated.SSCCE app.props WebSocketConfig SOLVED Per Rossens Advice.

Spring Boot SSL TCPClient ~ StompBrokerRelayRegistration ~ ActiveMQ ~ Undertow," I'm attempting to build a websocket messaging app based on the Spring Websocket Demo running ActiveMQ as the STOMP message broker with Undertow. The application runs fine on insecure connections. However, I'm having difficulty configuring the STOMP Broker Relay to forward with SSL connections. As mentioned in the Spring WebSocket Docs... The ""STOMP broker relay"" in the above configuration is a Spring MessageHandler that handles messages by forwarding them to an external message broker. To do so it establishes TCP connections to the broker, forwards all messages to it, and then forwards all messages received from the broker to clients through their WebSocket sessions. Essentially it acts as a ""relay"" that forwards messages in both directions.Further, the docs state a dependency on reactor-net which I have... Please add a dependency on org.projectreactor:reactor-net for TCP connection management.The issue is that my current implementation doesn't initialize the NettyTCPClient via SSL so the ActiveMQ connection fails with an SSLException. As such I've attempted to research the Project Reactor Docs to set SSL options for the connection but I haven't been successful.

How can I use the java compiler to warn if an annotated method is referenced?," Let's say I define a custom annotation called @Unsafe.I'd like to provide an annotation processor which will detect references to methods annotated with @Unsafe and print a warning. For example, given this code ... ... I want the compiler to print something like: It is very similar in spirit to @Deprecated, but my annotation is communicating something different, so I can't use @Deprecated directly. Is there a way to achieve this with an annotation processor? The annotation processor API seems to be more focused on the entities applying the annotations (Foo.java in my example) than entities which reference annotated members.This question provides a technique to achieve it as a separate build step using ASM. But I'm wondering if I can do it in a more natural way with javac & annotation processing? <code>  public class Foo { @Unsafe public void doSomething() { ... }}public class Bar { public static void main(String[] args) { new Foo().doSomething(); }} WARN > Bar.java, line 3 : Call to Unsafe API - Foo.doSomething()",Make the java compiler warn when an annotated method is used (like @deprecated)

Where are the definitions for the ant tasks in netbeans?," I've got a netbeans project, and I've got groovy in it as well for spock testing. When I right-click on the project and say test, it runs a task called but when I run ant test-with-groovy the tests are compiled but not run. I feel like something must be added by the netbeans ide but I have no idea what and half a day of searching has netted no results.Can anyone help me?Here is how you can get the results I am getting:I created a simple java project with a simple main in netbeans 8.0.2 then I created two test files, one a junit java file: and one a groovy based spock test: if I run the tests from netbeans, the output says it is running: but if I run that in the ant command line it doesn't run any tests (though it gives no errors either) It does compile both test files into class files in build/test/classes.If I run ant clean test it builds both test files but does not run the groovy test, only the java test.the build-impl.xml has the definitions for test (I won't include the whole file, but it is the standard one created by netbeans: here are the relevant sections I believe: ... and the test-with-groovy ant target is in the included groovy-build.xml: I must confess I don't know what the macrodefs are really doing.

zero length multidimensional array, I know that similar questions have been asked several times and they were nicely answered but... they were about zero length array of 1 dimension like: Seems that there is a purpose for such arrays in case when null should not / cannot be used. But why Java allows to create things like that: Of course like in simple 1D case we get nothing from such array if we try to iterate or something and I am asking only because it looks extremely nasty for me. :-)How much memory is allocated for such a pointless creature? <code>  int[] array = new int[0]; int[][][] multiDims = new int[5][0][9];,Zero length multidimensional array

Can guava cache my asynchronous GWT results?," In my GWT Application I'm often refering several times to the same server results. I also don't know which code is executed first.

Parsing a XML keeping duplicated namespaces in the parent node and child node," Before I start: I know that the child node inherits the namespace from the parent node and that's why my problem occurs. Unfortunately, the webservice I am sending my XML doesn't accept the child node without the namespace and, as it is a government entity, a change in their part is rather unlikely.That being said, I am using Spring-WS to make the communication between my application and the webservice, so in one way or the other the framework uses a transformer to parse my payload Source to the framework's payload Result: Before that transformation take place, my XML has these two nodes like it follows here: After the transformation, the second namespace is removed(as I said before, I know the reason): I am also aware that I can use marshallers to achieve the same result and writing the parse code myself. Using that approach is also ok and would be acceptable, but I don't know any other way to achieve the same thing (transforming the javax.xml.transform.Source into javax.xml.transform.Result) using other approach besides the one listed above.I have two questions then:1 - Can I avoid the behaviour I am having with the default approach(without using marshallers)?2 - Is there any other tool that would make the same transformation? <code>  transformer.transform(Source, Result); <enviNFe xmlns=""http://www.portalfiscal.inf.br/nfe"" versao=""3.10""> <NFe xmlns=""http://www.portalfiscal.inf.br/nfe""> <enviNFe xmlns=""http://www.portalfiscal.inf.br/nfe"" versao=""3.10""> <NFe>",Parsing a XML not keeping duplicated namespaces in the parent node and child node
Apache POI much quicker using XSSF than HSSF - what next?," I've been having some issues with parsing .xlsx files with Apache POI - I am getting java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space in my deployed app. I'm only processing files under 5MB and around 70,000 rows so my suspicion from reading number other questions is that something is amiss.As suggested in this comment I decided to run SSPerformanceTest.java with the suggested variables so see if there is anything wrong with my code or setup. The results show a significant difference between HSSF (.xls) and XSSF (.xlsx):1) HSSF 50000 50 1: Elapsed 1 seconds2) SXSSF 50000 50 1: Elapsed 5 seconds3) XSSF 50000 50 1: Elapsed 15 secondsThe FAQ specifically says: If you can't run that with 50,000 rows and 50 columns in all of HSSF, XSSF and SXSSF in under 3 seconds (ideally a lot less!), the problem is with your environment.Next, it says to run XLS2CSV.java which I have done. Feeding in the XSSF file generated above (with 50000 rows and 50 columns) takes around 15 seconds - the same amount it took to write the file.Is something wrong with my environment, and if so how do I investigate further?Stats from VisualVM show the heap used shooting up to 1.2Gb during the processing. Surely this is way too high considering that's an extra gig on top of the heap compared to before processing began?Note: The heap space exception mentioned above only happens in production (on Google App Engine) and only for .xlsx files, however the tests mentioned in this question have all been run on my development machine with -Xmx2g. I'm hoping that if I can fix the problem on my development setup it will use less memory when I deploy.Stack trace from app engine: Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at org.apache.xmlbeans.impl.store.Cur.createElementXobj(Cur.java:260) at org.apache.xmlbeans.impl.store.Cur$CurLoadContext.startElement(Cur.java:2997) at org.apache.xmlbeans.impl.store.Locale$SaxHandler.startElement(Locale.java:3211) at org.apache.xmlbeans.impl.piccolo.xml.Piccolo.reportStartTag(Piccolo.java:1082) at org.apache.xmlbeans.impl.piccolo.xml.PiccoloLexer.parseAttributesNS(PiccoloLexer.java:1802) at org.apache.xmlbeans.impl.piccolo.xml.PiccoloLexer.parseOpenTagNS(PiccoloLexer.java:1521) <code> ",Apache POI much quicker using HSSF than XSSF - what next?
Bootstrap (actually JQuery) DatePicker does not hide on blur in modal," I have a wicket bootstrap DateTextField on a panel inside modal. When datepicker is shown from click, datepicker is attached to the root page, not the modal.That causes a problem: without adding some z-index to datepicker, I cannot see it on top of modal.When I blur from the picker, it should close. Somehow, due the fact the picker is not child of modal, clicking outside datepicker closes it only, if it is clicked outside the modal. Inside modal nothing happens.I can tweak this by autoclose, but when you go to input and manually use backSpace to clear the value, there is no a way to close datepicker by clicking somewhere inside the modal.Some html to make it clear: How to get datepicker attached to modal, or somehow else fix the issue of blur inside the modal? I have tried to attach the panel a click event that hides datepicker, but it hides the datepicker right away when it opens.Edit:Click to modal does nothing, although html is moved artificially there and is placed correctly in DOM tree. Thanks to @Gavriel about insight to moving stuff between DOM elements, though.Edit2:Code to reproduce situation: As you see from snippet, java code generates the jQuery part.Edit3:I speak about this creature:[DateTextField sources] https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap/blob/master/bootstrap-extensions/src/main/java/de/agilecoders/wicket/extensions/markup/html/bootstrap/form/DateTextField.javaEdit4:Hmm.. I added in Javascript a blur event listener inside the input in modal and that blur even did not work. So it turns out that the real question in hand is how to get onblur work inside modal. Because that is what is broken!! Edit5:Sorry, cannot give fiddle. From Edit3 you see sources I use for picker and what I really call is this function: which is inside java class, so not JavaScript at all although syntax is looking so similar. For my understanding fiddles take no java code inside them. Wicket needs the java part, I am sorry about it.For fiddle askers I found similar situation on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/VytfY/227/ - works 100% ok, similar technologies I mention here, no use to my problem.Last edit: Thanks @Mathew you made my day, above is what it ended to be. I added to input element a class datepickerContainer so clicking it does not hide picker.Thanks folks, this is done!One more: for IE, use: instead of direct remove. Remove not yet supported, even IE11. <code>  <html> <panel> <modal> <input>datefield is here</input> </modal> <panel> <datepicker comes here> </html> class MyPanel extends Panel { DateTextField field = new DateTextField(""foo""); (...) add(field); }class MyPage extends WebPage { (...)

Implemented ComboBox where list gets filtered by input. It has a small issue," I've implemented a ComboBox where its list is filtered by the input in the ComboBox TextField. It works as you might expect a filter of such a control to work. Every item in the list that starts with the input text is shown in the list.I just have one small issue. If I select an item from the list, and then try to remove the last character in the textfield, nothing happens. If I select an item from the list, and then try to remove any other character than the last, the whole string gets removed. Both of these problems occur only if this is the first thing I do in the ComboBox. If I write something in the combo box first, or if I select an item for the second time, none of the issues described occurs.What's really strange to me is that these problems seem to be caused by the predicate being set (if I comment out the invoking of setPredicate, everything works fine). This is strange since I think that should only affect the list that the predicate is being set for. It shouldn't affect the rest of the ComboBox. Edit: I've tried to override the key listeners in a desperate attempt to solve the issue: Sadly, this doesn't fix the issue either. If I e.g. choose the ""Three is a number"" item and then try to remove the last ""e"" in ""Three"", this is the values that the text property will switch between: So it removes the correct character at first, but then it removes the whole String for some reason. As mentioned before, this happens only because the predicate has been set, and it only happens when I do the first input after I've selected an item for the first time. <code>  import javafx.application.Application;import javafx.beans.value.ChangeListener;import javafx.beans.value.ObservableValue;import javafx.collections.FXCollections;import javafx.collections.ObservableList;import javafx.collections.transformation.FilteredList;import javafx.scene.Scene;import javafx.scene.control.ComboBox;import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;import javafx.stage.Stage;import javafx.util.StringConverter;public class TestInputFilter extends Application { public void start(Stage stage) { VBox root = new VBox(); ComboBox<ComboBoxItem> cb = new ComboBox<ComboBoxItem>(); cb.setEditable(true); cb.setConverter(new StringConverter<ComboBoxItem>() { @Override // To convert the ComboBoxItem to a String we just call its // toString() method. public String toString(ComboBoxItem object) { return object == null ? null : object.toString(); } @Override // To convert the String to a ComboBoxItem we loop through all of // the items in the combobox dropdown and select anyone that starts // with the String.

Under which circumstances can .stream().collect(Collectors.toList()) return an empty list when invoked on a non empty list?," After detecting a flaw in one of my web services I tracked down the error to the following one-liner: This line was returning false when I positively knew that the list of domains contained a domain which name was equal to the provided name. So after scratching my head for a while, I ended up splitting the whole line to see what was going on. I got the following in my debugging session:Please notice the following line: According to the debugger, domains is a list with two elements. But after applying .stream().collect(Collectors.toList()) I get a completely empty list. Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I understand, that should be the identity operation and return the same list (or a copy of it if we are strict). So what is going on here??? Before you ask: No, I haven't manipulated that screenshot at all.To put this in context, this code is executed in a stateful request scoped EJB using JPA managed entities with field access in a extended persistence context. Here you have some parts of the code relevant to the problem at hand: I've included both getVersions and getDomains methods because I have similar operations running flawlessly on versions. The only significant difference I'm able to find is that versions are eagerly fetched while domains are lazily fetched. But as far as I know the code is being executed inside a transaction and the list of domains is being loaded. If not I'd get a lazy initialization exception, wouldn't I?UPDATE: Following @Ferrybig 's suggestion I've investigated the issue a bit further, and there doesn't seem to have anything to do with improper lazy loading. If I traverse the collection in a classic way I still can't get proper results using streams: So it seems that even when the collection has been loaded you still have that odd behavior. This seems to be a missing or empty spliterator implementation in the proxy used to manage lazy collections. What do you think?BTW, this is deployed on Glassfish / EclipseLink <code>  return this.getTemplate().getDomains().stream().anyMatch(domain -> domain.getName().equals(name)); List<Domain> domains2 = domains.stream().collect(Collectors.toList()); @Stateful@RequestScoped@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)public class DomainResources { @PersistenceContext(type = PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED) @RequestScoped private EntityManager entityManager; public boolean templateContainsDomainWithName(String name) { // Extra code included to diagnose the problem MetadataTemplate template = this.getTemplate(); List<Domain> domains = template.getDomains(); List<Domain> domains2 = domains.stream().collect(Collectors.toList()); List<String> names = domains.stream().map(Domain::getName).collect(Collectors.toList()); boolean exists1 = names.contains(name); boolean exists2 = this.getTemplate().getDomains().stream().anyMatch(domain -> domain.getName().equals(name)); return this.getTemplate().getDomains().stream().anyMatch(domain -> domain.getName().equals(name)); } @POST @RolesAllowed({""root""}) public Response createDomain(@Valid @EmptyID DomainDTO domainDTO, @Context UriInfo uriInfo) { if (this.getTemplate().getLastVersionState() != State.DRAFT) { throw new UnmodifiableTemplateException(); } else if (templateContainsDomainWithName(domainDTO.name)) { throw new DuplicatedKeyException(""name"", domainDTO.name); } else { Domain domain = this.getTemplate().createNewDomain(domainDTO.name); this.entityManager.flush(); return Response.created(uriInfo.getAbsolutePathBuilder().path(domain.getId()).build()).entity(new DomainDTO(domain)).type(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).build(); } }}@Entitypublic class MetadataTemplate extends IdentifiedObject { @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER, mappedBy = ""metadataTemplate"", orphanRemoval = true) @OrderBy(value = ""creationDate"") private List<Version> versions = new LinkedList<>(); @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY, orphanRemoval = true) @OrderBy(value = ""name"") private List<Domain> domains = new LinkedList<>(); public List<Version> getVersions() { return Collections.unmodifiableList(versions); } public List<Domain> getDomains() { return Collections.unmodifiableList(domains); }} boolean found = false;for (Domain domain: this.getTemplate().getDomains()) { if (domain.getName().equals(name)) { found = true; }}List<Domain> domains = this.getTemplate().getDomains();long estimatedSize = domains.spliterator().estimateSize(); // This returns 0!domains.spliterator().forEachRemaining(domain -> { // Execution flow never reaches this point!});",Stream API not working for lazy loaded collections in EclipseLink / Glassfish?

Are there any uses of java finalize method?," Everything that I have read about the java finalize method says NOT to use it. It seems that it is almost never guaranteed to be called and may present problems even when it is.There are a few other questions that ask when to use it, and it seems the general consensus is NEVER.I have never used it myself (mainly because of the warnings not to), and I haven't seen it used anywhere.Are there any cases at all where it would be appropriate? Are there cases where there is no alternative? If not, why is it there? Are there internal classes that do use it and require the method to be available? Or is it just something that shouldn't be there?I'm not so much interested in when I should use it (which has been answered with ""never""), but clarification on why it is even there given that answer of ""never"". If it is so useless and dangerous, why hasn't it been depreciated and removed? <code> ",Is there any need for java's finalize method?

Taylor Series Using JDK 8 Lambdas," I threw together a quick Java implementation of a Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, because it was easy and fun: I'm ashamed to admit that my employer is still using JDK 6 and JDK 7; I'm not writing on JDK 8 during my work day yet. I have not groked all new features in the JDK, including lambdas.I warmed up by writing a Taylor series expansion for pi using lambda. It's easy and elegant. Surprisingly, it requires a million terms to converge to six digits of accuracy, but that's the nature of the series.I decided to try and implement the exponential function using a lambda. I don't want to do the naive thing and use the Math.pow or factorial functions; the implementation I posted without lambdas accomplishes both nicely. I can't see how to have each step in the lambda remember what the value of the previous term was. Can anyone help a lambda beginner and give an example? <code>  package math.series;import java.util.stream.IntStream;/** * Created by Michael * Creation date 3/6/2016. * @link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35826081/calculating-ex-in-c-sharp * @link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80 */public class TaylorSeries { public static final int DEFAULT_NUM_TERMS = 10; public static void main(String[] args) { int n = (args.length > 0) ?

Spring boot devtools - Static content reloading does not work," When building my first Spring Boot app, I discovered that I need to restart my app every time I make a change to a Javascript file in /resources/static/some-file.jsThis is very time consuming.When I move the files to the /webapps/ folder, it works as expected, but the files are not packaged in a JAR. The docs mention this, so I cannot continue this way.I read all about spring-boot-devtools, and have installed it in my POM, but the hotswapping doesn't seam to be working. I still need to restart the entire app to see a Javascript or CSS file change.When the app starts, I can see the line LiveReload server is running on port 35729, so spring-boot-devtools must be doing something...What would be the steps to further investigate what is going wrong?My guess is that when IntelliJ runs the app, the files are copied, so when I make a change, I'm actually changing the original files and not the ones used by the running app.PS: I'm using Maven, IntelliJ IDEA 15 and Spring Boot 1.3.3 with the embedded Tomcat server. I'm not sure what command IntelliJ runs to start the app. The IDE is handling this ""automatically"". Perhaps I need to change my run configuration? <code> ",Spring boot devtools - Static content reloading does not work in IntelliJ

Overriding equals() outside the class," Is it possible to override Object#equals(Object) locally when using list.contains(someObject)?Example: But what if I want another kind of equals when I use list.contains(someObject)? For example I want to know if a list contains a certain name? Is it possible to override Object#equals(Object) 'anonymously'?More specific explanation why I would need it: Now I have List<SomeObject> someObjects and I would like to know if this list contains an object with objectId without necessarily iterating over it.One ""solution"" I could think of would be using Map<Integer, SomeObject> mapping and then someObject = mapping.get(objectId)EDIT: My question is not a duplicate since I am specifically asking to override Object#equals(Object). <code>  class SomeObject { ... private int id; private String name; @Overrdide public boolean equals(Object other){ ... return this.id == other.id; }} int objectId = ... // Some event which passes me the attribute of an object but not the object itself",Overriding Object#equals(Object) outside the class
Java Async is blocking ?," After doing lots of searching on Java, I really am very confused over the following questions: Why would I choose an asynchronous method over a multi-threaded method? Java futures are supposed to be non-blocking. What does non-blocking mean? Why call it non-blocking when the method to extract information from a Future--i.e., get()--is blocking and will simply halt the entire thread till the method is done processing? Perhaps a callback method that rings the church bell of completion when processing is complete? How do I make a method async? What is the method signature? How would this fictional method become a non blocking method? Or if you want please provide a simple synchronous method and an asynchronous method version of it.  <code>  public List<T> databaseQuery(String Query, String[] args){ String preparedQuery = QueryBaker(Query, args); List<int> listOfNumbers = DB_Exec(preparedQuery); // time taking task return listOfNumbers;}",Java Async is blocking?
Java do-while() loop difficulties," I've been writing a program that will take an array of the names of music files and play them. I succeeded in doing that, but, I wanted to touch up on some things and make it a little nicer. I am trying to make the music play in a random order but not repeat any songs before the entire list has been played. I was almost able to do it but I think there is something wrong with my do-while loop. The program runs as intended for about eight songs but then it stops playing the music and the JVM continues to run. I am using BlueJ as I am still an AP Comp Sci student so I realize that I might not be able to accomplish this task but any help would be greatly appreciated.

I did, find that BlueJ programs don't open the terminal window (the thing that comes up when you do a ""System.out.print()"") if you ask for input before you have any output but I don't think that comes into account for this program.

Is it important to use Characteristics.UNORDERED when possible?," Since I use streams a great deal, some of them dealing with a large amount of data, I thought it would be a good idea to pre-allocate my collection-based collectors with an approximate size to prevent expensive reallocation as the collection grows. So I came up with this, and similar ones for other collection types: Used like this My concern is that the implementation of Collectors.toSet() sets a Characteristics enum that Collectors.toCollection() does not: Characteristics.UNORDERED. There is no convenient variation of Collectors.toCollection() to set the desired characteristics beyond the default, and I can't copy the implementation of Collectors.toSet() because of visibility issues. So, to set the UNORDERED characteristic I'm forced to do something like this: So here are my questions: 1. Is this my only option for creating an unordered collector for something as simple as a custom toSet() 2. If I want this to work ideally, is it necessary to apply the unordered characteristic? I've read a question on this forum where I learned that the unordered characteristic is no longer back-propagated into the Stream. Does it still serve a purpose? <code>  public static <T> Collector<T, ?, Set<T>> toSetSized(int initialCapacity) { return Collectors.toCollection(()-> new HashSet<>(initialCapacity));} Set<Foo> fooSet = myFooStream.collect(toSetSized(100000)); static<T> Collector<T,?,Set<T>> toSetSized(int initialCapacity){ return Collector.of( () -> new HashSet<>(initialCapacity), Set::add, (c1, c2) -> { c1.addAll(c2); return c1; }, new Collector.Characteristics[]{IDENTITY_FINISH, UNORDERED});}",Is it important to use Characteristics.UNORDERED in Collectors when possible?

Java BitSet vs Open BitSet," I was trying to implement a BloomFilter and came across some discussions regarding BitSets. The Lucene OpenBitSet claims that it is faster than the Java BitSet implementation in almost all of the operations.http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.apache.lucene/lucene-core/4.10.4/org/apache/lucene/util/OpenBitSet.java#OpenBitSet I tried to look at the code for both the implementations. Java BitSet codehttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/8u40-b25/java/util/BitSet.java#BitSetIt seems to me that both these classes use an array of 'long' to store the bits. Individual bits are mapped to a particular array index and a bit position in the 'long' value stored at the index. What is the reason, then that the OpenBitSet implementation is far better in terms of performance ? Where is the difference in the code that leads to this improvement in speed ?  <code> ",Java JDK BitSet vs Lucene OpenBitSet

Firebase Cloud Messaging notification from Java application instead of Firebase Console," I am new to Firebase and I am running into errors such as mismatch sender id and Authentication Error with HTTP status 401 when my Java application tries to send a notification/message using the client's Firebase token. Note that using Firebase Console, I am able to send the message to the client.For the client app, I did the following:Cloned Firebase messaging quickstart app from here -- https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android/tree/master/messaging -- which is already setup with Firebase dependencies and such. Loaded the cloned app in Android Studio.Using Firebase Console, created a new project called My Notification Client and added an app using com.google.firebase.quickstart.fcm as the package name of the Android app.Downloaded google-services.json file for the Android app added to the newly created project and copied it to the messaging/app/ folder and sync'd with Grade files from within Android Studio.Created an emulator and ran the app from within Android Studio. When the app got loaded in the emulator, clicked the Log Token button to capture the client's Firebase token in the Android Monitor tab in Android Studio.Using Firebase Console, selected the newly created project My Notification Client, clicked the Notifications link from the left pane, and sent a notification to the device by pasting the Firebase token captured in the previous step.This worked great! The next step was to to use a separate simple Java application (which would eventually become a notification server) to send the notification to the client instead of using Firebase Console.To accomplish this, I followed the steps outlined here -- https://firebase.google.com/docs/server/setup#prerequisites. Specifically, these are the steps that I performed: Created a new project called My Notification Server in Firebase Console.Using Settings > Permissions in Firebase Console, created a new service account and downloaded the serviceAccountCredentials.json file.Created a new maven project in Eclipse and added the following dependencies in pom.xml: Then, I extended com.google.android.gcm.sender.Sender to create FCMSender and override protected method getConnection(String url) to use the new FCM endpoint as shown below: The main() method of my Java application looks like this: When I run the Java application, I get MismatchSenderId error. I tried troubleshooting using curl as shown below but got the same error: Instead of using the Server Key listed on Project Settings > Cloud Messaging tab for My Notification Server project in Firebase Console, I tried using the Project Number but that caused InvalidRequestException: HTTP Status Code: 401.Firebase documentation of the error codes says this about MismatchSenderId: Mismatched Sender 200 + error:MismatchSenderId A registration token is tied to a certain group of senders. When a client app registers for FCM, it must specify which senders are allowed to send messages.

Is it important to copy reference before using in Java?," Exploring the code of java.util.LinkedList as it is in OpenJDK 8, I found the following code. The code is straightforward, but I'm confused about saving reference to the first node to a constant in the second line of code. As far as I understand, this code will be inlined to one-liner without reference copying. Am I right? If so, why does one need to copy reference in this and similar situations (such idiom may be found in a half of methods in java.util.LinkedList)? My first thought was that it helps concurrency in some way, but LinkedList does not allow concurrent access (except at your own risk), so I guess it is some hint for optimizer, but can't figure out how it is supposed to work. <code>  public E peek() { final Node<E> f = first; return (f == null) ? null : f.item;}",Is it important to copy a reference to a local variable before using it

Java rest api: @queryParam vs Bean," I am thinking of two options for handling query/request parameters:Map individual parameters to corresponding the method parameters: Map all parameters to the properties of a Java bean: The second option seems more attractive as it allows the validation logic of input query parameters to be moved and decoupled from the blah method whose core responsibility should be to process and delegating the validation to a validator should high degree of decoupling (and also SOLID principle, right?).However, most of the examples I see (in fact, the existing project I am working on) use only the first option. I am wondering if is there any reason why the second option is not widely used? Are there any pitfalls? Is this an anti-pattern? Is this against any best practice? <code>  @GETpublic String blah(@QueryParam(""testParam"") String testParam) {} @GETpublic String blah(@BeanParam RequestParamBean bean) {}",Should I use @QueryParam or @BeanParam in JAX-RS?
How to disable a node without greying it out in Javafx," My problem is being able to disable a Node such that a user can't interact with it while I'm printing it. By the same token though, I need for the overall Node (in this case a GridPane) and all of its children (Buttons and Labels primarily) to not be interactable by the user, while the print is going on.When I write setDisable, it greys the whole Node out, but I'd like to retain the original color and state of the Node while its disabled.Is there a way to do this? Either through the disableProperty or other means, doesn't particularly matter to me how. The key thing here is that you shouldn't be able to interact with the Node.Thanks in advance <code> ",How to disable a node without greying it out in JavaFX?
Customizing Spring Data repository bean names," I have a project that utilizes Spring Data (MongoDB in this instance) to interact with multiple databases with the same schema. What this means is that each database utilizes the same entity and repository classes. So, for example: This works fine if I am connecting to a single database, but things get more complicated when I want to connect to more than one database at the same time: I can create multiple instances of the same repository, using different MongoTemplate instances, but I don't know the correct way to reference and inject them. I would like to be able to inject the individual repository instances into different controllers, like so: Is a configuration like this possible? Can I somehow control the bean names of the instantiated interfaces so that I can reference them with @Resource or @Autowired? Bonus question: can this be accomplished with a custom repository factory as well? <code>  public class Thing { private String id; private String name; private String type; // etc... }public interface ThingRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository<Thing, String> { List<Thing> findByName(String name);}@Configuration@EnableMongoRepositories(basePackageClasses = { ThingRepository.class })public MongoConfig extends AbstractMongoConfiguration { // Standard mongo config} @Configuration@EnableMongoRepositories(basePackageClasses = { ThingRepository.class }, mongoTemplateRef = ""mongoTemplateOne"")public MongoConfigOne extends AbstractMongoConfiguration { @Override @Bean(name = ""mongoTemplateOne"") public MongoTemplate mongoTemplate() throws Exception { return new MongoTemplate(this.mongo(), ""db_one""); } // Remaining standard mongo config}@Configuration@EnableMongoRepositories(basePackageClasses = { ThingRepository.class }, mongoTemplateRef = ""mongoTemplateTwo"")public MongoConfigTwo extends AbstractMongoConfiguration { @Override @Bean(name = ""mongoTemplateTwo"") public MongoTemplate mongoTemplate() throws Exception { return new MongoTemplate(this.mongo(), ""db_two""); } // Remaining standard mongo config} @Controller@RequestMapping(""/things/one/"")public class ThingOneController { @Resource private ThingRepository thingRepositoryOne; ...}@Controller@RequestMapping(""/things/two/"")public class ThingTwoController { @Resource private ThingRepository thingRepositoryTwo; ...}",Customizing Spring Data repository bean names for use with multiple data sources

Why should I ever overload methods ( java)," I found two examples in my book of overloading methods, but it doesn't explain clearly exactly why it's useful: This is pretty straightforward, but honestly it seems pretty useless to method overload here, and it seems just doing it for the sake of doing it.The next example in the book does method overloading which seems a bit more useful, because that program calculates feet to centimeters, and there is one method where you can put in feet and inches, and one method where you can put inches. However, it still seems just as easy to make two separate methods for this.That being said, are there any real benefits to doing this? (I read this, but I am not really to satisfied. It seems just as easy to make new methods.) <code>  package keepo;public class Main{ public static void main(String [] args) { int newScore = calculateScore(""Tim"", 500); System.out.println(""New Score is"" + newScore); calculateScore(75); } public static int calculateScore(String playerName, int score){ System.out.println(""Player"" + playerName +""Has score"" + score); return score * 1000; } public static int calculateScore(int score){ System.out.println(""Unnamed player scored"" + score + ""points""); return score * 1000; }}",Why should I ever overload methods?
Error adding a Spring Session," In my Spring Boot 1.4 based application I use Spring Session to store session data in the database with JDBC.This works fine with the default session. But when I want to add a new session (by adding ?_s=1 to the application url) I get the following exception: What is the issue here?Edit: Note that I do not set the cookie value myself, Spring Session does that. Thus I can not tell which value it tries to set.The complete stacktrace is here: <code>  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: An invalid character [32] was present in the Cookie value

Apache Ignite Availability issue w/custom CacheStoreAdapter," I'm doing a PoC using apache ignite. Here is the scenario I'm testing:Start a cluster of 3 nodes and a client.Call get key. I log on node that caches this key.Call get key. I verify it gets stored value.Do a loadCache(). All nodes report successfully Loading cache.Kill node that originally loaded keyRestart node that I just killed.Query for key again.Steps 6 and 7 have some trouble. If I wait Long enough between the two everything works as it should. However if try to do 6 and 7 too close together then I get this error on the client and this error on the node. I see the error IgniteClientDisconnectedException: Failed to wait for topology update, client disconnected. However is there a way to avoid this issue? Setting a longer time to wait for a topology update isn't really an option because a client may try to connect at any time. Is it to do with my cluster configuration? I saw this documentation which suggests infinitely trying to connect which seems like it would just keep erring.Also, we would need to be able to dynamically grow/shrink the cluster. Is this possible? Would having in memory backups fix the functionality?Note, if I omit step 6 I've not seen it fail.Cluster Node Config Client Config Implemented methods of CacheStoreAdaptor <code>  <beans xmlns=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:schemaLocation="" http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd""> <!--<import resource=""./cache.xml""/>--> <bean id=""grid.cfg"" class=""org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration""> <property name=""peerClassLoadingEnabled"" value=""true""/> <property name=""cacheConfiguration""> <bean class=""org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration""> <!-- Set a cache name. --> <property name=""name"" value=""recordData""/> <!--<property name=""rebalanceMode"" value=""SYNC""/>--> <!-- Set cache mode. --> <property name=""cacheMode"" value=""PARTITIONED""/> <property name=""cacheStoreFactory""> <bean class=""javax.cache.configuration.FactoryBuilder"" factory-method=""factoryOf""> <constructor-arg value=""Application.RecordDataStore""/> </bean> </property> <property name=""readThrough"" value=""true""/> <property name=""writeThrough"" value=""true""/> </bean> </property> <property name=""discoverySpi""> <bean class=""org.apache.ignite.spi.discovery.tcp.TcpDiscoverySpi""> <!-- Override local port. --> <property name=""localPort"" value=""8000""/> </bean> </property> <property name=""communicationSpi""> <bean class=""org.apache.ignite.spi.communication.tcp.TcpCommunicationSpi""> <!-- Override local port. --> <property name=""localPort"" value=""8100""/> </bean> </property> </bean></beans> <beans xmlns=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:util=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/util"" xsi:schemaLocation="" http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd http://www.springframework.org/schema/util http://www.springframework.org/schema/util/spring-util.xsd""> <bean abstract=""true"" id=""ignite.cfg"" class=""org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration""> <!-- Set to true to enable distributed class loading for examples, default is false. --> <property name=""peerClassLoadingEnabled"" value=""true""/> <property name=""clientMode"" value=""true""/> <property name=""cacheConfiguration""> <bean class=""org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration""> <!-- Set a cache name. --> <property name=""name"" value=""recordData""/> <!--<property name=""rebalanceMode"" value=""SYNC""/>--> <!-- Set cache mode. --> <property name=""cacheMode"" value=""PARTITIONED""/> <property name=""cacheStoreFactory""> <bean class=""javax.cache.configuration.FactoryBuilder"" factory-method=""factoryOf""> <constructor-arg value=""com.digitaslbi.idiom.util.RecordDataStore""/> </bean> </property> <property name=""readThrough"" value=""true""/> <property name=""writeThrough"" value=""true""/> </bean> </property> <!-- Enable task execution events for examples. --> <property name=""includeEventTypes""> <list> <!--Task execution events--> <util:constant static-field=""org.apache.ignite.events.EventType.EVT_TASK_STARTED""/> <util:constant static-field=""org.apache.ignite.events.EventType.EVT_TASK_FINISHED""/> <util:constant static-field=""org.apache.ignite.events.EventType.EVT_TASK_FAILED""/> <util:constant static-field=""org.apache.ignite.events.EventType.EVT_TASK_TIMEDOUT""/> <util:constant static-field=""org.apache.ignite.events.EventType.EVT_TASK_SESSION_ATTR_SET""/> <util:constant static-field=""org.apache.ignite.events.EventType.EVT_TASK_REDUCED""/> <!--Cache events--> <util:constant static-field=""org.apache.ignite.events.EventType.EVT_CACHE_OBJECT_PUT""/> <util:constant static-field=""org.apache.ignite.events.EventType.EVT_CACHE_OBJECT_READ""/> <util:constant static-field=""org.apache.ignite.events.EventType.EVT_CACHE_OBJECT_REMOVED""/> </list> </property> <!-- Explicitly configure TCP discovery SPI to provide list of initial nodes. --> <property name=""discoverySpi""> <bean class=""org.apache.ignite.spi.discovery.tcp.TcpDiscoverySpi""> <property name=""ipFinder""> <!-- Ignite provides several options for automatic discovery that can be used instead os static IP based discovery.

How to split without regex," In my Java application I need to find indices and split strings using the same ""target"" for both occasions. The target is simply a dot.Finding indices (by indexOf and lastIndexOf) does not use regex, so gives me the index I need.However, I also want to use this ""target"" to split some strings. But now the target string is interpreted as a regex string. So I can't use the same target string as before when I want to split a string... So I need either of the following:A way to split into an array by a non-regex targetA way to ""convert"" a non-regex target string into a regex stringCan someone help? Would you agree that it seems a bit odd of the standard java platform to use regex for ""split"" while not using regex for ""indexOf""? <code>  String target = ""."";String someString = ""123.456"";int index = someString.indexOf(target); // index == 3 String target = ""."";String someString = ""123.456"";String[] someStringSplit = someString.split(target); // someStringSplit is an empty array",How to split String without regex

Kafka KStream - using a StateStore," I'm building a topology and want to use KStream.process() to write some intermediate values to a database.

Java code runs out of space memory on Ubuntu but not MacOSX," I need another set of eyes on this. I've written out a zip file into hundreds of gigabytes with this exact code with no modifications locally on MacOSX.With 100% unchanged code, just deployed to an AWS instance running Ubuntu, this same code runs into Out of Memory issues (heap space).Here's the code that's being run, streaming MyBatis to a CSV file on disk: Here's a graph of the JVM heap space (using jvisualvm) when I run this locally. I've run this consistently with of Java 8 (jdk1.8.0_51 and 1.8.0_112) locally and have gotten great results. Even written out a terabyte of data. ^ In the above, the max heap space is set to 4 gigs, and the most it ever increases to is 1.5 gigs, before going back down to around 500 MB, while streaming data to the CSV file as it's supposed to.However, when I run this on Ubuntu with jdk 1.8.0_111, the exact same operation will not complete, running out of heap space (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space)I've upped the Xmx value from 8 gigs to 16 to 25 gigs, and still run out of heap space. Meanwhile... the total size of the file is only 10 Gigs in total... which really perplexes me.Here's what the JVisualVm graph looks like on the Ubuntu box:I've no doubt it's the exact same code running in both environments, with the same operation being performed in each (same database server providing the same data)The only differences I can think of at this point are:Operating system - Ubuntu vs Mac OS XHosted VM in AWS vs hard metal laptopNetwork speed is faster in AWS between database and Ubuntu serverJDK version is 1.8.0_111 in Ubuntu, tried 1.8.0_51 and 1.8.0_112 locallyCan anyone help shed any light on this problem?UpdateI've tried replacing all the 'try-with-resources' statements with explicit flush/close statements and no luck.What's more, I tried to force a garbage collection on the Ubuntu box as soon as I started to see the data come in, and it had no effect-- there is something definitely stopping the heap from being collected on the Ubuntu machine... while running the exact same code on OS X let me write the full enchilada again no problem.Update 2In addition to the differences in the environments above, the only other difference I can think of is if the connection between the servers in AWS is so fast that it streams the data faster than it can flush the data to disk... but that still doesn't explain the issue where I only have 10 gigs of data total, and it blows up a JVM with 20 Gigs of heap space.Is there any likelihood of there being a bug at the Ubuntu/Java level for this?Update 3Tried replacing the output of the CSVPrinter to use an entirely separate library (OpenCSV's CSVWriter in lieu of Apache's CSV library) and the same result occurs.As soon as this code starts receiving data from the database, the heap starts blowing up and the garbage collector fails to reclaim any memory... but only on Ubuntu. On OS X, everything is reclaimed immediately and the heap never grows.I've also tried flushing the stream after every write, but had no luck with that as well.Update 4Got the heap dump to print out, and according to this I should be looking at the database driver. Specifically the InboundDataHandler in amazon's redshift driver. I'm using myBatis with a custom result handler. I tried setting the result handler to effectively do nothing when it gets a result (new ResultHandler<>() { // method overridden to do literally nothing}) and I know I'm not holding on to any references there.Since it's the InboundDataHandler defined by AWS/Redshift... it makes me think it may be lower than the myBatis level... either:Error in the SqlSessionFactory I'm setting upBug in the Redshift driver that only pops up in Ubuntu / AWSBug in the result handler I have overwrittenHere's the heap dump screenshot:Here's where I'm setting up my SqlSessionFactoryBean: Here's the myBatis code I'm running as a test to verify that it's not me holding on to records in my ResultHandler: Is there a way I can force the SQL connection to not hang on to records or something? I'll again re-iterate that on my local machine, there is no issue with this memory leak... it only surfaces when running the code in the hosted AWS environment. And in both cases, the Database driver and server are the same.Update 6I think it's finally fixed. Thanks to all who pointed me in the direction of the heap dump. That helped narrow it down to the offending class in a huge way. After that, I did some research on the AWS redshift driver, and it explicitly says that your clients should specify a limit for any operations on large data. So I found out how to do that in my myBatis configuration: And this did the trick. Mind you, this isn't necessary even when handling much larger data sets downloaded remotely from AWS (Database in AWS, code executing on laptop at home), and this shouldn't be necessary since I'm overriding the myBatis ResultHandler<> which handles each row individually and never holds on to any objects.Yet something funky happens with the AWS redshift jdbc driver only when it's run in AWS (database in aws, code executing in AWS instance) which causes this InboundDataHandler to never release its resources, unless a fetchSize is specified.Here's the heap of the server running now, getting much further than it ever has before in AWS, with the heap space never moving above 500Mb, and after i hit 'force gc' in jvisualvm, it shows the 'used' heap at less than 100mb:Thanks again in a huge way to all those who helped guide this! <code>  File directory = new File(feedDirectory); File file; try { file = File.createTempFile((""feed-"" + providerCode + ""-""), "".csv"", directory); } catch (IOException e) { throw new RuntimeException(""Unable to create file to write feed to disk: "" + e.getMessage(), e); } String filePath = file.getAbsolutePath(); log.info(String.format(""File name for %s feed is %s"", providerCode, filePath)); // output file try (FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file)) { streamData(out, providerCode, startDate, endDate); } catch (IOException e) { throw new RuntimeException(""Unable to write feed to file: "" + e.getMessage()); } public void streamData(OutputStream outputStream, String providerCode, Date startDate, Date endDate) throws IOException { try (CSVPrinter printer = CsvUtil.openPrinter(outputStream)) { StreamingHandler<FStay> handler = stayPrintingHandler(printer); warehouse.doForAllStaysByProvider(providerCode, startDate, endDate, handler); }}private StreamingHandler<FStay> stayPrintingHandler(CSVPrinter printer) { StreamingHandler<FStay> handler = new StreamingHandler<>(); handler.setHandler((stay) -> { try { EXPORTER.writeStay(printer, stay); } catch (IOException e) { log.error(""Issue with writing output: "" + e.getMessage(), e); } }); return handler;}// The EXPORTER method import org.apache.commons.csv.CSVPrinter; public void writeStay(CSVPrinter printer, FStay stay) throws IOException { List<Object> list = asList(stay); printer.printRecord(list);}List<Object> asList(FStay stay) { List<Object> list = new ArrayList<>(46); list.add(stay.getUid()); list.add(stay.getProviderCode()); //.... return list;} @Beanpublic javax.sql.DataSource redshiftDataSource() throws ClassNotFoundException { log.info(""Got to datasource config""); // Dynamically load driver at runtime.

"log4.properties gets overwritten when creating a ""fat-JAR"" using Gradle"," One of my Java projects exports an executable ""fat-JAR"" file ready for deployment. For creating the JAR file using Gradle, I followed the instructions described here: The task illustrated will recursively go through dependency tree, unzip JARs if needed, and squash everything together. The only problem so far is that some of my dependencies come with their own log4.properties files, which eventually overwrite the one I have written myself. All of them reside within the same level into their respective resources folders, so when files get merged together, the later ones seem to overwrite the ones that have been added before. So far, the only solution I have found, is to manually set the path to the right file, using a command-line parameter.

java-9 weakCompareAndSwap vs compareAndSwap," This question is not about the difference between them - I know what spurious failure is and why it happens on LL/SC. My question is if I'm on intel x86 and using java-9 (build 149), why is there a difference between their assembly code? Running with: Output of compareAndSwapInt(relevant parts): Output of weakCompareAndSwapInt: I am by far not versatile enough to understand the entire output, but can definitely see the difference between lock addl and lock cmpxchg.EDITPeter's answer got me thinking. Let's see if compareAndSwap will be an intrinsic call: -XX:+PrintIntrinsics -XX:-PrintAssembly And then run the example twice with/without: -XX:DisableIntrinsic=_compareAndSwapIntThis is sort of weird, the output is exactly the same (same exact instructions) with the only differences that with enable intrinsic I get calls like this: And disabled: This is rather intriguing, shouldn't the intrinsic code be different?EDIT-2 the8472 makes sense too. lock addl is a substitute for mfence that flushes the StoreBuffer on x86 as far as I know and it has to do with visibility and not atomicity indeed. Right before this entry, is: If you look here is will delegate to another native call to Atomic:: cmpxchg that seems to be doing the swap atomically.

I am using following technology :1) MYSQL + PHP (RESTful Web Services)2) Android Studio (Java)In the application, I have to run some complex algorithms for ranking users collecting data from different tables from database stored in cloud server.My question is ""where to run this algorithms?"". Should I write code in PHP to make the algorithms run in server side and then send this data to client (or) Should I write the code in JAVA (Android Studio) using data collected from server.How will the performance of my app differs in both cases?Edit : Thanks for all your responses. I have idea on Async Tasks and Multi Threading. This doubt came to me as ranking is common for all my users, there is a difference. If I put raking algorithm in server side, even though the results are same for all users, the same algorithm has to run for several times (say if there are 10000 users, the same algorithm runs for 10000 times on server side). But if I do put in client side, I may over come this. But need expert solution on this. <code> ",Where to run complex algorithms? Server side or Client side?

Behavior of method with @Produces annotation without scope," I've got a method with a @Produces annotation that creates an Apple.When I use it with @ApplicationScoped like this then the Apple gets created only once for the whole application.When I use it with @RequestScoped like this then it gets created for every request.But what if I do not specify a scope? How often will the Apple be created? I suspect on every access, is it correct? Is there documentation about this? <code>  public class AppleProducer { @ApplicationScoped @Produces public Apple createApple() { return new Apple(); }} public class AppleProducer { @RequestScoped @Produces public Apple createApple() { return new Apple(); }} public class AppleProducer { @Produces public Apple createApple() { return new Apple(); }}",What's the default scope for a bean created by a @Produces method without a scope annotation?

What happen if i don't close the kafka producer," I'm processing xml's and I need to send a message per record, when I receive the last record I close the kafka producer, the problem here is that the send method of the kafka producer is async, therefore, sometimes when I close the producer it trows java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot send after the producer is closed. I've read somewhere that I can leave the producer open. My question is: What does it imply, or if there is a better solution for this.---Edit--- Imagine the following scenario:We read the tag and we create the kafka producerPer each element we read its attributes, generate a json object and send it to kafka using the send method.-When we read the element we call the close method in the producerProblem the number of elements can be 80k therefore, sometimes when we call the disconnect method it continues sending the messages in an async way. So we need to call the flush method first but it impacts the performance <code>  <list> <element attr1="""" att2="""" attr3=""""/> <element attr1="""" att2="""" attr3=""""/> <element attr1="""" att2="""" attr3=""""/> <element attr1="""" att2="""" attr3=""""/> <element attr1="""" att2="""" attr3=""""/> <element attr1="""" att2="""" attr3=""""/> <element attr1="""" att2="""" attr3=""""/> <element attr1="""" att2="""" attr3=""""/>...</list>",What happens if I don't close the kafka producer

Usage of Spring's Mock MVC," I have seen people around me using Spring MVC in unit tests for controller classes, which is not helpful in what a unit test is for.Unit tests are supposed to test your actual implementation of the controller class, and this can be achieved more accurately with simple Junit tests rather than using Spring Mock MVC.But then the question arises, what's the real usage of Spring Mock MVC then? What do you need it for?Let's say I have below code : I can test this class/controller more accurately with Junit than with Spring Mock MVC (all it does is generates some json which can be asserted with junit).I can also test with Spring Mock MVC like using the correct endpoint returns the correct HTTP status and correct response page string. But doesn't that mean that we are testing Spring MVC's functionality rather than the actual code for method under test?P.S. : I have kept the code to minimal which I think is sufficient to explain my question. Assume there is no compilation error. <code>  @Controller@RequestMapping(""/systemusers"")public class SystemUserController{ @RequestMapping(value = ""/{id}"", method = RequestMethod.GET) public String getUser(final Model model) { // some logic to return user's details as json return UserDetailsPage; } }",Why use Spring's Mock MVC when you have unit tets of your controller classes
what is the Concrete class in java," According to this document, and many similar documents, a concrete class is described as: A concrete class in Java is any such class which has implementation of all of its inherited members either from interface or abstract classAnd can used like this: In the above example class C is a concrete class.Is this the only way to create a concrete class. Can you give me more info about concrete class? <code>  public abstract class A { public abstract void methodA();}interface B { public void printB();}public class C extends A implements B { public void methodA() { System.out.print(""I am abstract implementation""); } public void printB() { System.out.print(""I am interface implementation""); }}",What is the Concrete class in java
Test that startup an Spring-boot application," I have a JUnit test that starts an spring-boot application (in my case, the main class is SpringTestDemoApp) after the test: Everything works fine using spring-boot 1.3.3.RELEASE.

How to collect Java 8 collection items from java 8 stream.filter() when it returns false?," Consider the following code: What I am trying to do here is get the even and odd values from a list into separate lists. The stream filter() method returns true for even items and the stream collector will collect them.For the odd case, the filter will return false and the item will never reach the collector. So I am adding such odd numbers in another list I created before under the else block. I know this is not an elegant way of working with streams. For example if I use a parallel stream then there will be thread safety issue with the odd list. I cannot run it multiple times with different filters because of performance reasons (should be O(n)).This is just an example for one use-case, the list could contain any object and the lambda inside the filter needs to separate them based on some logic into separate lists. In simple terms: from a list create multiple lists containing items separated based on some criteria. Without streams it would be just to run a for loop and do simple if-else and collect the items based on the conditions.  <code>  List<Integer> odd = new ArrayList<Integer>(); List<Integer> even = null; List<Integer> myList = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10); even = myList.stream() .filter(item -> { if(item%2 == 0) { return true;} else { odd.add(item); return false; } }) .collect(Collectors.toList());",How to separate a List by a condition using Java 8 streams

CtCI QV1.11 Big O Printing sorted strings," This question is from Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition, Question V1.11. The following code prints all strings of length k where the characters are in sorted order. It does this by generating all strings of length k and then checking if each is sorted. What is the runtime? The answer is O(k c^k) where k is the length of the string and c is the number of characters in the alphabet. It takes O(c^k) time to generate each string. Then, we need to check that each of these is sorted, which takes O(k) time.Now, I understand where O(k) comes from but I don't see how O(c^k) came about.  <code>  package QVI_11_Print_Sorted_Strings;public class Question { public static int numChars = 26; public static void printSortedStrings(int remaining) { printSortedStrings(remaining, """"); } public static void printSortedStrings(int remaining, String prefix) { if (remaining == 0) { if (isInOrder(prefix)) { System.out.println(prefix); } } else { for (int i = 0; i < numChars; i++) { char c = ithLetter(i); printSortedStrings(remaining - 1, prefix + c); } } } public static boolean isInOrder(String s) { for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) { int prev = ithLetter(s.charAt(i - 1)); int curr = ithLetter(s.charAt(i)); if (prev > curr) { return false; } } return true; } public static char ithLetter(int i) { return (char) (((int) 'a') + i); } public static void main(String[] args) { printSortedStrings(5); }}","Why is the time complexity of this example from ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" O(k c^k)?"

I would like to keep to the LocalDate class. I'm using the class like this: I am looking a solution that will take in account time zones. If a license was set to expire in 3 days, and the user was to travel to a different time zone. i.e. they could be ahead or behind based on hours. The license should still expire. <code>  import org.threeten.bp.LocalDate;public final class Utilities { private Utilities() {} public static boolean hasDateExpired(int days, LocalDate savedDate, LocalDate currentDate) { boolean hasExpired = false; if(savedDate != null && currentDate != null) { /* has expired if the saved date plus the specified days is still before the current date (today) */ if(savedDate.plusDays(days).isBefore(currentDate)) { hasExpired = true; } } return hasExpired; }} private void showDialogToIndicateLicenseHasExpired() { final LocalDate currentDate = LocalDate.now(); final int DAYS_TO_EXPIRE = 3; final LocalDate savedDate = user.getSavedDate(); if(hasDateExpired(DAYS_TO_EXPIRE, savedDate, currentDate)) { /* License has expired, warn the user */ }}",Calcuting the date difference for a specified number of days using LocalDate class

Why Arrays.copyOf is 2 times faster than System.arraycopy for small arrays?," I was recently playing with some benchmarks and found very interesting results that I can't explain right now.

Spring rollback on an application exception, One way to configure Spring to rollback on a non RuntimeExceptions is using @Transactional(rollbackFor=...) annotation on the service classes. The problem with this approach is that we need to define (rollbackFor=...) for almost all the service classes which seems really redundant. My question: Is there any way to configure a default behaviour for Spring transaction manager to rollback on a non RuntimeException whenever it happens without declaring it on every @Transactional annotation. Something like using @ApplicationException(rollback=true) annotation on an exception class in EJB. <code> ,Spring: automatic rollback on checked exceptions

QuestionWhy weren't subtypes used to model empty and non-empty cases?I'm not specifically asking why Optional is final, rather why it wasn't implemented with Some and None, as many other languages do, so Why is optional declared as a final class is not really helpful. <code>  public<U> Optional<U> map(Function<? super T, ? extends U> mapper) { Objects.requireNonNull(mapper); if (!isPresent()) return empty(); else { return Optional.ofNullable(mapper.apply(value)); }} optional .map(i -> i) // isPresent() .map(Object::toString) // isPresent() .map(String::length) // isPresent() .map(...) // isPresent()","Why is Java 8 Optional implemented as final, without Some and None hierarchy?"

How to import a CSV file into a BigQuery table without column names or schema?," I'm currently writing a Java utility to import few CSV files from GCS into BigQuery. I can easily achieve this by bq load, but I wanted to do it using a Dataflow job. So I'm using Dataflow's Pipeline and ParDo transformer (returns TableRow to apply it on the BigQueryIO) and I have created the StringToRowConverter() for the transformation. Here the actual problem starts - I am forced to specify the schema for the destination table although I don't want to create a new table if it doesn't exist - only trying to load data. So I do not want to manually set the column name for the TableRow as I have about 600 columns. Moreover, it is assumed that the table already exists in the BigQuery dataset and I don't need to create it, and also the CSV file contains the columns in a correct order.If there's no workaround to this scenario and the column name is needed for the data load, then I can have it in the first row of the CSV file.Any help will be appreciated. <code>  public class StringToRowConverter extends DoFn<String, TableRow> {private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(StringToRowConverter.class);public void processElement(ProcessContext c) { TableRow row = new TableRow(); row.set(""DO NOT KNOW THE COLUMN NAME"", c.element()); c.output(row);}}",How to import a CSV file into a BigQuery table without any column names or schema?

How does condumer auto commit work?," I am reading this one: Automatic Commit The easiest way to commit offsets is to allow the consumer to do it for you.

But when i generate *.aar file (with gradle -> assembleRelease) and include into separate project - it fails. Project see ONLY MY library's class. Hawk com.orhanobut.hawk package and ofc others (if i will use then) are not visible. So ClassNotFoundException comes.If i remove the result doesnt change.I tried to add the following line into proguard file (library.pro) Result is the same.So i have two question:1 - what should i do to make my main project see my library's third party dependencies?2 - is is possible to obfuscate my library's code (only mine, not dependencies)? <code>  apply plugin: 'com.android.library'buildscript { repositories { maven { url ""https://www.jitpack.io"" } }}android { compileSdkVersion 26 buildToolsVersion ""26.0.1"" defaultConfig { minSdkVersion 18 targetSdkVersion 26 versionCode 1 versionName ""1.0"" testInstrumentationRunner ""android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"" } buildTypes { release { minifyEnabled true proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'library.pro' } }}dependencies { compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar']) androidTestCompile('com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.2', { exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-annotations' }) compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:26.0.2' compile 'com.github.orhanobut:hawk:1.23' testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'} minifyEnabled true proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'library.pro' -keep class com.orhanobut.hawk {public *;}-keep class com.orhanobut.hawk.* {public *;}",Android aar library doesn't contain dependencies
Java 9 module dependencies on legacy jars," I'm trying to migrate some legacy applications to the new Java 9 module system, to strengthen its encapsulation.I'm starting from the outside-in, with the assumption that classes on the periphery will have the least external dependencies.As you'd expect, I've declared a very open module to start with: This instantly breaks the entire project (inside all classes), when suddenly every import for an external dependency no longer resolves (causing over 1k Java problems): The import com.otherexample cannot be resolved The import org.springframework cannot be resolved etc.Local packages in the same project com.example.price still work - as do java.util etc.All of the external dependencies are (were) managed with Maven. In the (Eclipse project) build path, I can still see them as ""Classpath"" dependencies - but only the JRE system libraries in the ""Modulepath"".Can the two concepts co-exist? Currently it seems by having a single module-info.java anywhere in the project, all classpath dependencies stop working?I did read about using automatic modules, which seemed to imply you could use legacy / non-modular jars by including them in your modulepath, then referring to them by their filename. They use the example: I couldn't find much other info, but this appears to match the convention Eclipse uses when it auto-generates a module-info.java for example: becomes: However, this still results in a Java error reported by Eclipse: spring.core cannot be resolved to a moduleMaven reports: ...and every class in the project with an external dependency is still broken. <code>  module com.example.user { exports com.example.user;} module com.foo.myapp { requires guava; // guava not yet modularised, so use the filename} spring-core-4.3.8.RELEASE.jar requires spring.core; [ERROR] module-info.java:[39,16] error: module not found: spring.core",Java 9 automatic module dependencies cannot be resolved / module not found
Android hide navigation bar (using cosu)," I am on android 6. Looking for solutiong where I can hide and disable nav bar with soft keys(home, back, recent).

But I didnt find any method to do it. I already locked an activity, but still can call nav bar with swipe up. Maybe someone here knows it.  <code> ",Hide navigation bar?

Mongo: trying to read Long from JSON causes java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Long," I have a code that reads data in a specific format from MongoDB. I need to test it.In order to do so, I create a JSON with the data I want to test: This is the object that supposed to be created: I have a code that reads a JSON file and creates a Mongo document, and write to a DB: Once the data is written, there's a code that tries to read the data from MongoDB and populate it into a MyObject instance: Which fails on a error message: Because of the line serial = doc.getLong(DBConstants.SERIAL);. It basically gets the number from my JSON as ""Integer"" thus unable to read it as long.I've tried the following line, and it works: But is it the best solution here? Will .toString() always gets me the string representation of a number? Is there a way to keep a number in JSON that would cause it to be read as Long?Update:@glytching gave an excellent answer!I also discovered another way, apparently if you wrap the numerical elemnt of JSON in NumberLong it will be parsed as Long when translated from Mongo document.So using the old code, I was able to make it work by changing my JSON like so: <code>  { ""id"": ObjectId(""57552e32e4b0839ede67e0af""), ""serial"" : 574000690, ""startDate"" : ISODate(""2016-08-22T23:01:56.000Z""), ""endDate"" : ISODate(""2016-10-22T22:01:56.000Z""), ""reason"": """"} public static class MyObject implements Serializable{ private String id; private long serial; private Date startDate; private Date endDate; private String reason;} List<Document> docs = dirAsDbObjects(dir + File.separator + subDir.getName()).collect(Collectors.toList());docs.forEach(docManipulator);docs.forEach(doc -> doc.putIfAbsent(""_id"", new ObjectId()));ret.addAll(docs);MongoDatabase db = mongoClient.getDatabase(dbName);MongoCollection<Document> coll = db.getCollection(subDir.getName());List<InsertOneModel<Document>> inserts = docs.stream().map(InsertOneModel::new).collect(Collectors.toList());coll.bulkWrite(inserts); public MyObject(Document doc) { id = doc.getObjectId(DBConstants.ID).toString(); serial = doc.getLong(DBConstants.SERIAL); startDate = doc.getDate(""startDate""); reason = doc.getString(""source""); } java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Long Long.parseLong(doc.get(DBConstants.SERIAL).toString()) { ""id"": ObjectId(""57552e32e4b0839ede67e0af""), ""serial"" : NumberLong(574000690), ""startDate"" : ISODate(""2016-08-22T23:01:56.000Z""), ""endDate"" : ISODate(""2016-10-22T22:01:56.000Z""), ""reason"": """"}",MongoDB: trying to read Long from JSON causes java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Long

Java 9: Any VM supporting Process.supportsNormalTermination==true?," A new feature of Java 9 is that it can not only forcefully kill processes (in the meaning of SIGKILL) it had created but it may also support to send a SIGTERM (in Java called ""normal termination"").According to the documentation of Process one can query if the implementation supports this: public boolean supportsNormalTermination() Returns true if the implementation of destroy() is to normally terminate the process, Returns false if the implementation of destroy forcibly and immediately terminates the process. Invoking this method on Process objects returned by ProcessBuilder.start() and Runtime.exec(java.lang.String) return true or false depending on the platform implementation.I made some tests using Oracle JRE 9.0.1 (Windows 64bit): However it seems like Oracle JRE does not supports ""normal termination"" as I always get false.As it depends on the ""platform implementation"" it seems that Java 9 defines it but does not implement it. Does anybody know if the feature of ""normal termination"" is usable at all in any available Java VM? <code>  Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(""javaw -cp target/classes TestClassWait10Minutes"");p.waitFor(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);System.out.println(p.supportsNormalTermination());",Any VM supporting Process.supportsNormalTermination==true?

Checking if a particular value exists in the firebase database," I am making an Android application using Firebase realtime database. When a new user registers on my app, that user's data is saved in the Firebase database. A user has to provide the following details to register:Full NameEmail UsernamePasswordDatabase StructureWhenever a new user tries to register, I have to make sure that each user's username is unique so I check the database if the username entered by the user already exists in the database or not.To do this, I wrote the following method: My logic behind this method is that if getReference method cannot find reference to the specified path, it will return null so that I can return whether fdbRefer is null or not. If fdbRefer is null, then it means that username doesn't exist in the database.ProblemProblem with this method is that it always returns true whether the entered username exists in the database or not. Which led me to believe that fdbRefer is never null. This brings me to my question... QuestionWhat does getReference method return when it can't find the specified path in the firebase database and what's the correct way to check if the username already exists in the database or not? <code>  private boolean usernameExists(String username) { DatabaseReference fdbRefer = FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().getReference(""Users/""+username); return (fdbRefer != null);}",Checking if a particular value exists in the Firebase database
Initialize varible by evaluating lambda directly," I am wondering if there is a way to call .apply() or .get() on a lambda function directly in the same expression it is defined. The question came to mind when I wanted to initialize a variable which could be private, but I cannot declare it final because the value is the return value of a function that can throw an exception. As an example, consider Files.size(path): Now, if I want to use a default value for s if there is an exception, I have to add a try/catch, but this is a statement and not an expression: The obvious solution is to just declare a small helper function that wraps the try/catch, e.g. getFileSizeOrZero. I could also write a generic function that wraps this as a general case. This is nice and descriptive, but a more local function approach whould be better.In C++, I used lambdas: so I wondering if this can be done in Java. The best I could come up with was This seems to be quite expressive, so I am hoping that there is some syntac that I don't know enabling It seems that the problem is there is no function call operator as in C++, so there has to be a named member function which can be called. <code>  final s = Files.size(path); // code that uses s s = 0;try { s = Files.size();}catch (IOException e) {} // code that uses s const s = []() { try { return Files.size(path); } catch (...) { return 0; }}(); final int s = new IntSupplier() { @Override public int getAsInt() { try { return Files.size(path); } catch (IOException e) { return 0; } } }.getAsInt(); final int s = () -> { try { return Files.size(path); } catch (IOException e) { return 0; }}.apply();",Initialize variable by evaluating lambda directly

How coroutines implemented in JVM langs without JVM support?," This question came up after reading the Loom proposal, which describes an approach of implementing coroutines in the Java programming language.Particularly this proposal says that to implement this feature in the language, additional JVM support will be required.As I understand it there are already several languages on the JVM that have coroutines as part of their feature set such as Kotlin and Scala.So how is this feature implemented without additional support and can it be implemented efficiently without it? <code> ",How are coroutines implemented in JVM langs without JVM support?

Can one design ApplicationScoped beans with Constructor injection with CDI?," I'm trying to apply the constructor injection pattern to beans in my CDI application and am encountering the following error message: Indeed, in order to use the constructor injection pattern, I have intentionally designed my class with a single constructor requiring arguments: Looking through the CDI Specs of Unproxyable bean types, I see that: 3.15. Unproxyable bean types The container uses proxies to provide certain functionality. Certain legal bean types cannot be proxied by the container: classes which dont have a non-private constructor with no parameters, classes which are declared final, classes which have non-static, final methods with public, protected or default visibility, primitive types, and array types. A bean type must be proxyable if an injection point resolves to a bean: that requires a client proxy, or that has an associated decorator, or that has a bound interceptor. Otherwise, the container automatically detects the problem, and treats it as a deployment problem.And in further in section Normal scopes and pseudo-scopes it states: All normal scopes must be explicitly declared @NormalScope, to indicate to the container that a client proxy is required.Given @ApplicationScoped beans are by definition @NormalScope, I need to have a non-private no-args constructor. So then I need to have a protected no-arg constructor just to satisfy the CDI spec? I've tried with a protected no-args constructor, and it seems to work, but I do not understand how WELD is working in that case; in which conditions does it use the no-args constructor? Why is this a requirement in CDI at all?Does Weld only use the no-arg to create the proxy, but when actually calling the underlying implementation, it uses the inject-based constructor with arguments?  <code>  15:18:11,852 ERROR [izone.adams.webapp.error.IzoneExceptionHandler] (default task-40) org.jboss.weld.exceptions.UnproxyableResolutionException: WELD-001435: Normal scoped bean class webapp.util.LoginManagerAction is not proxyable because it has no no-args constructor - <unknown javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Bean instance>. at org.jboss.weld.bean.proxy.DefaultProxyInstantiator.validateNoargConstructor(DefaultProxyInstantiator.java:50) @ApplicationScoped@Typed(LoginManagerAction.class)public class LoginManagerAction extends UtilBasicDispatchAction { @Inject public LoginManagerAction( SessionManager sessionManager, JMSHealthCheckService jmsHealthCheckService) { super(); this.sessionManager = sessionManager; this.jmsHealthCheckService = jmsHealthCheckService; } ... ...}",Why do I need a no-args constructor to use ApplicationScoped beans with Constructor injection within CDI?

It doesn't generate a query in the console...If I use ScheduledFuture.isDone() the run method isn't invoked at all...EDIT:So i dug further into that problem and this is what i found out where it stops working:I used scheduledFuture.get() to wait for the task completionFirst line of code in run() method of AnalysisCleaningThread gets called which should call the service to retrieve a List of AnalysisCglibAopProxy is called to intercept the methodReflectiveMethodInvocation -> TransactionInterceptor -> TransactionAspectSupport -> DefaultListableBeanFactory -> AbstractBeanFactory is called to search and match the PlatformTransactionManager bean by typeDefaultSingletonBeanRegistry.getSingleton is called with beanName ""main"" and at line 187 synchronized(this.singletonObjects) the application pauses and never continuesFrom my point of view it seems like this.singletonObjects is currently in use so the thread cannot continue somehow... <code>  @Configuration@EnableTransactionManagementpublic class SpringConfig { @Bean public TaskScheduler taskScheduler() { return new ThreadPoolTaskScheduler(); }} @SpringBootApplication@ComponentScan(""..."")@EntityScan(""..."")@EnableJpaRepositories(""... .repositories"")@EnableAutoConfiguration@PropertySources(value = {@PropertySource(""classpath:application.properties"")})public class Main { private final static Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class); private static SpringApplication application = new SpringApplication(Main.class); private TaskScheduler taskScheduler; private AnalysisCleaningThread cleaningThread; @Inject public void setCleaningThread(AnalysisCleaningThread cleaningThread) { this.cleaningThread = cleaningThread; } @Inject public void setTaskScheduler(TaskScheduler taskScheduler) { this.taskScheduler = taskScheduler; } public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { try { //Do some setup application.run(args); } catch (Exception e) { LOGGER.error(e.getMessage(), e); } } @PostConstruct public void init() throws Exception { //Do some setup as well ScheduledFuture scheduledFuture = null; LOGGER.info(""********** Scheduling one time Cleaning Thread.

WorldWind Point Placemark Heading," In NASA WorldWind Java, I'm using PointPlacemark to represent an image because it stays the same size regardless of zoom level. The problem is that I want to set the heading on the Point Placemark and have it stay on that compass heading even when the camera is tilted. It works exactly as I want when viewing an untilted globe, but when I tilt, the placemark continues to face the screen instead of tilting with the globe, which causes it to act strange. Here is a GIF illustrating what I'm seeing: https://giphy.com/embed/3o7WIqZUceR8xh6BOgI would like the Point Placemark Image to stay on a heading relative to the globe, even when tilted -- so the image essentially is ""flattened"" as the view is tilted, while still remaining the same size regardless of zoom level. Here is a code snippet that I'm using. I am setting attrs.setHeadingReference(AVKey.RELATIVE_TO_GLOBE); on the associated PointPlacemarkAttributes. In this example, I am setting the heading to 135 degrees. I've also played with using a Polygon with a Texture applied to it.

Securely Export Java Modules," I was answering this question, where I recommended utilizing exports to syntax to prevent external consumers from accessing code that is intended for internal use between modules.But on further reflection, the only real safety checking that modules implement is that it matches the name. Consider this example where I am implementing two modules: The package unsafe contains code that would be unsafe to have exposed. Is there any way to securely export this to internal modules without exposing them externally?In the above example, a rogue entity could simply name their module b and would gain access to the code (not secure). The JLS doesn't seem to spell out anything that can prevent it. <code>  module a { exports unsafe to b}module b { requires a}",Securely Export Packages to Java Modules

Java - Execute command displaying console window and also get handle of the process," I am trying to run a command from Java that will start a process that runs for several minutes. I need to just trigger the command and get the process handle and continue with other operations in a loop. At regular intervals, I will have to monitor that the process is still active. I also need the console window to display to show the output of the process for the user.Currently, I have tried methods from both Runtime and ProcessBuilder classes to run my command but neither of them has helped me achieve my objective.Sample code: The value of variable alive is True, but I don't see the process got started. When the program execution is complete, only then the process starts and I am not sure why that happens. Also to display the console window, I found from google that I need to use the below command: However, with this, the process starts immediately but I do not get the process handle as I find the alive variable shows false.Does someone know how this objective can be achieved? I am ok if it's not possible to do both at the same time but at least I need to get the process execution to start and get the handle to monitor the process state later in my code. <code>  //Changing the directory and running Maven exec: java command on the POM file in that directory.String cmd = ""cd C:/Test & mvn exec:java""; String finalCmd = ""cmd /c \""""+ cmd +""\"""";Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(finalCmd);Thread.sleep(10);boolean alive = process.isAlive(); String finalCmd = ""cmd /c start cmd.exe /c \"""" + cmd + ""\"""";",Execute command displaying console window and also get handle of the process

Why does intelliJ-IDEA think my Boolean method is always inverted when it is not?," I'm new to using IntelliJ Idea and I have the following code: Now IntelliJ-IDEA complains that this Boolean method is always inverted. But I specifically wrote the method so it returns a positive, I do not want to make a method isInvalidToken or something like that. I believe the point of this warning is actually to avoid negatives such as those.What's more, if I actually let IntelliJ invert the method automatically, it makes the expression like this which is exactly NOT what I would want as it is much harder to reason about (even if I would rewrite the date comparison) Why is it doing this? I can disable the warning of course, but I'd rather not. <code>  private boolean verifyToken(TokenTypeEnum expectedTokenType, Token token) { return token != null && token.getTokenType() == expectedTokenType && token.getExpiryDate().isAfter(Instant.now());} private boolean newNegativeMethod(TokenTypeEnum expectedTokenType, Token token) { return token == null || token.getTokenType() != expectedTokenType || !token.getExpiryDate().isAfter(Instant.now());}",Why does IntelliJ IDEA think my Boolean method is always inverted when it is not?

Producer / Consumer - Synchronization only on single-threaded producer side," I stumbled upon this article on IBM - developerworks, and the code they posted had me raise some questions:Why is the building of the local variable Map wrapped within a synchronized block? Note that they implicitly say there is only one producer thread.Actually, why would this snippet require a synchronized block at all? A volatile variable should be enough for the job, as the newly created map is published only after being filled up.What is the point of only one thread synchronizing on a lock object?The article mentions: The synchronized block and the volatile keyword in Listing 1 are required because no happens-before relationship exists between the writes to the currentMap and the reads from currentMap. As a result, reading threads could see garbage if the synchronized block and the volatile keyword were not used.And the comment in the code says: this must be synchronized because of the Java memory modelI feel I'm dealing with multi-threading concepts outside of my understanding; I'd like someone with more expertise to point me in the right direction.Here is the snippet taken from the article: <code>  static volatile Map currentMap = null; // this must be volatilestatic Object lockbox = new Object(); public static void buildNewMap() { // this is called by the producer Map newMap = new HashMap(); // when the data needs to be updated synchronized (lockbox) { // this must be synchronized because // of the Java memory model // .. do stuff to put things in newMap newMap.put(....); newMap.put(....); } /* After the above synchronization block, everything that is in the HashMap is visible outside this thread */ /* Now make the updated set of values available to the consumer threads. As long as this write operation can complete without being interrupted, and is guaranteed to be written to shared memory, and the consumer can live with the out of date information temporarily, this should work fine */ currentMap = newMap;}public static Object getFromCurrentMap(Object key) { Map m = null; Object result = null; m = currentMap; // no locking around this is required if (m != null) { // should only be null during initialization Object result = m.get(key); // get on a HashMap is not synchronized // Do any additional processing needed using the result } return(result);}",Why would I place a synchronized block within a single-threaded method?
Handling in-app billing managed consumable products across sessions/devices?," My question is centered around handling in-app purchases for consumables with Google's In-App Billing API. (https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/api.html#consumetypes)Their documentation describes consumables as:Consumable productsIn contrast, you can implement consumption for products that can be made available for purchase multiple times. Typically, these products provide certain temporary effects. For example, the user's in-game character might gain life points or gain extra gold coins in their inventory. Dispensing the benefits or effects of the purchased product in your application is called provisioning the managed product. You are responsible for controlling and tracking how managed products are provisioned to the users.A consumable item is something that could be purchased several times (like in game currency, an in game item or upgrade that is used, etc.), whereas a non-consumable can only be purchased once (no-ads, a skin / character, etc.)In the documentation on consuming a purchase (https://developer.android.com/training/play-billing-library/purchase-iab-products.html), it also mentions:How you use the consumption mechanism in your app is up to you. Typically, you would implement consumption for products with temporary benefits that users may want to purchase multiple times, such as in-game currency or replenishable game tokens. You would typically not want to implement consumption for products that are purchased once and provide a permanent effect, such as a premium upgrade.It's your responsibility to control and track how the in-app product is provisioned to the user. For example, if the user purchased in-game currency, you should update the player's inventory with the amount of currency purchased.My question is how to keep track of user inventory for consumable products? The documentation and various videos seem to quickly gloss over this, basically saying the app must apply the effects of the consumable when it gets confirmation of a successful purchase. But that isn't really the full picture. What if a user signs out and signs back in with a different account? Or they switch to a new phone, they should have the product on that phone.You can't really save record of the purchase in SharedPreferences or a persistent cache because it is tied to the phone. If a user signs in on a different phone then they should have the benefits of all the purchases they made.Take the following example:A game starts players with 1000 gold. Player buys 500 more gold through an in-app purchase, then spends 200 gold. If player buys a new phone and installs that app on that phone, they should have 1300 gold.How is this normally accomplished?Do you need to run a private server that keeps track of purchases/consumption of such things separate from Google?Thanks!! <code> ",Handling in-app purchases / consumable products across sessions/devices?

Why Java 10 (18.3) type inference var can have variable of type void," With Java 10, we can use type inference. However, there is one thing which we couldn't do before: have variables of type void. So, in previous versions we simply couldn't define the variable type void. But now we can assign result of method returning void to the variable: The question is - why does it even compile, what purpose does it serve? Do you have any use case for this strange thing?Variable of type void has no methods, it cannot be even used as a parameter of a method. <code>  String s1 = ""hello""; // before Java 10var s2 = ""hello""; // now void emptyMethod() { }...void v1 = emptyMethod(); // won't compilevar v2 = emptyMethod(); // no problem at all",Can Java 10 type inference for local variables infer void?

Isolating a static singleton using class loaders," Disclaimer: This is probably not the best solution given the issue, but I'm curious how this implementation could be achieved.Problem I'm trying to deal with some legacy code which has a singleton defined like bellow: I do not have the ability to change this design and the class is used heavily throughout the code base. The values returned by this singleton can greatly change the functionality of the code. Eg: Right now if I want the code to take Path A, then I have to initialize LegacySingleton in a particular way. If I then want to take Path B I have to re-initialize the LegacySingleton. There is no way of handling requests in parallel which take different paths; meaning for each different configuration of LegacySingleton required I need to launch a separate JVM instance. My Question Is it possible to isolate this singleton using separate class loaders? I've been playing around with the ClassLoader API, but I cant quite figure it out.I'm imagining it would look something along the lines of this: ... <code>  public class LegacySingleton { private static Boolean value; public static void setup(boolean v) { if (value != null) { throw new RuntimeException(""Already Set up""); } value = v; System.out.println(""Setup complete""); } public static void teardown() { value = null; System.out.println(""Teardown complete""); } public static boolean getValue() { return value; }} public class LegacyRequestHandler { public void handleRequest() { if (LegacySingleton.getValue()) { System.out.println(""Path A""); } else { System.out.println(""Path B""); } }} public class LegacyRequestHandlerProvider extends Supplier<LegacyRequestHandler> { private final boolean value; public LegacyRequestHandlerProvider(boolean value) { this.value = value; } @Override public LegacyRequestHandler get() { LegacySingleton.setup(value); return new LegacyRequestHandler(); }} ClassLoader loader1 = new SomeFunkyClassLoaderMagic();Supplier<LegacyRequestHandler> supplier1 = loader1 .loadClass(""com.project.LegacyRequestHandlerProvider"") .getConstructor(Boolean.TYPE) .newInstance(true);ClassLoader loader2 = new SomeFunkyClassLoaderMagic();Supplier<LegacyRequestHandler> supplier2 = loader2 .loadClass(""com.project.LegacyRequestHandlerProvider"") .getConstructor(Boolean.TYPE) .newInstance(false);LegacyRequestHandler handler1 = supplier1.get();LegacyRequestHandler handler2 = supplier2.get();",Isolating a static singleton class using class loaders

jaxb2-maven-plugin reusing commons XSD within same project," I have a project which has a schema A and B, both within the same namespace. Both import schema C which also uses the same namespace. How can I generate JAXB classes for A and B to separate packages, while reusing the JAXB classes from C generated to a commons package?I already know I should probably be using episodes and use the episode generated for schema C as bindings file for the separate executions of schema's A and B. Problem is I don't know how to refer to this generated episode file.Here's an example: This causes an episode file to be created under: How do I refer to this episode/bindings file in executions for A and B? Using Episodes only mentions how to refer to an episode file from other jar dependencies (or I simply didn't understand it properly, which is more likely).I've seen an older answer suggest to pass it as a parameter -b to XJC, but that didn't seem to do anything for me. I still end up with the same class from C generated three times. <code>  <plugin> <groupId>org.jvnet.jaxb2.maven2</groupId> <artifactId>maven-jaxb2-plugin</artifactId> <version>0.12.3</version> <executions> <execution> <id>generate-sources-C</id> <goals> <goal>generate</goal> </goals> <configuration> <generatePackage>com.mymodel.commons</generatePackage> <generateDirectory>${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/xjc-commons</generateDirectory> <schemas> <schema><url>src/main/resources/xsd/mymodel/c.xsd</url></schema> </schemas> </configuration> </execution> <execution> <id>generate-sources-A</id> <goals> <goal>generate</goal> </goals> <configuration> <generatePackage>com.mymodel.a</generatePackage> <schemas> <schema><url>src/main/resources/xsd/mymodel/a.xsd</url></schema> </schemas> </configuration> </execution> <execution> <id>generate-sources-B</id> <goals> <goal>generate</goal> </goals> <configuration> <generatePackage>com.mymodel.b</generatePackage> <schemas> <schema><url>src/main/resources/xsd/mymodel/b.xsd</url></schema> </schemas> </configuration> </execution> </executions></plugin> target/generated-sources/xjc-commons/META-INF/sun-jaxb.episode",maven-jaxb2-plugin reusing commons XSD within same project

How to convert time 24-hour to AM/PM and remove nanoseconds & seconds?," I'm faced with the issue that I need to convert time from 24 format to AM/PM format (and vice-versa) removing redundant values such as nanoseconds and seconds by time4j library.I'm using the time4j library because Java can't handle Windows Time Zones and I have to convert them via time4jConversion from 24 hour format to AM/PM will depend on users localization. And I want to transmit it (localization) as an argument. Localization will look like ""en-US"" string.For example: If users localization is ""en-US"" then convert 24 hour format to AM/PM. Else keep current value.Or maybe it's better to get time in the format I need when I already define localization of my user?Any ideas how to do this? Please help)I have to spend a lot of time reading time4j doc but my mind is blownTo have full scale of what I'm doing and what the purpose all of this:I have to get users timeZone from my DB which corresponds to Windows Time Zones and convert them to IANA time zones. I already did this by this method Where ""userTimeZoneId"" is timeZone from DB. It corresponds to Microsoft Name of Time ZonesMy next step is to get time / or time stamp from users time zone which I already convert to IANA time zones.I did like this: Where ""winZone"" converted timeZone (eg. ""WINDOWS~Europe/Kiev"")So now returning to my problem I described at the top of the post.Maybe it's better to get time in the format I need when I already define localization of my user?How can I convert time from 24 format to AM/PM and vise-versa?How to remove redundant values such as nanoseconds and seconds?How can I use user localization in conversion? <code>  WindowsZone wzn = WindowsZone.of(userTimeZoneId); //userTimeZoneId=""eg. FLE Standart Time""TZID winZone = wzn.resolveSmart(new Locale("""",""001""));System.out.println(winZone.canonical()); // WINDOWS~Europe/Kiev PlainTime currentTime = SystemClock.inZonalView(winZone).now().toTime(); //currentTime: ""T17:31:37,057""",How to convert time 24-hour to AM/PM and remove nanoseconds & seconds via time4j?

Does Spring security by default use any password encoder while authenticating user?," I'm trying to learn Spring security currently. I used BCryptPasswordEncoder to encode user password before persisting into a databaseCode: Then used it during authentication as well and User was getting authenticated as expected. Then I removed .passwordEncoder(bCryptPasswordEncoder); from configure() method, still users with encoded password is getting authenticated successfully.Then I removed password encoder from both the saveUser() and the configure() method, and persisted a User into the database(i.e without password encoding) and tried to access an authenticated page but I got AccessedDeniedException, But users with encoded password still gets authenticated even though i removed passwordEncoder() from configure() method. Why is this happening?Does spring security by default use password encoder during authentication?If so how to use spring security without password encoding? <code>  @Override public void saveUser(User user) { user.setPassword(bCryptPasswordEncoder.encode(user.getPassword())); user.setActive(1); Role userRole = roleRepository.findByRole(""ADMIN""); user.setRoles(new HashSet<Role>(Arrays.asList(userRole))); userRepository.save(user); } @Override protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception { auth. jdbcAuthentication() .usersByUsernameQuery(usersQuery) .authoritiesByUsernameQuery(rolesQuery) .dataSource(dataSource).passwordEncoder(bCryptPasswordEncoder); }",How to use Spring security without password encoding?

Is there a way to know maximally reached JVM call stack size for a particular program run?," I've been coding one recursive function today and the recursion depth depends on the input length.I was wondering from the pure interest point of view, is there some way to monitor, probably in some JVM logs or elsewhere, what has been the maximal call stack depth during a particular program execution?After some thinking I can imagine an analytical approach to calculate this approximately but that would be very time-intensive and would require quite good knowledge of JVM internals and bytecode.

How do you wait for all asynchronous calls to complete in Java," Conceptually very simple. We have a huge legacy java site that uses NO threading / async. It takes forever to logon because it makes a dozen calls to different microservices, but all synchronously one at a time: each waits for the other to complete before making the next call. However NONE of the API calls depend on the result of any of the others.But we do need to have all the results and combine them before we proceed. It seemed really obvious that we should be able to make these dozen calls in parallel, but wait for them ALL to complete to use their data IN THE VERY NEXT STEP.So everything is synchronous before and after the calls. However it would be nice to send them each off on their own in parallel, asynchronously or just in parallel then we are only restricted by the single slowest call, not the total sequential times of all the calls.I read Java 8 has this great new set of operations around CompletableFuture. But I haven't found my use explained anywhere. We don't want the result to be a promise - we're happy to wait until they all complete and then continue. JS has Promise.all(), but even that returns a promise.All I can think of is to put a little wait look after the async calls are made, and only continue when we get all the results. Which is obviously nuts. Am I missing something here? Because it seems so obvious to me, but no one else seems to have a problem with it or else the approach is so simple no-one bothers to ask, and I'm just not getting it. <code> ",How do you wait for all asynchronous calls to complete in Java?

Should each docker image contain a jdk?," So, I'm very new to Docker. Let me explain the context to the question.I have 10 - 20 Spring Boot micro-service applications, each running on different ports on my local machine.But for migrating to Docker, based on my learning, each of the services must be in a different Docker container so as to quickly deploy or make copies.For each Docker container, we need to create a new Docker image.Each Docker image must contain a JRE for the Spring Boot application to run. It is around 200 MB maximum. That means each docker image is, say 350 MB at the maximum.On the other hand, on my local PC I have only one JRE of 200 MB and each application takes only a few MB of space.Based on this, I would need 600 MB on my local system, yet need 7 GB for all Docker images.Is this approach correct? Should ""OpenJDK"" from DockerHub be added to each image?Why is the size of the image large even if the target PC may already have the JDK? <code> ",Should each Docker image contain a JDK?

How can I not escape a WebTarget query parameter?," I want to turn off URL encoding for Jersey requests, or for certain parameters.The server I'm talking to requires the format of example.com/path?query=foo:barWith Jackson WebTarget, Sadly this produces example.com/path?query=foo bar which is not accepted by the server.I've searched a lot for this and the only promising avenue seems to be something to do with javax.ws.rs.core.Configuration, but I haven't gotten far with that yet. <code>  final WebTarget target = ClientBuilder.newClient() .target(url) .queryParam(""query"", ""{queryVal}"") .resolveTemplate(""queryVal"", ""foo:bar"");",How can I avoid escaping a WebTarget query parameter?

How to set TCP keep Alive in java from httpclient," My Java application which resides in AWS private subnet connects to an http server via AWS Nat gateway. I am calling a POST request via HttpClient to the HTTP server. That request will take more than 10 minutes to complete. I have configured a socket time out and connection timeout of 1 hour as this this a background task . But the intermediate AWS NAT gateway will send back a RST packet after 300 secs [5 mins] and cause the connection to get resetted , there is no way i can increase the NAT gateway timeout. So i need to handle the problem from my application side.My strategy is to use a TCP keep alive time which will send a packet say every 240 secs to keep the connection active. I have configured thisas below and then call the post request via execute method Since I am using a Linux system I have configured the server with following sysctl values: But while executing the program the keep alive is not enabled and connection fails as previous.I have checked this with netstat -o option and as shown below keep alive is off Is there any way i can set TCP keep alive from java code using httpclient . Also I can see HttpConnectionParams are deprecated. But I couldn't find any new class which can set keep alive <code>  CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault()HttpParams params = httpClient.getParams();HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeout(params, 3600000); //connection TimeoutHttpConnectionParams.setSoTimeout(params, 3600000); // Socket Time outHttpConnectionParams.setSoKeepalive(params, true); //Enable Socket level keep alive time HttpPost post = new HttpPost(""http://url"");HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(post); sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=240 sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=240sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes=10 tcp 0 0 192.168.1.141:43770 public_ip:80 ESTABLISHED 18134/java off (0.00/0/0)",How to set TCP keep Alive from HttpClient?
Java: How to describe a state with three items," I am creating the board game Tic Tac Toe in Java. A cell will have three states: empty, X or O.What is the best practice for representing this in Java? Should I create its own Cell class or just use integers (0/1/2) to represent the three states? If it had two states then I could use for example boolean to represent the two states, is there a similar already defined class for something with three states? <code> ",How to describe a state with three items

Modules from JDK should be used insteadOracle OpenJDK 11 doesn't support Linux Alpine, so lightweight images can't be easily createdIn the same time current stable Debian versions still doesn't have Java 11 packages (Ubuntu has Java 10 installed under openjdk-11 packages), that's why unstable sid versions are used for base docker imagescurrently available Oracle openjdk-11 images build unstripped libjvm.so module, which has hundreds megabyte and must be stripped separately:jlink runtime image size (specifically libjvm.so) created from openjdk is huge. Expected it to be much smaller.Solution: https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/issues/217#issuecomment-436079779As a result of these issues even slim Oracle Java 11 base images are quite heavy and considered to be unstable: https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/So the question is: what are optimized or recommended ways to build and deliver Java 11 applications as docker images? <code> ",Java 11 application as lightweight docker image

find a smaller group of friends from the cricle?," I am working on the following problem: In a room with people, we will define two persons are friends if they are directly or indirectly friends.

Deadlocks with java.util.concurrent._ in Scala," I came across the following scenario when studying the book ""Functional Programming in Scala"" by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjanarson (Ch. 7 - Purely functional parallelism). You can find the original code on Github here. See here for the java.util.concurrent documentation.I am concerned with the implementation of fork. In particular, allegedly fork can lead to deadlocks when the ThreadPool is too small.I consider the following example: I would not expect this example to end up in a deadlock as there are two threads. Yet, it does on my computer when I run it in the Scala REPL. Why is this so?The output when initializing the ExecutorService ises: java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService = Is pool size = 0 correct here? In other word, is this a problem of not understanding java.util.concurrent._ or is the issue with not understanding the Scala part? <code>  package fpinscala.parallelism import java.util.concurrent._ import language.implicitConversions object Par { type Par[A] = ExecutorService => Future[A] def run[A](s: ExecutorService)(a: Par[A]): Future[A] = a(s) def unit[A](a: A): Par[A] = (es: ExecutorService) => UnitFuture(a) // `unit` is represented as a function that returns a `UnitFuture`, which is a simple implementation of `Future` that just wraps a constant value. It doesn't use the `ExecutorService` at all. It's always done and can't be cancelled. Its `get` method simply returns the value that we gave it. private case class UnitFuture[A](get: A) extends Future[A] { def isDone = true def get(timeout: Long, units: TimeUnit) = get def isCancelled = false def cancel(evenIfRunning: Boolean): Boolean = false } def map2[A,B,C](a: Par[A], b: Par[B])(f: (A,B) => C): Par[C] = // `map2` doesn't evaluate the call to `f` in a separate logical thread, in accord with our design choice of having `fork` be the sole function in the API for controlling parallelism. We can always do `fork(map2(a,b)(f))` if we want the evaluation of `f` to occur in a separate thread. (es: ExecutorService) => { val af = a(es) val bf = b(es) UnitFuture(f(af.get, bf.get)) // This implementation of `map2` does _not_ respect timeouts. It simply passes the `ExecutorService` on to both `Par` values, waits for the results of the Futures `af` and `bf`, applies `f` to them, and wraps them in a `UnitFuture`. In order to respect timeouts, we'd need a new `Future` implementation that records the amount of time spent evaluating `af`, then subtracts that time from the available time allocated for evaluating `bf`. } def fork[A](a: => Par[A]): Par[A] = // This is the simplest and most natural implementation of `fork`, but there are some problems with it--for one, the outer `Callable` will block waiting for the ""inner"" task to complete. Since this blocking occupies a thread in our thread pool, or whatever resource backs the `ExecutorService`, this implies that we're losing out on some potential parallelism. Essentially, we're using two threads when one should suffice. This is a symptom of a more serious problem with the implementation, and we will discuss this later in the chapter. es => es.submit(new Callable[A] { def call = a(es).get }) def lazyUnit[A](a: => A): Par[A] = fork(unit(a)) def equal[A](e: ExecutorService)(p: Par[A], p2: Par[A]): Boolean = p(e).get == p2(e).get} val a = Par.lazyUnit(42 + 1)val es: ExecutorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2)println(Par.fork(a)(es).get) java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor@73a86d72[Running, pool size = 0, active threads = 0, queued tasks = 0, completed tasks = 0]",Deadlocks with java.util.concurrent._ in Scala in REPL

Does anyone know how to solve this problem?Edit :I want to prevent instanceOf keyword via Type Adapter Solution: @Micha Ziober's respond works for me.  <code>  { ""name"" : ""john doe"", ""isValid"" : true } { ""name"" : ""john doe"", ""isValid"" : 1 } class XModel{ private boolean isValid; ... ...} class BooleanJsonDeserializer implements JsonDeserializer<Boolean> { private final Set<String> TRUE_STRINGS = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(""true"", ""1"", ""yes"")); @Override public Boolean deserialize(JsonElement json, Type typeOfT, JsonDeserializationContext context) throws JsonParseException { System.out.println(json); JsonPrimitive jsonPrimitive = json.getAsJsonPrimitive(); if (jsonPrimitive.isBoolean()) { return jsonPrimitive.getAsBoolean(); } else if (jsonPrimitive.isNumber()) { return jsonPrimitive.getAsNumber().intValue() == 1; } else if (jsonPrimitive.isString()) { return TRUE_STRINGS.contains(jsonPrimitive.getAsString().toLowerCase()); } return false; }}",GSON converting Integer value to Boolean value dynamically for specific fields

How can I override JAX-RS parameter class in Swagger documentation?," ContextLet's say that I have a simple data class in Java: Note: in practice, I use Immutables to generate this, but am showing a POJO here for the sake of simplicity.To document the model of the GET response, even if the return type is Response, I can refer to the class in @ApiOperation: Based on that, Swagger will document this correctly: Model: Example value: To document the model of the POST body, I use the class directly in the code, Swagger finds it and documents it as desired: ProblemI want to support partial updates as well. I cannot use the POJO itself, because all fields are mandatory in the POJO, I rely on that to get safe checks and clear error messages when invalid JSON is sent to e.g. the POST method.In my actual use-case, my datamodel contains maps. I want users to be able to specify a certain key in the update and set the value to null, to delete elements from an existing maps.I chose to support PATCH requests where the body is typed as a plain JsonNode. That allows any JSON to be received by my server and I can apply the updates as I wish. I'm happy with the result, except that Swagger now documents the partial update's model with the properties of the JsonNode Java object: Model: Example value: I would like to specify in my code that the model is like Person, so that the example given in the Swagger UI is more relevant. I did try @ApiImplicitParams: That did not make any difference. Swagger still documents JsonNode itself. The documentation for @ApiImplicitParams mentions: While ApiParam is bound to a JAX-RS parameter, method or field, this allows you to manually define a parameter in a fine-tuned manner. This is the only way to define parameters when using Servlets or other non-JAX-RS environments.Since I am using JAX-RS, this might mean that I cannot use @ApiImplicitParams, but @ApiParam does not provide anything to override the class.How can I specify manually the datamodel of a JAX-RS parameter that is detected by Swagger automatically? <code>  public class Person { private final String name; private final int age; Person(String name, int age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } public String getName() { return name; } int String getAge() { return age; }} @GET@ApiOperation(response = Person.class)public Response getPerson() { return Response.ok(new Person(""Julien"", 28)).build();} Person { name (string), age (number)} { ""name"": ""string"", ""age"": 0} @POST@ApiOperation(response = Person.class)public Response addPerson(Person newPerson) { return Response.ok(store.insert(newPerson)).build();} @PATCH@Path(""/{name}"")@ApiOperation(response = Person.class)public Response updatePerson(@PathParam(""name"") String name, JsonNode update) { return Response.ok(store.update(name, update)).build();} JsonNode { array (boolean, optional), null (boolean, optional), number (boolean, optional), float (boolean, optional), pojo (boolean, optional), valueNode (boolean, optional), containerNode (boolean, optional), object (boolean, optional), missingNode (boolean, optional), nodeType (string, optional) = ['ARRAY', 'BINARY', 'BOOLEAN', 'MISSING', 'NULL', 'NUMBER', 'OBJECT', 'POJO', 'STRING'], integralNumber (boolean, optional), floatingPointNumber (boolean, optional), short (boolean, optional), int (boolean, optional), long (boolean, optional), double (boolean, optional), bigDecimal (boolean, optional), bigInteger (boolean, optional), textual (boolean, optional), boolean (boolean, optional), binary (boolean, optional)} { ""array"": true, ""null"": true, ""number"": true, ""float"": true, ""pojo"": true, ""valueNode"": true, ""containerNode"": true, ""object"": true, ""missingNode"": true, ""nodeType"": ""ARRAY"", ""integralNumber"": true, ""floatingPointNumber"": true, ""short"": true, ""int"": true, ""long"": true, ""double"": true, ""bigDecimal"": true, ""bigInteger"": true, ""textual"": true, ""boolean"": true, ""binary"": true} @PATCH@Path(""/{name}"")@ApiOperation(response = Person.class)@ApiImplicitParams({ @ApiImplicitParam(name = ""update"", dataTypeClass = Person.class)})public Response updatePerson(@PathParam(""name"") String name, JsonNode update) { return Response.ok(store.update(name, update)).build();}",How can I manually document Swagger datamodel for a JAX-RS parameter?

What's the safest way to store private keys in Android applications that open SSH connections?," I'm writing an app which is supposed to access my private server via SSH using JSch. Since I have set up public key authentication I want this app to authenticate the same way. I will be the only one using this app so I want to store my key either directly inside the app (e.g. hard-coded) or separated somewhere inside the home directory of my phone. Which would be the best way to store it, maybe as a resource file inside the project? Since I'm pretty new to Android development I'm not sure about what's the best way for this.What I've tried: Another way: The latter resulted in an ""invalid privatekey"" error. Besides that, I'm not sure which of both is the more secure way to work with.Thanks in advance. <code>  // [...]String user = ""my_user"";String ssh_pwd = ""my_pwd"";String host = ""my_host"";// stored as OpenSSH key - file not found error - where shoud I move this file?String private_key = ""./my_pk"";int port = 22;// basic SSH connection stuffJSch jsch = new JSch();session = jsch.getSession(user, host, port);jsch.addIdentity(private_key, ssh_pwd.getBytes()); // [...]// private key in OpenSSH format as a plain stringString private_key = ""xyz123abc456def789ghi012...""; // public key in OpenSSH format as a plain stringString public_key = ""a1b2c3d4e5...""; // [...]jsch.addIdentity(""id_rsa"", private_key.getBytes(), public_key.getBytes(), ssh_pwd.getBytes());",Loading private key from string or resource in Java JSch in Android app

How to generate JSON schema object type with dynamic key names?," Say I have following json: Now there could be multiple objects like above, so I want to reference above schema which can be generated from https://www.jsonschema.net, but I want to have the empName as object keys and above as value, so it will be an object with multiple unique keys (empName) and the value will be referencing above schema. Consider below example, when the POJO is serialized to JSON by Jackson, it should be like below: What should be the overall schema for this scenario (the JSON schema)? Ultimately, jackson will be used to generate the POJO for this schema and used in the REST APIs that I have created.EDIT: (trying to clarify)Imagine a List<Map<k, v>> as my data. I want to have json schema for this whose output json will have the keys as the object names, like above json example.Solution: Mushif's comment to this question is the answer.

Why Oracle claims java.util.Random.nextFloat() generates 2^24 possibilities and not 2^23?," According to the documentation for java.util.Random, the Java class implements nextFloat by next(24) / ((float)(1 << 24)) (ie. a random non-negative integer with 24 bits divided by 224). The documentation claims that all 224 possible values can be returned. They are between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). However, I don't think that is true. First, note that according to the IEC 559 (IEEE 754) standard, float has 23 fraction bits. But there is an implicit leading bit (to the left of the binary point) with value 1, unless the exponent is stored with all zeros. Therefore, it is true that there are a total of 224 values of type float that are between 0 (inclusive - not counting negative zero) and 1 (exclusive), but exactly half of these numbers are subnormal (all bits in the exponent are 0), which makes them all less than 2-126. Therefore, none of these numbers can be generated by the implementation. This is because they are all strictly smaller than 2-24 which is used in the implementation.The layout of float can be found at Single-precision floating-point format.So what is it that I am missing? <code> ",Why does Oracle claim java.util.Random.nextFloat() generates 2^24 possibilities and not 2^23?
How to perform an action only if the Mono is empty and throw an error it not empty," I'm trying to convert a project to use Spring WebFlux and am running into a problem getting some basic business logic working.

Is exposing static methods in abstract classes considered good or bad practice," I recently came across some code where a public static method was defined inside an abstract class. I am wondering whether this is considered good practice or an anti-pattern?I've produced a simple example program to illustrate what I mean. When you run the code you get the result of 5 which proves that I was able to run code inside of an abstract class.I've deliberately not added extends to StaticMethodsInClassesStudy to emphasise the point that it's perfectly possible to run code directly inside an abstract class without instantiating an extending class. Personally I would have thought that this is bad practice since you're using an abstract class as a normal Class and thereby bypassing the intent of abstract classes. Shouldn't these kinds of methods be kept in separate ""normal"" java classes e.g. utility classes ? <code>  public abstract class StaticMethodsInAbstractClassesStudy { public static int adder(int a, int b){ return a + b; }}public class StaticMethodsInClassesStudy { public static void main(String [] args){ System.out.println(StaticMethodsInAbstractClassesStudy.adder(2, 3)); }}",Is exposing static methods in abstract classes considered good or bad practice

Why variable is effectively final when using for-each?," case 1: it can work when using for-each loop or case 2: it will catch compile-time error In case 2, I know the variable i is not effectively final because its value changed between loop iterations.

Why java.lang.Enum::valueOf doesn't check for the null name first?," I have checked the source code for java.lang.Enum and the method T valueOf(Class<T> enumType, String name) beginning on line 232 (the implementation in both java-8 and java-11 seems equal; here is the source for Java 8). What is the reason the null check for name happens after finding the enumeration by name in the Map get using enumConstantDirectory()? As far as I know, one cannot define a null enum; therefore the following call makes no sense: Although the HashMap implementation allows null as a key, I would expect the implementation would check for null before iterating the Map. What is the reason for this implementation and is there a case where searching for the null key before comparing name == null makes sense? <code>  public static <T extends Enum<T>> T valueOf(Class<T> enumType, String name) { T result = enumType.enumConstantDirectory().get(name); if (result != null) return result; if (name == null) throw new NullPointerException(""Name is null""); throw new IllegalArgumentException( ""No enum constant "" + enumType.getCanonicalName() + ""."" + name);} MyEnum myEnum = Enum.valueOf(MyEnum.class, null); // The NPE should be thrown",Why doesn't java.lang.Enum::valueOf check for the null name first?

Why @Transactional isolation level has no effect when updating entities with Spring Data JPA?," For this experimental project based on the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency and H2 in-memory database, I defined a User entity with two fields (id and firstName) and declared a UsersRepository by extending the CrudRepository interface.Now, consider a simple controller which provides two endpoints: /print-user reads the same user twice with some interval printing out its first name, and /update-user is used to change the user's first name in between those two reads. Notice that I deliberately set Isolation.READ_COMMITTED level and expected that during the course of the first transaction, a user which is retrieved twice by the same id will have different names. But instead, the first transaction prints out the same value twice. To make it more clear, this is the complete sequence of actions:Initially, jeremy's first name is set to Jeremy.Then I call /print-user which prints out Jeremy and goes to sleep.Next, I call /update-user from another session and it changes jeremy's first name to Bob.Finally, when the first transaction gets awakened after sleep and re-reads the jeremy user, it prints out Jeremy again as his first name even though the first name has already been changed to Bob (and if we open the database console, it's now indeed stored as Bob, not Jeremy).It seems like setting isolation level has no effect here and I'm curious why this is so. <code>  @RestController@RequestMappingpublic class UsersController { private final UsersRepository usersRepository; @Autowired public UsersController(UsersRepository usersRepository) { this.usersRepository = usersRepository; } @GetMapping(""/print-user"") @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK) @Transactional (isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED) public void printName() throws InterruptedException { User user1 = usersRepository.findById(""jeremy""); System.out.println(user1.getFirstName()); // allow changing user's name from another // session by calling /update-user endpoint Thread.sleep(5000); User user2 = usersRepository.findById(""jeremy""); System.out.println(user2.getFirstName()); } @GetMapping(""/update-user"") @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK) @Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED) public User changeName() { User user = usersRepository.findById(""jeremy""); user.setFirstName(""Bob""); return user; } }",Why does @Transactional isolation level have no effect when updating entities with Spring Data JPA?

Run C++ code in Java Android app using JavaCPP: couldn't find libjnijavacpp.so," I a beginner when it comes to development for Android and I am trying to understand JavaCPP. I want to execute a C++ function from Java inside an Android application. In my example I just use a simple TextView widget that prints what I receive from C++.Following the documentation, inside the app's build.gradle I have included my javacpp library dependencies in order to use it in my app. I am testing inside a Native C++ Android Studio template project.I have uploaded the full project on GitHub for reference: https://github.com/jacobkrieg10/javacppnewexampleAnd also, down are the relevant files in the project that I think need attention:NativeLibrary.java: NativeLibrary.h: NativeLibrary.cpp: CMakeLists.txt: Note that native-lib.cpp is just the C++ file used in the template, I am ignoring it for now.build.gradle (corresponding to the app module): MainActivity.java: The application builds fine, but it crashes at runtime inside NativeLibrary.NativeClass l = new NativeLibrary.NativeClass();, with the message couldn't find ""libjniNativeLibrary.so"" this is my crash log: Note that the example is working when I execute it on desktop x64. So, e.g., using the following NativeLibrary.java file: the output of is Hello World! so it works fine. But I don't know why it doesn't work inside an Android app.Can anybody help me with this? Does anybody know why it couldn't find libjniNativeLibrary.so? Is there something I need to add in order to complete the setup? Perhaps libjniNativeLibrary.so needs to be generated somehow?EDIT 1:I have added the Build Plugin and the Platform Plugin to the project's build.gradle file; this is how it looks like now: The project synchronizes without errors but when I run it, I get: Is it beacause I didn't write anything inside javacppBuildCommand, javacppBuildParser and javacppBuildParser?I know this is a basic question, but does anyone know what exactly I should write inside those blocks? I'm quite new to this and I don't know exactly where to look for this information.EDIT 2:After trying the solution presented in EDIT 1, above, I came across A guide on how to run Javacpp on Android studio together with gradle wiki page and as instructed there I have added this to my app's build.gradle file: The gradle sync runs ok but when I build the project I get: Any idea how I can solve this? <code>  dependencies { implementation 'org.bytedeco:javacpp:1.5.4'} package com.example.javacplusplus;import org.bytedeco.javacpp.*;import org.bytedeco.javacpp.annotation.*;@Platform(include=""NativeLibrary.h"")@Namespace(""NativeLibrary"")public class NativeLibrary { public static class NativeClass extends Pointer { static { Loader.load(); } public NativeClass() { allocate(); } private native void allocate(); // to call the getter and setter functions public native @StdString String get_property(); public native void set_property(String property); // to access the member variable directly public native @StdString String property(); public native void property(String property); }} #ifndef NATIVELIBRARY_H#define NATIVELIBRARY_H#include <string>namespace NativeLibrary { class NativeClass { public: const std::string& get_property(); void set_property(const std::string& property); std::string property; };}#endif // NATIVELIBRARY_H #include ""NativeLibrary.h""namespace NativeLibrary {const std::string& NativeClass::get_property() { return property; }void NativeClass::set_property(const std::string& property) { this->property = property; }} // namespace NativeLibrary cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.1)add_library( native-lib SHARED NativeLibrary.cpp native-lib.cpp)find_library( log-lib log)target_link_libraries( native-lib ${log-lib}) apply plugin: 'com.android.application'android { compileSdkVersion 29 buildToolsVersion ""29.0.3"" defaultConfig { applicationId ""com.example.javacplusplus"" minSdkVersion 28 targetSdkVersion 29 versionCode 1 versionName ""1.0"" testInstrumentationRunner ""androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"" externalNativeBuild { cmake { cppFlags """" } } } buildTypes { release { minifyEnabled false proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro' } } externalNativeBuild { cmake { path ""src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt"" version ""3.10.2"" } }}dependencies { implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar']) implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0' implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.0.4' implementation 'org.bytedeco:javacpp:1.5.4' testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12' androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test:runner:1.3.0' androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.3.0'} package com.example.javacplusplus;import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;import android.os.Bundle;import android.widget.TextView;public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { // Used to load the 'native-lib' library on application startup. static { System.loadLibrary(""native-lib""); } @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); // Pointer objects allocated in Java get deallocated once they become unreachable, // but C++ destructors can still be called in a timely fashion with Pointer.deallocate() NativeLibrary.NativeClass l = new NativeLibrary.NativeClass(); l.set_property(""Hello World!""); // Example of a call to a native method TextView tv = findViewById(R.id.sample_text); tv.setText(l.property());// tv.setText(stringFromJNI()); } /** * A native method that is implemented by the 'native-lib' native library, * which is packaged with this application. */ public native String stringFromJNI();} --------- beginning of crash2020-11-16 00:57:38.557 13506-13506/?

How to draw pixelized shapes (conceptional)," I would like to daw shapes in a pixelized style.My cirlce currently drawn with shaperenderer renders in real pixels.but i like it to be more pixelized.I played around with camera and viewport to get the effect, but not succeeded. I prefer to use FillViewport.Do we need create our own drawLine funtion and draw small squares along a line?Or can this be done with Viewports whith keeping the aspect ratio?Is there any small sample project that shows how to create simple shapes that are pixelized.I know I can code myself, but I would like to avoid when using a framework.In skretch you can draw a line an just specify the pixelsize, so easy.Any hints? <code>  public class SimpleCirleActor extends Actor { ShapeRenderer renderer; float radius; public SimpleCirleActor(int x , int y, float radius) { setBounds(0,0, Constants.pixelsPerSector(),Constants.pixelsPerSector()); this.radius = radius; setX(x);setY(y); renderer = new ShapeRenderer(); } @Override public void draw(Batch batch, float parentAlpha) { super.draw(batch, parentAlpha); renderer.setProjectionMatrix(getStage().getCamera().combined); renderer.begin(ShapeRenderer.ShapeType.Line); renderer.setColor(Color.CYAN); float x = getX(); renderer.circle(x, getY(), radius); renderer.end(); } @Override public void act(float delta) { super.act(delta); }}",How to draw pixelized shapes (LIBGDX conceptional)

Why is this allowed in the newer version? <code>  public class OuterClass { class InnerClass { static void printMe() { System.out.println(""Inside inner class""); } } public static void main(String[] args) { InnerClass.printMe(); }}",Why are static methods allowed inside a non-static inner class in Java 16?

Java 17: Is it legal to use `record` as a variable name even though it's a keyword?," This came as a surprise: I am able to declare a variable with the name record even though it now has become a keyword. Have a look at this: When compiled and run with Java 17 this gives: I had expected this to result in an error as is the case when trying to declare a variable named class. As I know the Java guys, they are extremely careful not to break existing code, and so I think this might be a deliberate choice.(You can't even declare a variable named const because that one const is a keyword in Java.) <code>  public class Main { static class Foo { void bar() { System.out.println(""Foo.bar""); } } record R (int a) {} public static void main(String[] args) { Foo record = new Foo(); record.bar(); R r = new R(5); System.out.println(r); }} Foo.barR[a=5]",Is it legal to use `record` as a variable name even though it's a keyword?

Code Reuse: Returning Lists of Enum Fields with Common Getter Methods," I have two enums:Main Menu Options Host Selection Method Options Both enums share the same field The same getter And the same asListString() method How can I DRY out these enums?I expect to have more enums with the same fields and methods, and it seems silly to write out the same thing over and over again for each one.I tried making both of the enums extend a superclass, but enums cannot have extends clausesI can create an interface that specifies the contract for the asListString() method, but that doesn't allow me to actually reuse any code.The flavor I was hoping the code could have is something like this: <code>  public enum MainMenuOptions { EXIT(""Exit""), VIEW_RESERVATIONS(""View Reservations By Host""), CREATE_RESERVATION(""Create A Reservation""), EDIT_RESERVATION(""Edit A Reservation""), CANCEL_RESERVATION(""Cancel A Reservation""); private final String message; MainMenuOptions(String message) { this.message = message; } public String getMessage() { return message; } public static List<String> asListString() { return Arrays.stream(MainMenuOptions.values()) .map(MainMenuOptions::getMessage) .collect(Collectors.toList()); }} public enum HostSelectionMethodOptions { FIND_ALL(""Find all""), FIND_BY_LASTNAME_PREFIX(""Find by last name prefix""), FIND_BY_CITY_STATE(""Find by city & state""); String message; HostSelectionMethod(String message) { this.message = message; } public String getMessage() { return message; } public static List<String> asListString() { return Arrays.stream(HostSelectionMethod.values()) .map(HostSelectionMethod::getMessage) .collect(Collectors.toList()); }} private final String message; public String getMessage() { return message;} public static List<String> asListString() { return Arrays.stream(MainMenuOptions.values()) .map(MainMenuOptions::getMessage) .collect(Collectors.toList());} public class Utils { public static List<String> enumAsListString(Enum e) { return e.values().stream.map(e::getMessage).collect(Collectors.toList()); }}",Code reuse: returning lists of enum fields with common getter methods
