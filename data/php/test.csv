Ajax polling.," In the project I am currently working on, we have the need to develop a web chat application, not a very complex chat, just a way to connect two people to talk about a very specific topic, we don't need any kind of authentication for one of the two users, we don't have to support emoticons, avatars, or stuff like that.Some project members suggested that we could use XMPP through BOSH, I said that is like trying to catch a fish with a boat's net, and proposed a simpler method, like a simple Ajax/MySQL web chat, but we're worried about the performance hit in the server because of the constant polling of many chats open at the same time.Has anyone done something like this before?

How to change envelope from adress using PHP mail?," I am using PHP with Apache on Linux, with Sendmail. I use the PHP mail function. The email is sent, but the envelope has the Apache_user@localhostname in MAIL FROM (example nobody@conniptin.internal) and some remote mail servers reject this because the domain doesn't exist (obviously). Using mail, can I force it to change the envelope MAIL FROM?EDIT: If I add a header in the fourth field of the mail() function, that changes the From field in the headers of the body of the message, and DOES NOT change the envelope MAIL FROM.I can force it by spawning sendmail with sendmail -t -odb -oi -frealname@realhost and piping the email contents to it.

PHP session problem *only in IE* *(??? really strange problem)," I have a site made with php which uses server side sessions throughout the site.In fact, it's a site with a user login which depends on session variables and if there were a problem with all session variables, no pages would load at all. On the site, there's an iframe that holds a feed of little messages from other users.Those little messages have clickable photos next to them that open the user's profile.Now, each page requires some formatting to open the user's profile on that specific page...there's really only a few problem pages, but those pages have to have the onclick functions formatted a little differently or they break the page.So I set a session variable on each page ($_SESSION[""current_page""]) that lets the feed know how to format the clickable photos. Now Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari all work as they are supposed to.But IE6 and IE7 are having problems on the pages that require special formatting.So after pulling my hair out a bit, I eventually got around to printing my session variables form the server.And lo and behold, on the special pages, ($_SESSION[""current_page""]) is always set to ""main"" instead of ""special1"" or ""special2"". I printed the same session variable in Firefox and all the other browsers I mentioned and they print out ""special1"" or ""special2"" as they're supposed to.Can anyone think of something - possibly related to the fact that the feed is in an iframe??? - that would cause IE to treat server side session variables differently or somehow launch page ""main"" silently in the background?I have checked the feed very carefully for any reference to page ""main"" - it doesn't seem like there's any ways it's loading that page. this doesn't make sense to me.  <code> ",PHP session doesn't work with IE

When displaying the data, use htmlentities(), is that what you all mean??Summarize:mysql_real_escape_string used when insert into databasehtmlentities() used when outputting data into webpagehtmlspecialchars() used when?strip_tags() used when?addslashes() used when?Can somebody fill in the question mark? <code>  $var = mysql_real_escape_string(htmlentities($_POST['username']));",How to prevent code injection attacks in PHP?
Des this mean I don't need htmlentities() or htmlspecialchars() in prepared statements?," In an article http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/4.1/prepared-statements.html, it says the followings:There are numerous advantages to using prepared statements in your applications, both for security and performance reasons.Prepared statements can help increase security by separating SQL logic from the data being supplied. This separation of logic and data can help prevent a very common type of vulnerability called an SQL injection attack.Normally when you are dealing with an ad hoc query, you need to be very careful when handling the data that you received from the user. This entails using functions that escape all of the necessary trouble characters, such as the single quote, double quote, and backslash characters.This is unnecessary when dealing with prepared statements. The separation of the data allows MySQL to automatically take into account these characters and they do not need to be escaped using any special function.Does this mean I don't need htmlentities() or htmlspecialchars()?But I assume I need to add strip_tags() to user input data?Am I right? <code> ",Do I need htmlentities() or htmlspecialchars() in prepared statements?

try and catch php warning," I need to catch some warnings being thrown from some php native functions and then handle them.Specifically: It throws a warning when the DNS query fails.try/catch doesn't work because a warning is not an exception.I now have 2 options:set_error_handler seems like overkill because I have to use it to filter every warning in the page (is this true?);Adjust error reporting/display so these warnings don't get echoed to screen, then check the return value; if it's false, no records is found for hostname.What's the best practice here? <code>  array dns_get_record ( string $hostname [, int $type= DNS_ANY [, array &$authns [, array &$addtl ]]] )",Can I try/catch a warning?

Finiding Zip Codes in a Specific Radius," I have found this popular PHP/MySQL Script called Zip Location by SaniSoft and it works great besides one thing: It doesn't in some instances.It seems that any radius under 20 miles returns the same amount of zip codes as 20 miles. I have searched all over google, but to no avail and I was wondering if someone had some insight on this situation.I would rather figure out this problem before having to pay for a program, and I could also use the learning experience. The database is a list of zip codes and longitudes and latitudes of each zip code. The script uses a method that determines the distance around the zip code entered and returns the zip codes in that radius based on their lon/lat.Thank you!!Edit:From using the distance function that the script provides I have discovered that the distance between the Zip Codes that the program gives me and my zip code are coming up as 0 miles.MAJOR UPDATEFrom research it turns out that the database has duplicate lat/lon values. Please be aware of this when using Zip Locator. Although the PHP does its job, you will need to find a new Database of zip codes. I will post my findings at a later date. <code> ",Finding Zip Codes in a Specific Radius

How to specify the parent query field from within a subquery in mySQL?," How do I specify the parent query field from within a subquery in MySQL?For Example:I have written a basic Bulletin Board type program in PHP.In the database each post contains: id(PK) and parent_id(the id of the parent post). If the post is itself a parent, then its parent_id is set to 0.I am trying to write a mySQL query that will find every parent post and the number of children that the parent has. The tricky part is that the first id doesn't know that it should be referring to the second id that is outside of the subquery. I know that I can do SELECT id AS id_tmp and then refer to it inside the subquery, but then if I want to also return the id and keep ""id"" as the column name, then I'd have to do a query that returns me 2 columns with the same data (which seems messy to me) The messy way works fine, but I feel an opportunity to learn something here so I thought I'd post the question. <code>  $query = ""SELECT id, ( SELECT COUNT(1) FROM post_table WHERE parent_id = id) as num_childrenFROM post_tableWHERE parent_id = 0""; $query = ""SELECT id, id AS id_tmp, (SELECT COUNT(1) FROM post_table WHERE parent_id = id_tmp) as num_children FROM post_table WHERE parent_id = 0"";",How to specify the parent query field from within a subquery in MySQL?

End my urls with trailing slash (/) or not? And how do I go about it doing this with codeigniter..," I am trying to figure out which is most appropriate. From the articles I have read, it seems best to end url's with a trailing slash.So instead of:http://example.url/articleIt would read:http://example.url/article/First I adjusted my htaccess to force a trailing slash. Then I started implementing this in my links and I thought if I did anchor('article/','article') it would work, but it seems that this function strips the trailing slash.To get around this I changed the config file to have $config['url_suffix'] = '/'. Which worked mostly fine - except I have a document area on my site with pdf's and such. So the links created there would turn out like http://example.url/documents/doc1.pdf/ . This of course does not work.What do you think my solution is here? I guess I could go back to any page I referenced documents or files in and adjust them to not use the anchor function, but I feel like there should be an easier way. <code>  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-fRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^.+[^/]$RewriteRule ^(.+)$ $1/ ",End my urls with trailing slash (/) or not?

How to use stdin and stdout stream wrappers via the command line from PHP," I am trying to write a PHP script that uses the pdftk app to merge an XFDF with a PDF form and output the merged PDF to the user. According to the pdftk documentation, I can pass the form data in via stdin and have the PDF output to the stdout stream. The normal, file-not-stream way to use pdftk from the command line is: to use streams on the command line, you'd enter: I have a couple of problems:1) I have gotten pdftk to return output via stdout using an xfdf file (instead of stdin) like so: But the pdf that it creates is corrupt, according to Adobe Reader and a quick peek at the file with a text editor shows that, at the very least, it is not setting the line endings where they should be. I have an identical PDF created by pdftk where it output to a file, and the pdf looks fine in the text editor, so I know that it's not pdftk that's outputting bad data.2) I can not for the life of me figure out how to set the stdin stream in PHP so that I can use that stream as my input for pdftk. From what I'm reading on the PHP documentation, stdin is read-only, so how does anything ever get into that stream?Ideally, I would like to keep this really simple and avoid using proc_open(). I attempted to use that function and wasn't very sucessful, which is probably my fault, not the function's, but really my goals are simple enough I'd rather avoid using robust functions I don't need.Ideally my code would look something like: Just a heads up, it is possible to put the actual xml string in the command line, but I've had very unreliable results with this.EditWith much help, I now understand that my real question was ""how can pipe a variable to a command line execution in PHP"". Apparently proc_open is the best way to go, or at least the most straightforward. Since it took me forever to figure this out and since my research on Google suggests others may be struggling, I'll post the code that specifically worked for my problem: <code>  pdftk blankform.pdf fill_form formdata.xfdf output filledform.pdf pdftk blankform.pdf fill_form - output - exec(""pdftk blankform.pdf fill_form formdata.xfdf output -"", $pdf_output); file_put_contents(""filledform.pdf"",$pdf_output); $form_data_raw = $_POST; $form_data_xfdf = raw2xfdf($form_data_raw); //some function that turns HTML-form data to XFDF $blank_pdf_form = ""blankform.pdf""; header('Content-type: application/pdf'); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""output.pdf""'); passthru(""pdftk $blank_pdf_form fill_form $form_data_xfdf output -); $blank_pdf_form = ""blankform.pdf"";$cmd = ""pdftk $blank_pdf_form fill_form - output -"";$descriptorspec = array( 0 => array(""pipe"", ""r""), 1 => array(""pipe"", ""w""));$process = proc_open($cmd, $descriptorspec, $pipes);if (is_resource($process)) { //row2xfdf is made-up function that turns HTML-form data to XFDF fwrite($pipes[0], raw2xfdf($_POST)); fclose($pipes[0]); $pdf_content = stream_get_contents($pipes[1]); fclose($pipes[1]); $return_value = proc_close($process); header('Content-type: application/pdf'); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""output.pdf""'); echo $pdf_content;}",How to pass variables as stdin into command line from PHP

How does PHP PDO works internally ?," I want to use pdo in my application, but before that I want to understand how internally PDOStatement->fetch and PDOStatement->fetchAll. For my application, I want to do something like ""SELECT * FROM myTable"" and insert into csv file and it has around 90000 rows of data. My question is, if I use PDOStatement->fetch as I am using it here: Will after every fetch from database, result for that fetch would be store in memory ?Meaning when I do second fetch, memory would have data of first fetch as well as data for second fetch.And so if I have 90000 rows of data and if am doing fetch every time than memory is being updated to take new fetch result without removing results from previous fetch and so for the last fetch memory would already have 89999 rows of data. Is this how PDOStatement::fetchworks ?Performance wise how does this stackup against PDOStatement::fetchAll ?Update: Something about fetch and fetchAll from memory usage point of viewJust wanted to added some thing to this question as recently found something regarding fetch and fetchAll, hope this would make this question worthwhile for people would visit this question in future to get some understanding on fetch and fetchAll parameters. fetch does not store information in memory and it works on row to row basis, so it would go through the result set and return row 1, than again would go to the result set and than again return row 2 mind here that it will not return row 1 as well as 2 but would only return row 2, so fetch will not store anything into memory but fetchAll will store details into the memories. So fetch is better option compared to fetchAll if we are dealing with an resultant set of around 100K in size.  <code>  // First, prepare the statement, using placeholders$query = ""SELECT * FROM tableName"";$stmt = $this->connection->prepare($query);// Execute the statement$stmt->execute();var_dump($stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC));while ($row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {echo ""Hi"";// Export every row to a filefputcsv($data, $row);}",How does PHP PDO work internally ?

How to catch a division by zero?," I have a large mathematical expression that has to be created dynamically. For example, once I have parsed ""something"" the result will be a string like: ""$foo+$bar/$baz"";.So, for calculating the result of that expression I'm using the eval function... something like this: The problem here is that sometimes I get errors that says there was a division by zero, and I don't know how to catch that Exception. I have tried things like: Or: But it does not work. So, how can I avoid that my application crashes when there is a division by zero?Edit:First, I want to clarify something: the expression is built dynamically, so I can't just eval if the denominator is zero. So... with regards to the Mark Baker's comment, let me give you an example. My parser could build something like this: The parser build the string step by step without worrying about the value of the vars... so in this case if $foz == $bak there's in fact a division by zero: $baz / ( 0 ).On the other hand as Pete suggested, I tried: But it does not print anything. <code>  eval(""\$result = $expresion;"");echo ""The result is: $result""; eval(""try{\$result = $expresion;}catch(Exception \$e){\$result = 0;}"");echo ""The result is: $result""; try{ eval(""\$result = $expresion;"");}catch(Exception $e){ $result = 0;}echo ""The result is: $result""; ""$foo + $bar * ( $baz / ( $foz - $bak ) )"" <?php$a = 5;$b = 0;if(@eval("" try{ \$res = $a/$b; } catch(Exception \$e){}"") === FALSE) $res = 0;echo ""$res\n"";?> ","PHP, How to catch a division by zero?"

PHP file rename.," I have a form where an admin will upload three pictures with different dimensions to three different designated directories. now to make sure that i don't get into the problem of duplicate file names i implemented something like the php will compare the uploaded file name and it will check if that file name exist in the designated directory if yes then it will echo an error and stop the script execution.Now one of my friend suggested me that it is very bad asking the admin to manually rename the picture file and asking them to take care of the file duplication problem. the solution he suggested was to rename the file automatically and then store it in the database and then direct it to directory.I am confused about what combination should i give to the renamed file and also make sure it will remain unique file name to be more precise i would like you to understand my directory structureas i said there will be three pictures files the admin will be uploading namely a) Title Picture b) Brief Picture c) Detail Pictureand all the three picture files will be moved to the different respective directory, like title picture goes to title directory and so on. i am using to script below currently just to move and store the file name with path using varchar in the database. that is just the sample code i havent included the validation function which i am using. i was thinking like i want to rename all the files likea) In title directory the file should be stored as.title_1.jpgtitle_2.jpgtitle_3.jpgtitle_4.jpgand so onand the same way to rest of the pictures. how do i do that? what function do i use to achieve my target. and if this is not the good way to rename the file i would appreciate any suggestion followed to rename the file.thanks in advance <code>  $ns_pic_title_loc= $_FILES[""ns_pic_title""][""tmp_name""];$ns_pic_title_name = $_FILES[""ns_pic_title""][""name""];move_uploaded_file($ns_pic_title_loc, $ns_title_target.$ns_pic_title_name) or die(mysql_error());",PHP file rename

How do targeted adds work with web bugs?," We got pitched this idea yesterday. A user visits our site and are marked. Then when they visit other sites like CNN they are targeted with adds for our site. So once they are exposed to us, they start to see us everywhere, creating the illusion we are bigger than we are. The person pitching it said it was done by cookies. I was very skeptical since I don't believe there to be anyway to see what cookies a different domain has set. So I wanted to try an figure out how it was accomplished. The salesman called this technology pixel tracking. I have never heard of pixel tracking but from my research I have found that it is placing a 1 pixel image that references a script on another domain with parameters to be executed. My first thought was, OK maybe its possible this way.. But I still don't know how?Can anyone explain how they are able to mark you as visited our site, and then see this mark on another site?

recommendation? for our specific HTML -> PDF project," I have a question which I see from googling has been discussed at length.. but I want to know what you would recommend based on our particular needs. I want to be on the right track before I find out a-week-of-work later that I chose the wrong tool (a tool which works, but whose peculiarity, in the end, would rule it out for our project).I read some good threads on Stack Overflow already on this topic.. but they have people making recommendations all over the map.. as I would expect - generally, our needs and experiences are all over the map. And again, here I want to know what you would recommend given our specific situation.We have a dynamic HTML page that displays 30 ""address labels"" within the dimensions of one single US-letter-size document. We want the user to be able to print the single letter-sized page and have the content line up perfectly (as it does in the browser) for the Avery address label (printed) sticker paper which they will use to then peel the 30 stickers and affix to physical product. The HTML page is ~ 200k worth of HTML (divs and tables), text, gifs, jpgs, a barcode PNG graphic, and heavy use of exacting CSS - CSS2 as well as a touch of CSS3 (CSS3 property transform), i.e. this: ...which I use to rotate (90 degrees) a barcode which I grab off of this site/service: http://www.barcodesinc.com/generator/index.phpWe could drop that barcode PNG/service only if I could easily replace it with another... and the barcode must be rotated 90 degrees - to thus fit in its tiny (vertically-oriented) alloted slot on each of the 30 ""address label cells"".I wish we had budget for the server version of PrinceXML ;-) ... but no luck. I have never used any PHP libraries like FPDF or TCPDF, but am concerned about speed; corporate users (on various browsers) will need the pdf in real time. They may be patient and wait for the final PDF if keep the solution free.. but if it takes minutes to generate, that is a minus point.Also I am not sure how good these are for HTML -> PDF (as opposed to straight PDF from scratch).. plus not sure how good is the CSS support. Our page is a bit of an HTML/CSS kludge.I have used the command-line tools HTMLDOC and wkpdf, but the former lacked the CSS I need now, and the latter introduces margin that kills it for exact address-label formatting (plus this project is on Linux).My PHP skills are not super strong yet.. but I am willing to do whatever it takes to pull any solution together.In case you have any familiarity with any PDF generation tools that you feel would fit the need here, then please advise! <code>  /* --- for firefox, safari, chrome, etc. --- */-webkit-transform: rotate(90deg);-moz-transform: rotate(90deg);/* --- for ie --- */filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=1);",Recommendation? for our specific HTML -> PDF project

So that seems unreliable for some reason.Is there a way I can read out the names of the worksheets from a large file so that I can access only one of its worksheets at a time? ADDENDUM:I found some code that gets close, but it doesn't seem to always be accurate, e.g. here it missed the second worksheet in a 27MB file:and here it only got the third worksheet and missed 3 others: <code>  $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReaderForFile(""data/"" . $file_name); $objReader->setLoadSheetsOnly(array($sheet_name)); $objReader->setReadDataOnly(true); $objPHPExcel = $objReader->load(""data/"" . $file_name); echo '<table border=""1"">'; for ($row = 1; $row < $number_of_rows; $row++) { echo '<tr>'; for ($column = 0; $column < $number_of_columns; $column++) { $value = $objPHPExcel->setActiveSheetIndex(0)->getCellByColumnAndRow($column, $row)->getValue(); echo '<td>'; echo $value .

"I need to debug php, what is my best choice?"," I'm working on a web site under a Linux environment (Debian). I'm not an expert at Linux but I can handle it, and the website is made using PHP, MySQL, HTML, etc.The thing is, I'm using PHP for the server side. Right now, for testing, I installed Apache on my PC so I can test everything. But, it would be great if I could debug the PHP code. So far, I didn't need it, but now the code is getting larger, it's a must.So far, I'm using vim and everything is fine, but, how can I debug PHP in my case? What tools should I install? Are they free?Basically, I need to know what would be the best choice in my situation. <code> ",I need to debug PHP. What is my best choice?

Is this too many dependenies to inject into an object through the constructor?," I am working on a social network type project in OO PHP and I do not want to use an existing framework. The main point of doing this project is to help me learn about more stuff. This question is more about dependency injection. Let's say I have these classes: core class - some core methods to do stuff in the appconfig class - loads site config stuffdatabase class - connects to mysql and does all database related stufflogger class - used to log errors and debug infocaptcha class - for captcha on formssession class - initiates a session start and adds, removes, gets session variables to use in the appcache class - similar to session class but for caches items (files cache, memcache, apc cache. I may even add my session stuff to this class someday since all these cache's can use the same type of methods)All the classes above will most likely be used on every page load in my app (I probably missed some more classes that will be added later on)Now in addition to the above classes which will need to be injected into most other classes, I will have many many more classes. I will have a secion called modules which will have stuff like...account class - creates new users, authenticates users, logs users in and out of the app, update user settings, and much more.users class - shows users profiles, shows users online, new users, all stuff to show users of the siteforums class - will be for the forums sectionblogs class - for the blogs sectionphotos class - all photo related stuffcomments class - handles comments for photos and profiles There will be many more of these type of classes for different sections of the site.This second set of classes listed above for sections will most likely require most of the classes from the first set to be injected into them. So should I use a registry to store the objects from the first set of classes and just inject the registry into all the class objects in the second set of classes? Or should I use the constructor to load them? In this example there would be like 7 objects to inject into the other classes, that seems like a lot. Am I going about this wrong? ---EDIT---I am aware of the singleton pattern but I don't think it is my best option here---EDIT 2---As some have mention, needing to pass in as much as 7 objects does seem like a LOT and that is why I am looking for suggestions. Luckily for me this project is at the beginning stages so now is the time for changes to the structure. An example would be a class in my forums section. The forums class would need access to session data, possible cached data, the configs object, database object. AM I going about this the wrong way? <code> ",Is this too many dependencies to inject into an object through the constructor?

Convert SVG image to PNG with PHP ," I'm working on a web project that involves a dynamically generated map of the US coloring different states based on a set of data.

Should you think there is any information I've left out, also, please tell me.Thank you.Eliminating duplicate declarationsIt tells me I cannot redefine a class. I have grepped all my files, and this class is defined only in its specific file ""Doctrine/ORM/AbstractQuery.php"".Note that initially the error was reported at the call to require at line 190 of the Symfony UniversalClassLoader.php, and I have changed this to require_once to make sure the file isn't loaded twice.Eliminating the case-sensitive filesystemBecause of the note I found here, I think it's I should share that I'm running PHP 5.3.5 on Windows 7.

Cannot redifine class on 'require_once'.," UPDATE: I've abandoned CodeIgniter, and the desire to build a web interface around my database application from PHP, as there was no way of getting rid of this bug...The ExceptionI get this exception: I am using Doctrine 2.0, with the Symfony UniversalClassLoader, as can be seen above, to implement a data-analysis script. To view the results, I have set up a CodeIgniter project.Here's what has me baffled with this exception: I have eliminated almost all reasonably causes, and found nothing. Tell me if I did something wrong in the elemination rounds here.If anyone has any clue whatsoever about what might be going wrong here, please help. Should you think there is any information I've left out, also, please tell me.Thank you.Eliminating duplicate declarationsIt tells me I cannot redefine a class. I have grepped all my files, and this class is defined only in its specific file ""Doctrine/ORM/AbstractQuery.php"".Note that initially the error was reported at the call to require at line 190 of the Symfony UniversalClassLoader.php, and I have changed this to require_once to make sure the file isn't loaded twice.Eliminating the case-sensitive filesystemBecause of the note I found here, I think it's I should share that I'm running PHP 5.3.5 on Windows 7. This should mean the bug/feature described below is of no influence. This behaviour changed in PHP 5, so for example with Windows the path is normalized first so that C:\PROGRA~1\A.php is realized the same as C:\Program Files\a.php and the file is included just once.Eliminating require duplicationI've now gone so far as to replace every single call in every library (and my own code) to the function require to one to require_once, and the error persists unchanged. This means that I can now safely say that no call to require is responsible. My question remains: what is?Debugger OutputRunning a debugger brings me absolutely nothing: Some additional inspection tells me that the file it's loading while it crashes is lib\Doctrine\ORM\Query\Exec\AbstractSqlExecutor.php, or the AbstractSqlExecutor class... thus, something completely unrelated. <code>  Fatal error: require_once(): Cannot redeclare class doctrine\orm\abstractquery in Q:\Digest\lib\Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\UniversalClassLoader.php on line 190Call Stack: 0.0007 330016 1. {main}() Q:\Digest\index.php:0 0.0058 330800 2. require_once('Q:\Digest\lib\CodeIgniter\core\CodeIgniter.php') Q:\Digest\index.php:163 0.2207 935856 3. call_user_func_array() Q:\Digest\lib\CodeIgniter\core\CodeIgniter.php:297 0.2207 935904 4.

NetBeans PHP Syntax Check," According to a poll here on StackOverflow, NetBeans is the best PHP IDE available.

I'm sure I must be doing something wrong?I've previously used phpDesigner, which is a great program, but I've only got version 2007, and it doesn't support xDebug (I'd have to buy the new version if I wanted that). So I thought I'd try the much vaunted (and free) NetBeans.But, as far as I can tell, it's syntax checking is horrible. For example: Note how the same file is handled by the two different IDEs.First phpDesigner:Pretty obvious where the problem is, right?Then NetBeans:Here there is nothing but a vague error message at the very bottom of the class, and it's not even near the function causing the error(!).So my question is: Is it possible to get better syntax checking in NetBeans? I'm presuming there must be a way, and I'm just being really dumb.Additionally: If this is not possible in NetBeans, what other free IDEs are available that do have this level of syntax checking?Thanks for any help.Some people have suggested Eclipse as a replacement, so I thought I'd test it. It too correctly recognises the syntax error. (Makes me wonder if NetBeans is bugged.) I may just switch to Eclipse. Are there any other IDEs people think are worth trying? <code> ",NetBeans: PHP Syntax Checking
MVC Question: Should I put form validation code in the controller or model?," On one hand form validation could be seen as part of the application logic and therefore belonging in the model.On the other hand, it deals directly with the input coming from view and handles displaying errors, etc. From that angle it makes more sense to put it into controllers.Which one is the right approach from the MVC point of view?P.S my form validation actually consists only of writing a list of fields, their rules, and passing it on to a form validation library, which returns true/false on whether it passed validation or not.Example: Should this be put into a controller or model? <code>  $this->load->library('form_validation');$this->form_validation->set_rules('name', 'Name', 'required');$this->form_validation->set_rules('email', 'Email', 'required|valid_email');//........if ($this->form_validation->validate()) // Process dataelse $this->register_form(); //A controller action that will show a view with errors",MVC Question: Should I put form validation rules in the controller or model?

Mysql count rows using filters on high trafic database," Let's say you have a search form, with multiple select fields, let's say a user selects from a dropdown an option, but before he submits the data I need to display the count of the rows in the database . So let's say the site has at least 300k(300.000) visitors a day, and a user selects options from the form at least 40 times a visit, that would mean 12M ajax requests + 12M count queries on the database, which seems a bit too much .The question is how can one implement a fast count (using php(Zend Framework) and MySQL) so that the additional 12M queries on the database won't affect the load of the site .One solution would be to have a table that stores all combinations of select fields and their respective counts (when a product is added or deleted from the products table the table storing the count would be updated). Although this is not such a good idea when for 8 filters (select options) out of 43 there would be +8M rows inserted that need to be managed.Any other thoughts on how to achieve this?p.s.

However, using this approach, how do i determine if the encoding has finished successfully ? What if users upload a corrupt video and ffmpeg fails to encode it ? How do i handle this in PHP ?How do i queue encoding of videos since multiple users can upload videos at the same ? Does FFMpeg has its own encoding queue ?

How to handle queueing of video encoding during multiple video uploads ?," I am working on developing a video streaming site where users can upload videos to the site (multiple videos at once using the uploadify jquery plugin).Now, I am faced with the question of encoding the videos to FLV for streaming them online. When should the video encoding process take place ? Should it take place immediately after uploads have finished (i.e redirect the user to upload success page, and then start encoding in the background using exec command for ffmpeg ?) However, using this approach, how do i determine if the encoding has finished successfully ? What if users upload a corrupt video and ffmpeg fails to encode it ? How do i handle this in PHP ?How do i queue encoding of videos since multiple users can upload videos at the same ? Does FFMpeg has its own encoding queue ?

Workaround for Facebook JS and PHP 3.0 SDK session and access token compatibility issue," In the PHP 3.0 SDK there is no getSession() or any session handling from outside the Facebook api available. Some days ago the developers of facebook have also somehow updated the JavaScript sdk, according to this blog entry and this bug report. Within the last few days, a change was introduced into the hosted JS SDK which broke all compatility between it and the current PHP SDK (2.x and 3.x). Developers who utilize both the JS and PHP SDK on their websites are likely to see server-side API failure.However, I don't know if that really effects my problem. Like in this question's answer I am retrieving the access token of the OAuth dialog with PHP and save the new access token in the session.Current workaroundThe following code shows how I am handling this sessions. $_REQUEST['session'] is the content of the response of the OAuth dialog. Here is how I handle the user data: The ProblemEverything looks fine while testing. Only once an error occured: the first time after permission was set. Now, since the app is online, it seems as if the error occurs on average with every second user in with the error: QuestionSo why is this happening? It is very hard to debug since the error seems to only occur when a user enters the app the first time, after the app authentication and the access token has changed. And even that is not happening every time. How should I handle the session and access token right with the new PHP SDK?Any help would be highly appreciatied!EditI found out that there are some IE issues with cookies/session inside an iFrame. As seen in this blog post. With that hint and some further research I added the following lines in my bootstrap: Now its much better, but the information from about 2 of 50 users get lost between the steps landing page (authentication) -> formular -> and registration. So there is still something I missed.Edit 2I edited my user handling from to This seems to help a little bit. I think the main problem is somewhere in my session.Furthermore I added a try/catch block to see if somewhere in my app a Facebook OAuthException is thrown. If this is the case, I redirect the top location to the Facebook Page and Tab to get a new signed request. Though this might help solve this problem, I want to prevent my app from having to redirect the user.Edit 3After some days of intense debugging and logging I found out, that the $_REQUEST['session'] coming from the FB.ui permissions.request method is empty infrequently.Here is how I handle it:This is the stuff I always included: And this function is called on form submit. Always worked for me, but somehow it still sends the form although session == ''. <code>  if(isset($_REQUEST['session'])) { $response = json_decode(stripslashes($_REQUEST['session']), true); if(isset($response['access_token'])) { $this->api->setAccessToken($response['access_token']); $_SESSION['access_token'] = $this->api->getAccessToken(); }}elseif(isset($_SESSION['access_token']) && ! isset($_REQUEST['signed_request'])) $this->api->setAccessToken($_SESSION['access_token']);elseif(isset($_REQUEST['signed_request'])) { Session::invalidate('fbuser'); $_SESSION['access_token'] = '';} try { $this->user = Session::getVar('fbuser'); if ($this->user === false || is_null($this->user)) { $facebookUser = $this->api->api('me?fields=id,name,first_name,last_name'); $this->user = new FBUserModel(array('fbId' => $facebookUser['fbId'], ...)); Session::setVar('fbuser', $this->user); }} $facebookUser = $this->api->api('me?fields=id,name,first_name,last_name'); An active access token must be used to query information about the current user. ini_set('session.use_trans_sid', 1);header('P3P:CP=""IDC DSP COR ADM DEVi TAIi PSA PSD IVAi IVDi CONi HIS OUR IND CNT""'); if ($this->user === false || is_null($this->user)) { // get user data} if ((is_object($this->user) && $this->user->fbId == '') || $this->user === false || is_null($this->user)) { // get user data} FB.provide(""UIServer.Methods"", {'permissions.request': {size : {width: 575, height: 300}, url: 'connect/uiserver.php', transform : FB.UIServer.genericTransform}}); function getPermission(form) { session = $('#' + $(form).attr('id') + ' input[name=""session""]'); if($(session).val() != '') { form.submit(); return; } FB.ui({method: ""permissions.request"", ""perms"": 'user_photos'}, function callback(info){ if(info.status=='connected' && info.session !== null) { $(session).val(JSON.stringify(info.session)); form.submit(); } }); return;}",How to properly handle session and access token with Facebook PHP SDK 3.0?

Are PHP constants a good modern development practice?," I'm working on a new project with a sizeable PHP codebase. The application uses quite a few PHP constants ( define('FOO', 'bar') ), particularly for things like database connection parameters. These constants are all defined in a single configuration file that is require_once()'d directly by basically every class in the application.A few years ago this would have made perfect sense, but since then I've gotten the Unit Testing bug and this tight coupling between classes is really bothering me. These constants smell like global variables, and they're referenced directly throughout the application code.Is this still a good idea? Would it be reasonable to copy these values into an object and use this object (i.e. a Bean - there, I said it) to convey them via dependency injection to the the classes that interact with the database? Am I defeating any of the benefits of PHP constants (say speed or something) by doing this?Another approach I'm considering would be be to create a separate configuration PHP script for testing. I'll still need to figure a way to get the classes under test to use the sandbox configuration script instead of the global configuration script. This still feels brittle, but it might require less outright modification to the entire application. <code> ",Are PHP global constants a good modern development practice?

Why submit a form to keep variables in UTF8 format," I have been struggling with this for three days now and this is what i have got and i cannot understand why i am seeing this behavior.my problem is that i have a MySql spanish db with char set and collation defined as utf8_general_ci. when i query the data base in delete.php like this ""DELETE FROM countryNames WHERE country = '$name'""the specified row doesnot get deleted. i am setting the variable $name in delete.php through a post variable $name=$_post['data'] . mostly $name gets the value in spanish characters e.g espaol, Mxico etc. the delete.php file gets called from main.php.if i send a post message from main.php $.post(""delete.php"", {data:filename}); , the query doesnot deletes the entry (although the 'filename' string is in utf8) but if i create a form and then post my data variable in main.php, the query works!! the big question to me is why do i have to submit a form for the query to work? what im seeing is my database rejects the value if it comes from a jquery post call but accepts it when its from a submitted form. (i make no code change for the query to work. just post the value by submiting the form) <code> ",How to ensure variables submitted in UTF8 using jquery $.post

What ways are there to store information about an anonymous user in a database?," Our application has an online shop among other features, and users are normally requested to register before completing a sale, creating a unique customer_ID in the process. When they return, they can log in and their contact details and transaction history are retrieved from the database.We are now exploring what to do in the case of an 'anonymous' or 'guest' customer, opening up the online shop to customers who don't want to register, and also for sales logged in the backend application, where taking the customer's email, postal address, etc is just too time consuming. The solution has applications outside the online shop too.Multiple companies use the same database, and the database is built on a party model structure, so we have explored a few options:Store all anonymous customers under one pre-defined customer_ID in the transaction table:customer_ID = 0 for every anonymous user, and customer_ID > 0 for every real userThis is straight-forward to hard-code into the applicationBut more involved to determine which customers belong to which companyShould details for customer_ID = 0 exist in the customer table in the database or as an object in the application?If in the database, what database-level constraints can be made to ensure that it always exists?If not in the database, then foreign key constraints from transaction.customer_ID to customer.customer_ID no longer workcustomer_ID is the same as the company party_IDEasier to determine aggregate sales for each company, etcThis would confuse matters as it would appear that the company is its own customer, rather than other unique customersGenerate a unique customer_ID for every new anonymous customer (per session)What if the same physical user returns? There will be many records repeating the same sort of data; email, shipping address, etc.Use another unique key, such as email address, to refer to a customerNot always reliable as people sometimes use more than one email address, or leave old addresses behind.What if there is no email address to be taken, as is the case on the shop floor, pro forma invoices, etc?Some other Stack Overflow inspired solution!AdditionA combination of #2 and #3 has been suggested elsewhere - attempt to store a single record for each customer, using the email address if possible, or a new record on every visit if not.I should point out that we don't need to store a record for every anonymous customer, but it just seems that the relational database was built to deal with relationships, so having a NULL or a customer_ID in the transaction table that doesn't reference an actual customer record just seems wrong...I must also stress that the purpose of this question is to determine what real-world solutions there are to recording 'casual' transactions where no postal address or email address are given (imagine a supermarket chekout) alongside online shop transactions where an email address and postal address are given whether they are stored or not.What solutions have the SO community used in the past? <code> ",What ways are there to store information about an anonymous/guest user in a database?

For example in the example - 'multi-colored' should become higher value because it is more specific to the subject. However it should include a prefix indicating it relates to the subject (it would become leaves-multi-colored).EDIT 2:Algorithm should remove words that have less than 3 characters unless they are in capitals or formatted otherwise  <code> ",What's an effective library for suggesting keywords for content?

Calling Excel through COM failed on Windows 7," Hey folks, this question can't be too complicated. Please provide a solution to at least figure out the ultimate root cause of the problem. I currently write an application, which controls Excel through COM: The app creates a COM-based Excel instance, opens some XLS files and reads their contents.Scenario IOn Windows 7, I start Apache and mySQL using xmapp-control with system administrator rights. All works as expected. The PHP-based controller script interacts with Excel as expected.Scenario IIA problem appears, if I start Apache and mySQL as 'background jobs'. Here is how:I created two jobs using Windows 7 Task Planner. One runs apache_start.bat, the other runs mysql_start.bat.Both tasks run as SYSTEM with elevated privileges when Windows 7 boots.Apache and mySQL work as expected. Specifically, Apache serves HTTP request from clients and PHP is able to talk to mySQL.When I call the PHP controller, which calls and interacts with Excel using COM, I do receive an error.The error message comes from Excel [not COM itself] and reads like this:Excel can't read the specified Excel-fileExcel failed to save the file due to an ill-name worksheetInterestingly, the first during the first run of the PHP-based controller script, it takes a few seconds to render the error message. Each subsequent run immediately renders the error message.Windows system logs didn't show a single problem report entry.Note, that the PHP program and the Apache instance didn't change - except the way Apache was started.At least the PHP controller script is perfectly able to read the file-system, since it provides the pathes to the XLS-file through scandir() of a certain directory.Concurrency issues can't be the cause of the problem. A single instance of the specific PHP controller interacts with Excel.QuestionCould someone provide details, why this happens? Or provide ways to isolate the ultimate cause of the problem (e.g. by means of a PowerShell 2 script)?UPDATE-1 :: 2011-11-29As proposed, I switched the Task Planner job from SYSTEM to a conventional user. Works. Apache and MySQL get started and process request.Unfortunately, the situation regarding Excel did't change a bit. Still, I see the error.As assumed earlier, the EXCEL COM server starts.

More accurate Vim jump to PHP definition," I know that it is possible to use Ctrl+] to jump to a definition in Vim and this can work in conjunction whith either ctags or Cscope. I am looking for a more accurate alternative to both ctags and Cscope when working PHP. Sometimes there are multiple possible results to choose from or false positives. I only want to jump to the actual definition of whatever is under the cursor. Ideally this should work for variables, functions, constants, and classes.I don't see why this can't be done by analyzing the files. I have finally overcome just about every other annoyance/misunderstanding I have with Vim by learning and customizing, so if I could nail this one it would be awesome.Also, do other's agree that Cscope and ctags are not accurate enough for PHP or am I doing something wrong?UPDATE4 years later, I am still using Vim with PHP, and still having this problem. I have tried eclim, ctags, exubarant-ctags, universal-ctags, and cscope. I have tried passing various arguments to these programs to get them to generate better tags. The experience is very poor for all of these options.But I understand the problem much better now. There might be nothing wrong with the tags generated by these programs. The problem seems to be that when you press Ctrl + ] in Vim or Neovim, it just looks for a tag by that name. It is not looking at the context of the file you are editing to see which tag by that name it should use. It does not even understand what language you are editing, and look for tags from code in that language.Is there a way to make vim search through the tags file more intelligently, based on the context, and then jump to the most likely location?

"Comparing PHP float variables - same number, but does not equal"," Possible Duplicate: How should I do floating point comparison? php integer and float comparison mismatch I have two variables, $_REQUEST['amount'] and $carttotal, on an e-commerce thing. They of course should match when attempting to process a payment, so as to prevent a manual override of the payment amount at the last minute, or of course, a calculation error. However: The above code, with the same numbers passed, is NOT giving me the equal. Basically I get the error message as if the $carttotal != $_REQUEST['amount'] is true (unequal vars). So to test the vars, I snuck in: To see what is going on (after I do the * 1 calculations to make sure they are dealt with as floats, not strings). I got this back: Very very frustrating. What could be causing this?  <code>  $carttotal = $carttotal * 1;$_REQUEST['amount'] = $_REQUEST['amount'] * 1;if($carttotal != $_REQUEST['amount']) { $code = 0; // cart empty under this user - cannot process payment!!! $message = 'The cart total of ' . $carttotal .

Proper and fast way to TELNET in PHP. Sockets are damn slow or how to TELNET with PHP cURL?," Almost all examples of the TELNET implementations in PHP are with sockets (fsockopen). This does not work for me, because it takes an unacceptable amount of time (~ 60 seconds).I have tried fsockopen for other purposes and found it slow in contrast to cURL.Question #1: Why are sockets that slow?Update: I found we need to set stream_set_timeout function, and we can control the socket execution time. I'm curious how to set the proper timeout or how to make it ""stop waiting"" once the response is received.I can't get the same thing implemented with cURL. Where should I put the commands which I need to send to telnet? Is CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST the proper option? I'm doing something like this: And then something similar to this: I am getting ""Max execution time exceeded 30 seconds"" on curl_exec command.Question #2: What is wrong with the cURL implementation? <code>  class TELNETcURL{ public $errno; public $errstr; private $curl_handle; private $curl_options = array( CURLOPT_URL => ""telnet://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:<port>"", CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 40, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => TRUE, CURLOPT_HEADER => FALSE, CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS => CURLPROTO_TELNET ); function __construct(){ $this->curl_handle = curl_init(); curl_setopt_array($this->curl_handle, $this->curl_options); } public function exec_cmd($query) { curl_setopt($this->curl_handle, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, $query.""\r\n""); $output = curl_exec($this->curl_handle); return $output; } function __destruct(){ curl_close($this->curl_handle); }} $telnet = new TELNETcURL();print_r($telnet->exec_cmd(""<TELNET commands go here>"")); ",Proper and fast way to TELNET in PHP.

"""Transiet"" properties in a PHP class?"," I've worked with PHP for a few years now, but up until now never had a need to deal with serialisation explicitly, only using the $_SESSION. Now I have a project that requires me to manually implement serialisation mechanism for certain data - and I realise that the issue is applicable to $_SESSION as well.I have a class that contains a number of properties. Most of these properties are small (as in memory consumption): numbers, relatively short strings, etc. However the class also contains some properties, which may contain HUGE arrays (e.g. an entire dump of a database table: 100,000 rows with 100 fields each). As it happens, this is one of the classes that needs to be serialised/deserialised - and, luckly, the properties containing large arrays don't need to be serialised, as they are essentially temporary pieces of work and are rebuilt anyway as necessary.In such circumstances in Java, I would simply declare the property as transient - and it would be omitted from serialisaion. Unfortunately, PHP doesn't support such qualifiers.One way to deal with is it to have something like this: However this is rather cumbersome, as I would need to update serialize method every time I add another transient property. Also, once the inheritance comes into play, this becomes even more complicated - to deal with, as transient properties may be in both subclass and the parent. I know, it's still doable, however I would prefer to delegate as much as possible to the language rather than reinvent the wheel.So, what's the best way to deal with transient properties? Or am I missing something and PHP supports this out of the box? <code>  class A implements Serializable{ private $var_small = 1234; private $var_big = array( ... ); //huge array, of course, not init in this way public function serialize() { $vars = get_object_vars($this); unset($vars['var_big']); return serialize($vars); } public function unserialize($data) { $vars = unserialize($data); foreach ($vars as $var => $value) { $this->$var = $value; } }}","""Transient"" properties in a PHP class?"

I'm making an order on tables, if the user wants to shift the order by moving the value upwards or downwards, the array should swap the value of the desired item upwards or downwards, for example:If the user wants to move the item order upwards: As you can see that banana and apple has been swapped, due to banana is moved upwards, if the user wants to move it down, it should swap pineapple to banana (from the first array) and so on.I looked around on functions, array_replace was closest, but it only replaces arrays. <code>  $desired_item_to_move = 'banana';$default_order = array('orange', 'apple', 'banana', 'pineapple', 'strawberry');// Typically it should return this:array('orange', 'banana', 'apple', 'pineapple', 'strawberry');",Moving up/down an item in the array by its value

regex pattern to get Youtube ID from any Youtube URL," Let's take these URLs as an example:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GqqjVXhfMU&feature=youtube_gdata_playerhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GqqjVXhfMUThis PHP function will NOT properly obtain the ID in case 1, but will in case 2.

This one is tough: Browser doesn't follow redirect from an AJAX response (PHP-generated response is using CAS authentication)," Ok, It looks like I made a mistake with my initial question. So, here are some corrections. The answer still applies, because the second redirect is stopped when there is a change in protocol to HTTPS (SSL).In my case, I have a redirect occurring multiple times, and the browser doesn't follow the second redirect. The first redirect is followed but returns an error.I keep reading that JavaScript AJAX responses containing redirects are followed automatically, but it look like not in my case. The first redirect is automatically followed by the browser, and the first redirect is returned without following the second redirect in the header. My problem is that I want all the redirects to be automatically followed by the browser.The redirects are part of the phpCAS library. I have an API written in PHP which checks the user authentication, each time, before returning the results.Here is the sequence. The main thing to note is that the browser returns the second response, after following 1 redirect. I would prefer it went all the way and returned the last response when I make an AJAX call to localhost/example/api.localhost/exampleCalls localhost/example/api using jQuery.ajax()Response 1: localhost/example/apiRedirects to https://localhost/accounts/cas/login?service=api.example.com&gateway=true (using SSL).Response 2: (SSL) localhost/accounts/cas/login?service=api.example.com&gateway=trueWhen the query key 'gateway' is present, the login simply redirects back to the URL provided by the 'service' key with or without a ticket (to signal to service that the user is either logged in or not).Response 3: localhost/api?ticket=TICKETVerifies the ticket and redirects back to itself without the ticket.Response 4: localhost/apiThis time the CAS client looks at the $_SESSION to remember what the ticket was, and then processes the API request returning JSONP.There's no particular reason I'm using CAS over OpenID or OpenAuth(orization). CAS was just the first authentication module I was able to get working in WordPress. I am open to suggestions in terms of using a different authentication library, CMS, framework, etc. Although, my hope is to just get this project finished. So the less re-tooling the better. <code> ", Browser doesn't follow redirect from an AJAX response (PHP-generated response is using CAS authentication)

Some users will not then go to use the contact form, so this means that the cookie is not strictly necessary for them.

arrays-references being copied (serialize PHP object-graph to JSON)," I wanted to serialize a complete PHP object-graph to a JSON string representation, and unserialize it back to an identical PHP object-graph.Here is a summary of options I considered, and reasons why they don't work for me:serialize() doesn't do what I want, because it uses a format specific to PHP.

(it also does not support JSON - XML is very long form, and is not what I want.)I now have a working implementation to share:https://github.com/mindplay-dk/jsonfreezeThe JSON-representation of the object-graph looks like this: This approach is designed to work for a pure tree-structure aggregate - circular references are not allowed, nor multiple references to the same objects. In other words, this is not general-purpose like e.g. serialize() and unserialize() which function for any PHP object-graph.In my initial approach I used a serialized form that was essentially a base-0 list of objects. The first object in the list (number 0) is the root of the serialized object-graph, any other objects are stored in the order they're found.In the current implementation, the JSON representation resembles the original tree-structure to the extend that this is possible, making it possible to actually work with the JSON representation of an object-graph in JavaScript. The only deviation is the magic #type property (prefixed with # to prevent collision with property-names) and the #hash ""type"", used to distinguish array-type hashes (stored as JSON objects) from regular array-type arrays (stored as JSON arrays).I'm leaving these notes about the previous version here for historical purposes.Circular references are handled simply by never storing nested objects inside the serialized representation of each object - instead, any object-reference is stored as a JSON-object with the object-index - e.g. {""__oref"":2} is a reference to the object with index 2 in the object-list.I'm having a problem with array-references in my implementation - when I var_dump() inside the code that restores references to objects to the array, they are being populated, but at some point the array gets copied, and you end up with the empty copy.

Serialize/unserialize PHP object-graph to JSON (solved)," I wanted to serialize a complete PHP object-graph to a JSON string representation, and unserialize it back to an identical PHP object-graph.Here is a summary of options I considered, and reasons why they don't work for me:serialize() doesn't do what I want, because it uses a format specific to PHP. I want a format that is widely supported by most languages, and human-readable/editable.json_encode() doesn't do what I want, because it only does simple values and arrays, not objects. (I'm actually using this in my implementation, see below.)var_export() doesn't handle circular references, and doesn't do what I want (see above.) (note that my current implementation does not handle circular references either - see comments and reply below for clarification of this issue.)Sebastian Bergmann's Object Freezer is a nice implementation, but it doesn't do what I want either - it uses a very long form, and relies on stuffing serialized objects with GUIDs.Serialized doesn't do what I want - it does not actually perform serialization, it parses the output of serialize() and produces a different representation, e.g. XML, but is unable to parse that representation. (it also does not support JSON - XML is very long form, and is not what I want.)I now have a working implementation to share:https://github.com/mindplay-dk/jsonfreezeThe JSON-representation of the object-graph looks like this: This approach is designed to work for a pure tree-structure aggregate - circular references are not allowed, nor multiple references to the same objects. In other words, this is not general-purpose like e.g. serialize() and unserialize() which function for any PHP object-graph.In my initial approach I used a serialized form that was essentially a base-0 list of objects. The first object in the list (number 0) is the root of the serialized object-graph, any other objects are stored in the order they're found.In the current implementation, the JSON representation resembles the original tree-structure to the extend that this is possible, making it possible to actually work with the JSON representation of an object-graph in JavaScript.

What is the purpost of the printf function?," This may seem like a really daft question, but what is the reason for the existence of the printf() function in PHP?It seems to me that that using echo will achieve the exact same results, with the added bonus that you don't get confused if you have several variables being output on one line (true, you can use %1$s as opposed to just %s, but it can still get messey with a few variables all being declared).I know you can also define the type of the variable, without the need to amend it before outputting the string, but to me that doesn't seem like enough to warrent creating a function.Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm missing something obvious, but if someone can help me to understand why it exists (so that I know whether or not I should really be using it!)

Android c2dm regigistration id format," I suspect I am going to feel really stupid after posting this but here goes. I have two main questions:1) What is an appropriate regex to use for the registration id? Currently I have the following but I have not been able to find any docs to support whether this is sufficient: 2) Is it ""valid"" for a regID to contain ""--""? I know that android can't go worrying about what every language - in this case mysql - uses for comments, etc. but this caught me a little off guard.

Remotely Scrape Page and Get most Relevant title or Description for Images," What I'm looking at doing is essentially the same thing a Tweet button or Facebook Share / Like button does, and that is to scrape a page and the most relevant title for a piece of data. The best example I can think of is when you're on the front page of a website with many articles and you click a Facebook Like Button. It will then get the proper information for the post relative to (nearest) the Like button. Some sites have Open Graph tags, but some do not and it still works.Since this is done remotely, I only have control of the data that I want to target. In this case the data are images. Rather than retrieving just the <title> of the page, I am looking to somehow traverse the dom in reverse from the starting point of each image, and find the nearest ""title"". The problem is that not all titles occur before an image. However, the chance of the image occurring after the title in this case seems fairly high. With that said, it is my hope to make it work well for nearly any site.Thoughts:Find the ""container"" of the image and then use the first block of text.Find the blocks of text in elements that contain certain classes (""description"", ""title"") or elements (h1,h2,h3,h4).Title backups:Using Open Graph TagsUsing just the <title>Using ALT tags onlyUsing META TagsSummary: Extracting the images isn't the problem, it's how to get relevant titles for them.Question: How would you go about getting relevant titles for each of the images? Perhaps using DomDocument or XPath? <code> ",Remotely Scrape Page and Get most Relevant title or Description for Images with XPath

Conditional fieldgroups/fieldsets," Background: In Drupal 7, I have created a form with CCK (aka the Field UI). I used the Field group module to create a fieldgroup, but I need it to be conditional, meaning it will only display depending on a previous answer.Previous research: To create a conditional field, you can use hook_form_alter() to edit the #states attribute like so: However, there seems to be no way to use the States API for fieldgroups. One thing to note is that, while fields are stored in $form, fieldgroups are stored in $form['#groups'] as well as in $form['#fieldgroups']. I don't know how to distinguish between these, and with this in mind, I have tried to apply a #states attribute to a fieldgroup in the same manner as above. However, it only produces server errors.Question: Is there a way to make a fieldgroup display conditionally using the States API or some alternative approach? <code>  function MYMODULE_form_alter(&$form, &$form_state, $form_id) { if ($form_id == 'person_info_node_form') { // Display 'field_maiden_name' only if married $form['field_maiden_name']['#states'] = array( 'visible' => array( ':input[name=""field_married[und]""]' => array('value' => 'Yes'), ), ); }}",Conditional fieldgroups/fieldsets in Drupal 7

How to calculate new gradient positions after the polygon it fills changes dimensions?," What I want to do?Updates to this question: 7/10/2012 - ""gradientTransform not quite"" Inspired by Duopixel7/11/2012 - ""SVG Code from the example"" 7/16/2012 - ""@dignifiedquire take on this problem""I'm trying to create a tool that let's the user dynamically resize polygons. Most of the polygons are filled with gradients fill=""url(#top_surface_1_gradient)"". The way I go about this is a simple JavaScript script that:looks for mousemove & click events over a certain polygonmeasures the amount of movementchanges half of the coordinates of the polygon (in order to have the effect of stretching) using this algorithm to define new coordinates: x = x_movement, y = x_movement * Math.tan( 31 * (Math.PI/180) )polygons that are filled with a single colour are OKpolygons that are filled with a gradient are not, let me demonstrate:VisuallySo this is step one, no stretching has been done by the user.This is where the problem happens. Since I don't know how should I change the x1, y1 and x2, y2 coordinates for the gradient, it just stays hanging in it's old position while the polygon has been stretched. The result is a shape that fails to sustain the illusion of depth.The end result I'm looking for. And bare in mind that the gradient might have a completely random angle from the get go. In this end result, that I'm looking for, both the x1, y1 and x2, y2 coordinates of the gradient have been changed. What algorithm should be used to calculate these positions? I'm looking for a solution that is completely blind to the angle of the gradient.Below is the SVG with all the appropriate coordinates that was used to generate these examples:Using SVG codeStep1: Step 2 Step 3 I've spent countless hours developing solutions for this problem and I just couldn't get my head around it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.Update: gradientTransform not quiteUsing the gradientTransform attribute and no x1,y1; x2,y2 coordinates for the gradient, we achieve results that fill the polygon in a way that is almost as needed (This solution can be found here: http://jsfiddle.net/hqXx2/). The only place where the solution breaks is when the polygon is filled with a gradient that starts outside of the polygon and/or ends somewhere outside/inside. Let me illustrate:This is what is achieved with the solution, that Duopixel is suggesting.This is the usage case that is impossible to achieve using the solution mentioned above. I changed the colouring in order to visibly amplify the angle and gradient stops.SVG Code from the exampleHere's the code for the larger, correctly expanded group of polygons: And here's the SVG code for the smaller one, which I need to expand: @dignifiedquire take on this problemI've implemented @dignifiedquire suggested algo in a test site: Here's the test link. I did the absolute to relative conversion on my own and it just shows the same result I would have normally adding the same polygon x and y change values to the gradient x and y. That is the main issue - how to translate those values into such value, that transform the gradient as in my examples above?More help is needed. <code>  <!-- Step 1 --><linearGradient

PHP: How to override register_argc_argv?," I'm using a shared host (fasthostingdirect) and for some reason they have this flag turned off by default.

How can I improve the standard NONCE library for PHP?," This is the first time I've worked with nonces, so I downloaded the script from http://fullthrottledevelopment.com/php-nonce-library. I did not like the code, especially because there's a chance of a legitimate request being treated as invalid because the function works in intervals of a defined amount of time (default is 300 seconds).For example, we could be 299 seconds into the 300 seconds when the nonce is generated, so the nonce would only work for 1 second.I modified the library into the following functions. What I did was check for the current interval and the previous interval by using nonce_create(time()-NONCE_DURATION)==$nonce. Are there ways to further improve the functions?: Also, I have two questions regarding the original library:Why isn't NONCE_UNIQUE_KEY used? Did the author simply forget?Why does the author divide by two here: $i = ceil( time() / ( FT_NONCE_DURATION / 2 ) );, it only works for half the time then (I tried it) <code>  define( 'NONCE_UNIQUE_KEY' , '123123' );define( 'NONCE_DURATION' , 300 );function nonce_create($time=false){ if(!$time) $time=time(); $i=ceil($time/(NONCE_DURATION)); return substr(md5($i.NONCE_UNIQUE_KEY),-12,10);}function nonce_is_valid($nonce){ if (nonce_create()==$nonce || nonce_create(time()-NONCE_DURATION)==$nonce) return true; return false;}",How can I improve this NONCE library for PHP?

Magento - Get Default Store Code within Backend," I am trying to find out the default store code from within Magento's backend. While this sounds rather simple, I just couldn't find any solution.The snippets I found are either (although this doesn't correspond to the default but the current store) or But from within the backend these will only return ""admin"" (since the backend is treated as some kind of special store with store ID 0 - which is the value of DEFAULT_STORE_ID). Could anyone please point me to a way to get the actual default store code from anywhere? (That store code that is set by Magento if both ""Add Store Code to URLs"" and ""Auto-redirect to Base URL"" options are activated)Just a little background why I need this: I need to generate a URL within the Magento configuration that still works if ""Add Store Code to URLs"" is activated. I can set any store code, so if I'm within the configuration scope of one of them, I can just use that one. But since it also has to work if the configuration scope is set to default or website, I want to use the default store code in that case.I found a solution with: However, this leaves me with some follow-up questions.Why does Mage::app()->getWebsite() return a special website object that only includes the special admin store, while Mage::app()->getWebsites() will return an array that only includes the usual frontend website, but not the object returned by getWebsite()?Why does the frontend website object occupy index 1 in the array, while index 0 is unused? I would really like to know the reason for having to use a magic number there (if I have to). <code>  Mage::app()->getStore()->getCode() Mage::app()->getStore(Mage_Catalog_Model_Abstract::DEFAULT_STORE_ID)->getCode(); $websites = Mage::app()->getWebsites();$code = $websites[1]->getDefaultStore()->getCode();",How to get the default Store code within the Magento backend

mcrypt_create_iv PHP openssl_random_pseudo_bytes," I need to up the security of our website, and is currently using the guide here: http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm, and also the generation of random passwords here: https://defuse.ca/generating-random-passwords.htm.

Am I right in assuming that PBKDF2_SALT_BYTES and PBKDF2_HASH_BYTES are both set to 24 bytes since the output of the pbkdf2() function would be just 24 bytes, not 32 (for 256 bits) since the underlying algorithm used is sha256?

Testing REST API's using PHPUnit," I am building a set of RESTful APIs and am now required to write unit tests for them. I am not sure what the unit tests should actually test.Should unit tests check whether the response being received from the server is correct for various inputs? If so, is it a good practice to have a set of correct response formats pre-defined and check the responses against them?UPDATEI am calling these services through CURL and I can definitely check status code. The response may vary for different inputs, so should I check for all possible responses?How is unit testing usually done for RESTful APIs using PHPUnit in general? <code> ",Testing REST APIs using PHPUnit

recursion vs iteration PHP," Iterative factorial function: Recursive factorial function: I have to develop a function to calculate factorial in my PHP program. I figured it out that I could do it in above both ways.What I don't know is which method is better to used and why? What's the industry standard? How can I select one of the methods between above two? What's the condition to determine which one is better?I know It's a lot of questions but since I'm new to PHP and hope someone will help me out. Given that, actually the function I'm using is not just factorial. It has got some other lines too which do some other tasks. For the sake of simplification let's assume that these are the two functions. So anyone can understand my question rather complexing it for no reason.What I'm basically referring to is the recursion vs. iteration in PHP. <code>  function factorial($number) { $result = 1; while ($number > 0) { $result *= $number; $number--; } return $result;} function factorial($number) { if ($number < 2) { return 1; } else { return ($number * factorial($number-1)); }}",Recursion vs. iteration in PHP

With JS I am assuming that I'd need to run an AJAX request to a PHP script to capture the info that I need and with an image pixel I am having issues getting the currently URL. I also thought about URL encoding the current URL with JS and dynamically placing the image pixel with the encoded current URL as a query string to a PHP script, but that I can get to be very long.

Paypal notify_url and return_url.

Transliterate any utf8 char into ascii equivalent," Is there any good solution out there that does this transliteration in a good manner?I've tried using iconv(), but is very annoying and it does not behave as one might expect.Using //TRANSLIT will try to replace what it can, leaving everything nonconvertible as ""?""

(Example: CategoryNotFoundException extends CategoryException and implements NotFoundException).Why should I need this interface?When an page is showing and some exception which implements the interface will throw an Error404 should shown.Example:  <code>  $userPage = $_GET[""page""];try{ showPage($userPage);} catch (){ //How to catch the `NotFoundException` interface? showPage(""Error404"");} catch (Exception $e){ showPage(""Error500""); //Something is wrong...}",Catch a exception with interface.

Deleting a Facebook post with $facebook->api," I am having trouble deleting a facebook post from my web app. Now I know the Facebook documentation and other SO posts say to do this: But since Im such a noob, I dont fully understand the short explanation of deleting with an HTTP request.

"Why does PHP's garbage collector slow down perfomance, and how to manage memory without it?"," This relates to a PHP 5.3 Cli application that processes a lot of data in a complex way, taking hours to run. Someone discovered that turning off garbage collection made it run a great deal faster (maybe as much as 50%). The only article I've come across that mentions this performance hit is http://derickrethans.nl/collecting-garbage-performance-considerations.html. I'm not sure I follow it entirely, but it seems to suggest that it only applies to code with a lot of circular references.Could someone shed some light on this please?Also, given that we have turned gc off, is there any way to manually reduce memory? Using unset() has been suggested. A quick test has shown that eighty or so bytes is freed by unset() regardless of the size of the object. This suggests it's just unsetting the reference, which is borne out by what I have read online. Am I right in thinking that these eighty bytes would be freed anyway, even without garbage collection, when the variable falls out of scope? <code> ","Why does PHP's garbage collector slow down performance, and how to manage memory without it?"
mobile app development with oauth 2 - how to create a server implementation, EDIT Originally I thought Oauth2 is the way to go but maybe it is not. I'll leave that out of this question for now as it is confusing things.I'm creating a mobile app (Android/iOS). I'd like the user to enter their credentials (user/pass) in the mobile device which would then get sent to my server (Joomla CMS) to verify the credentials and create/send a token. I don't want to store the user/pass on the device just the token.In addition this token needs to have a timeout to be refreshed when needed. Such as credentials have changed.At this point I'm trying to figure out what the architecture of this will look like.Are there any tutorials on how you can achieve this (ideally with Joomla)? Anything that someone could point me to? <code> ,mobile app development - how to create a server implementation
Editing html is browser," Many people are aware that people can edit the html source code of a website using the inspect element function available on most browsers.

Fields can often be made hidden and store a value that is necessary to run a certain query.

PHPUnit Mocking a Class?," Is there a way to create a mock class with PHPUnit which I can then create a new instance of by using its class name?I have an interface which defines two methods. Something like: I then have another class which accepts a class name, creates an instance of that class, checks if it is an instance of what it expects (FooInterface) and then calls two methods on that class to get some information. I know how to mock an object just fine. The problem is, since this class accepts a class name, not an object (it is a part of a Manager which creates instances of the given class as needed), I can't use a normal mock object.I tried to make a mock object then use that class name. It seems to create the object just fine, and even seems to have the functions I mocked out. However, it doesn't seem to follow the will($this->returnValue('myValue')) portion I set up later. So, it does have the functions which were mocked, but they all return null.Any ideas? <code>  interface FooInterface { function getA(); function getB();} class FooInfo { protected $a; protected $b; public function __construct($fooClass) { $foo = new $fooClass; if (!($foo instanceof FooInterface)) { throw new \Exception(); } $this->a = $foo->getA(); $this->b = $foo->getB(); }} public function testConstruct(){ $foo = $this->getMockForAbstractClass('Foo', array('getA', 'getB')); $foo->expects($this->any())->method->('getA')->will($this->returnValue('a')); $foo->expects($this->any())->method->('getB')->will($this->returnValue('b')); $copyClass = get_class($foo); $copy = new $copyClass(); // Passes $this->assertTrue(method_exists($copy, 'getA'); // Fails, $copy->getA() returns null. $this->assertEquals($copy->getA(), $foo->getA());}",PHPUnit turning an instance of a class into a mock after instantiation

Ensure file contents are UTF-8 encoded," In my application I read a csv file and display contents to the user. But there is a problem with encoding.I have two csv files example1.csv and example2.csv. I have both opened in notepad++, which shows ANSI encoding for example1 and UTF-8 without BOM for example2.First, I tried mb_detect_encoding function to detect encoding but it shows me UTF-8 in both cases, which is not correct.Second, I try to convert the file content to UTF-8 using utf8_encode. That works for the ANSI file. But for the UTF-8 without BOM file it seems that it was encoded back to ANSI. It displays instead of the german . Same for other special characters.I want to ensure that contents are always in UTF-8 format before displaying or processing them. So is there anything I do wrong? This is how I use the mb_detect_encoding function: and it prints UTF-8 for both examples. <code>  $file_content = file_get_contents($_FILES['file']['tmp_name']);die(var_dump( mb_detect_encoding($file_content))); ",Ensure a string is UTF-8 encoded
FPDF - Can it handle original PDF with mixed orientations?," I am using the FPDF() method (from FPDI_Protection.php) to import existing PDFs and apply password protection.

I can define the newly created pdf to be 11""X11"", which fixes the problem of one of the orientations cropping, but this is not ideal for printing purposes, as the PDF is scaled and left aligned, causing poor readability/printout.

"php: Cannot access cookies in Chrome, works properly in Firefox"," Basic situation and basic relevant info: I have a php code that executes before the opening <doctype> tag. The hope was to (if necessary) send a redirect based on user's browser's language preferences before anything else loads. The script attempts to do two things based on highest supported language preference:Use php: setcookie() to create a cookie with the two-letter language code. Example cookie name = value: x_language = esUse php: header(""Location: "" . $requestedSite); to redirect to a subdomain, Example domain: es.domain.comExample: The problem: Firefox works perfectly. Chrome (and other browsers) fail to recognize the cookies at all.I've boiled it down to this:print_r($_COOKIE) works properly in Firefox, and returns a lovely, populated array.print_r($_COOKIE) fails in Chrome, and returns an empty array.This is the core of the problem, my function doesn't recognize the existence of a cookie because Chrome doesn't. I've made sure every browser accepts cookies. I've checked dev tools to make sure the cookie is in place on all browsers, (it is).I realize a cookie's value isn't available until the next page load, but that isn't an issue here. Even after it is set, it won't read.There is no output above the initial setcookie();So how do I get Chrome (and other browsers) to recognize its own cookies?! Does anyone know why this would all work flawlessly on Firefox but fail elsewhere?On a lark I decided to try this. I created a file that only contains: Again, I see the cookie array in Firefox. Meanwhile, in Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari, I get an empty array. Could this be a server issue? <code>  if (isset($_COOKIE['x_language'])) { -Determine correct subdomain based on cookie value- -If not currently on that subdomain, redirect to it-} else { setcookie('x_language','es',time() + 31536000 ,'/','.domain.com' ); header(""Location: "" . $requestedSite);} <?phpprint_r($_COOKIE);?>","Cannot access cookies in Chrome, works properly in Firefox"

php - regular expressions," Here is a list of examples of PHP regular expressions examples. Maybe this helps someone, as admin/ or another user can't make clear that I was trying to share my approaches.preg_match does the search (preg_replace is a replacer).preg_match has three parameters - preg_match(FindWhat, FindWhere, GivingOutput);Example 1): preg_match finds only one result (the firstly found result), with two options: [0] or 1.Example 2): find everything (any characters,words..) inside our search criteria: (Note, that option 1 is not available if when you dont use brackets in search criteria (as we have above, in example 1)Example 3):If your target text has many same occurrences, like this:$text = 'Hello user Jimmy Jones, it\'s me. Hello user Mery Pawders, it\'s still me.';Now, here are two different matches, so, we need to use preg_match_all Example 4): search among many possibilities: Example 5): To find a string, while input text contains new lines, you must uses at the end; Example 6): Your search is always case sensitive. To make a case insensitive search, use i at the end (if you want, without s); Example 7): to search for special characters (like /"".<*'?, etc.) inside preg_match, you need to use this escape sign: \ Now, we can use the ^ operator, which searches for results conversely.Example 8): find everything rather than letters and numbers: For search and replace, we have a bit different structure, as we need to use the new variable.Example 9): find and replace everything rather than letters and numbers with other character, using this operator: ^ Example 10): search and add something inside the found results: Example 11): find all links inside text: Example 12): like the example 11 (but with replace) - find links in text and put them in anchored tags: Output will be the same sentence, but the links will be anchored.1) Tips: Do not use preg_match() if you only want to check if one string is contained in another string.

PHP Repository Pattern Design," Preface: I'm attempting to use the repository pattern in an MVC architecture with relational databases.I've recently started learning TDD in PHP, and I'm realizing that my database is coupled much too closely with the rest of my application. I've read about repositories and using an IoC container to ""inject"" it into my controllers. Very cool stuff. But now have some practical questions about repository design. Consider the follow example. Issue #1: Too many fieldsAll of these find methods use a select all fields (SELECT *) approach. However, in my apps, I'm always trying to limit the number of fields I get, as this often adds overhead and slows things down. For those using this pattern, how do you deal with this?Issue #2: Too many methodsWhile this class looks nice right now, I know that in a real-world app I need a lot more methods. For example:findAllByNameAndStatusfindAllInCountryfindAllWithEmailAddressSetfindAllByAgeAndGenderfindAllByAgeAndGenderOrderByAgeEtc.As you can see, there could be a very, very long list of possible methods. And then if you add in the field selection issue above, the problem worsens. In the past I'd normally just put all this logic right in my controller: With my repository approach, I don't want to end up with this: Issue #3: Impossible to match an interfaceI see the benefit in using interfaces for repositories, so I can swap out my implementation (for testing purposes or other). My understanding of interfaces is that they define a contract that an implementation must follow. This is great until you start adding additional methods to your repositories like findAllInCountry(). Now I need to update my interface to also have this method, otherwise, other implementations may not have it, and that could break my application. By this feels insane...a case of the tail wagging the dog.Specification Pattern?This leads me to believe that repository should only have a fixed number of methods (like save(), remove(), find(), findAll(), etc). But then how do I run specific lookups? I've heard of the Specification Pattern, but it seems to me that this only reduces an entire set of records (via IsSatisfiedBy()), which clearly has major performance issues if you're pulling from a database.Help?Clearly, I need to rethink things a little when working with repositories. Can anyone enlighten on how this is best handled? <code>  <?phpclass DbUserRepository implements UserRepositoryInterface{ protected $db; public function __construct($db) { $this->db = $db; } public function findAll() { } public function findById($id) { } public function findByName($name) { } public function create($user) { } public function remove($user) { } public function update($user) { }} <?phpclass MyController{ public function users() { $users = User::select('name, email, status') ->byCountry('Canada')->orderBy('name')->rows(); return View::make('users', array('users' => $users)); }} <?phpclass MyController{ public function users() { $users = $this->repo->get_first_name_last_name_email_username_status_by_country_order_by_name('Canada'); return View::make('users', array('users' => $users)) }}",Proper Repository Pattern Design in PHP?

Symfony2/FOSUserBundle - Route issues with mutltiple bundles," Similar to this problem, I need a separate login for both the admin and front end bundles of my site. The admin is actually a separate bundle located in vendors.Right now, my routing looks like:app/config/routing.yml: Both of the bundles' individual routing.yml files have: And my firewalls in security.yml: The problem is that the front end's automatically generated login links point to /admin/login rather than just /login, which is not what I want to have happen.So, how can I make it use the /admin/* links when I'm there, but just the / links when I'm on the front end?

segmentation fault with apparent no reason," Edit added.I am getting a segmentation fault from the PHP ternary operation. I'm using PHP (5.4.13). The statements: Dispatches a segmentation fault (I checked the apache error log for this). The commented statements above do not throw the segmentation fault.I doubt this is the only source error, but this is what I was able to narrow down. Almost all sites that use this php are now having this problem.I don't think this is a bug! More an error in php installation or in one of the dependencies. But as no function was used, only language features, I thought it could be narrowed down pretty easily.EDIT: I wanted to know what are the common problems that causes a segmentation fault, and if one of them can be identified from the above code so that I will know where to look for solutions and how to act. (this is the question, for those who wonder about it)EDIT 2:Ready now, there is no more assignment in $_GET, so I guess now it is advisable and valid. But the error is still there.EDIT 3:for valgrind, the trace is: and for gdb is: Final EditAs I suspected from the beginning it surely was from a corrupted installation of php and it's extensions.

This component describes its date format with code-words like yy, y, mm, dd, D, ...http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#utility-formatDateI would like to display the dates in the same format for both PHP and the Datepicker.I mean that PHP should output the date as in the format set by user, AND the Datepicker should show the selected date in the same format.Given that:The date format is necessarily described ""PHP style""I can't know a priori which format was set by users/!\ This not a problem of how to read/parse/display a date from a known format.Unfortunately, Javascript date format description is not the same as in PHP.For instance, these 2 date formats are equivalent but described differently in PHP and Javascript:PHP : Y-m-d (set by users)Javascript : yy-mm-ddAs you can see, I cannot just configure the datepicker with the PHP date format, because it will be misunderstood, or not recognized at all.Someone (in answers below) adviced to create my own ""date format standard converter"", matching each PHP symbol with its equivalent in JS date format description. Just like:Y => yym => mmd => ddy => yz => o...And then replace each PHP symbol with the JS one. And so ""d/m/Y"" will be translated into ""dd/mm/yy"", magically.But maybe somebody knows another proper way to make jQueryUI Datepicker understand PHP date format standard?EDIT: I wrote a tutorial that explains both the problem and the solution.

PHP Connecting to old MySQL servers," I understand that PHP's mysql_* functions are deprecated and I should not be using them.However, we have several legacy MySQL 4.0 databases, which neither the mysqli_* nor PDO functions support connecting to. What is the best way to continue using the latest PHP versions and still be able to connect to these databases?(Based on the description at the top of the PDO intro page, I initially thought PDO might be an option, but the Changelog further down the page suggests that support for pre-4.1 has been dropped in PHP 5.4)I understand that MySQL 4.0 is 10 years old and the real problem here is that we're still using it. Upgrading MySQL is a separate issue that's outside the scope of both my influence and this question. What I do have control over is the PHP version that we use - and I'd hate to have to stop upgrading PHP just because we need to connect to some old databases.Even PDO will no longer connect to these old MySQL servers.I should also clarify that we have several legacy applications accessing these databases, and we want to change these applications as little as possible. They are not in active development, and testing a change that involved rewriting large sections of code would quickly balloon into a rather large QA project.For this reason, invasive solutions such as rewriting the code or upgrading the MySQL version, are highly unlikely to be worthwhile. If they are the only solutions available, we'll probably end up doing nothing - using mysql_* as long as possible, and then freezing the PHP version (at least for these apps) as soon as the latest PHP can no longer connect.On the other hand, technically complex solutions (such as compiling something from scratch) are definitely possible, and are actually preferred to making extensive code changes. <code> ",Connecting to old MySQL servers

I recreated all object classes in PHP, but since in STEP the order of the properties is crucial, I need the exact same order of the properties. <code>  class foo { public $a = 1; public $c = 2; public $d = 3;}class foo2 extends foo { public $b = 4;}$test = new foo2;var_dump(get_object_vars($test)); array(4) { [""b""]=> int(4) [""a""]=> int(1) [""c""]=> int(2) [""d""]=> int(3) } array(4) { [""a""]=> int(1) [""c""]=> int(2) [""d""]=> int(3) [""b""]=> int(4) } ",How to get the hierarchical order of properties with get_object_vars?

What's the best way to redirect a single page for mobile devices?," I am attempting to find a solution to redirect a single page from my WordPress website to a mobile version (I do not want to redirect all mobile users for all my pages to a different page or theme, only just a single page).However, I have yet to find a plugin that can do this. In any event, Im just looking for an easy way to get a mobile device redirect going for my single page, hopefully through a method that continually updates itself like DetectMobileBrowsers or WURFL.Having done some research online, Ive come across some PHP code that can distinguish between different pages on a WordPress website, such as: What Im thinking of doing is putting some kind of mobile redirection script in that PHP code, so that I achieve my goal of only needing the mobile redirection to happen for one page on my website.However, I have attempted to put the code (both PHP and Javascript) from detectmobilebrowsers.com into that PHP code, and have tried putting it in both header.php and page.php to no avail (in fact, it crashes my site in most cases, or just doesnt work).

How to upload multiple files in PHP using jQuery and AJAX," I have designed a simple form which allows the user to upload files to the server. Initially the form contains one 'browse' button. If the user wants to upload multiple files, he needs to click on the ""Add More Files"" button which adds another 'browse' button in the form. When the form is submitted, the file upload process is handled in 'upload.php' file. It works perfectly fine for uploading multiple files. Now I need to submit the form by using jQuery's '.submit()' and send a ajax ['.ajax()'] request to the 'upload.php' file to handle the file upload. Here is my HTML form : Here is the JavaScript : Here is the code for processing file upload : }Any suggestions on how I should write my '.submit()' function will be really helpful. <code>  <form enctype=""multipart/form-data"" action=""upload.php"" method=""post""> <input name=""file[]"" type=""file"" /> <button class=""add_more"">Add More Files</button> <input type=""button"" id=""upload"" value=""Upload File"" /></form> $(document).ready(function(){ $('.add_more').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $(this).before(""<input name='file[]' type='file' />""); });}); for($i=0; $i<count($_FILES['file']['name']); $i++){$target_path = ""uploads/"";$ext = explode('.', basename( $_FILES['file']['name'][$i]));$target_path = $target_path . md5(uniqid()) .

Why would json_encode returns an empty string," I have a simple php structure with 3 nested arrays. I do not use particular objects and I build myself the arrays with 2 nested loops. Here is a sample of the var_dump of the array I want to convert to Json. In another script I have a similar structure and json_encode works fine. So I don't understand why json_encode won't work here.Edit : there seems to be a problem with the encoding. When mb_detect_encoding returns ASCII, the json_encode works but when it returns UTF8, it doesn't work anymore. Edit2 : json_last_error() returns JSON_ERROR_UTF8 which means : Malformed UTF-8 characters, possibly incorrectly encoded. <code>  array (size=2) 'tram B' => array (size=2) 0 => array (size=3) 'name' => string 'Ile Verte' (length=9) 'distance' => int 298 'stationID' => int 762 1 => array (size=3) 'name' => string 'La Tronche Hpital' (length=18) 'distance' => int 425 'stationID' => int 771 16 => array (size=4) 0 => array (size=3) 'name' => string 'Bastille' (length=8) 'distance' => int 531 'stationID' => int 397 1 => array (size=3) 'name' => string 'Xavier Jouvin' (length=13) 'distance' => int 589 'stationID' => int 438",Why would json_encode return an empty string

Should conditions go inside or outside of function," What is preferable: A function that decides itself if it should do anything, or deciding whether to call that function? or The example is trivial, but imagine enabling functions using configuration or access rights. Is there an accepted standard? My gut tells me to go for y() when there is something like exit() involved, breaking the normal flow. Otherwise, encapsulation and DRY would favor x(). What do you think?Edit I've expended the example. My question is really: If there is a condition on which a function/method should be executed, should that control take place in the function (tidy but outcome is uncertain) or outside it (calling is verbose, but expected output is always the same)? <code>  function x() { if ($userIsLoggedIn) { alwaysHelloUser(); } if ($visitorRegion != 'US') { alwaysDisplayNoInternationalShipping(); } if ($day == 'Sunday') { alwaysLockDownStore(); }}function alwaysLockDownStore() { //close store //offer alternative store //show opening hours //display form for user leaving order for next day exit(""Sorry, we are closed!"");} function y() { perhapsSayHelloUser($user); maybeDisplayNoInternationalShipping($region); sometimesLockDownStore($day);}function sometimesLockDownStore($day) { if ($day == 'Sunday') { //close store //offer alternative store //show opening hours //display form for user leaving order for next day exit (""Sorry, we are closed!""); }}",Should conditions go inside or outside of function/method

I'm currently using query_posts to modify the main query on custom pages on my site, which as far as I can tell works quite well, though I've read that using query_posts is bad practice for a number of different reasons. So, why am I using query_posts and not creating a WP_Query object you may ask? It's because I'm using the infinite-scroll plugin, infinite-scroll doesn't play nice with WP_query, but it works absolutely fine when you simply modify the main query with query_posts. For example, pagination doesn't work using infinite scroll + WP_query (main concern). On one page, I'm modifying the query to get most viewed posts. So after a lot of reading I gather that my other option to modify the main query is using pre_get_posts, though I'm somewhat unsure as to how to go about this.Take this for example:- Alright, so simple enough - if it's the home page, modify the main query and exclude two categories. What I'm confused about and can't figure out is:-the use case scenario for custom page templates. With my query_posts modification I can just drop in the array before if (have_posts()), select my page template, publish it and away I go. With pre_get_posts I can't figure out how to say for example $query->most-viewed etcarray( 'meta_key' => 'wpb_post_views_count', 'orderby' => 'meta_value_num', 'order' => 'DESC' , 'paged' => $paged, ) );How the heck do I do that with pre_get_posts and make sure it's paginated, ie. works with infinite scroll? In all the examples I've seen with pre_get_posts there's no arrays.  <code>  <?php $paged = get_query_var( 'paged' ) ? get_query_var( 'paged' ) : 1; ?> <?php query_posts( array( 'meta_key' => 'wpb_post_views_count', 'orderby' => 'meta_value_num', 'order' => 'DESC' , 'paged' => $paged, ) ); ?> <?php if (have_posts()) : ?><?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post() ?> <?php if ( has_post_format( 'video' )) { get_template_part( 'video-post' ); }elseif ( has_post_format( 'image' )) { get_template_part( 'image-post' ); } else { get_template_part( 'standard-post' ); } ?><?php endwhile;?><?php endif; ?> function textdomain_exclude_category( $query ) { if ( $query->is_home() && $query->is_main_query() ) { $query->set( 'cat', '-1,-2' ); }}add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'textdomain_exclude_category' );",WordPress - pre_get_posts in place of query_posts on pages

"What is faster, a big joined query or multiple small selects plus PHP?"," I'm running a cron task which makes lots of queries to a MySQL server. The big issue is that the server runs extremely slowly sometimes.I've got a relatively big query with 4 tables left joined between them, and 4 smaller queries with natural joins that also attack the first table. After throwing those queries, I then process the results and group them using PHP.What I'm planning is to somehow mix those 5 queries into just one big query, and then letting PHP do some quick sort()s when I need to do so.I'm also told MySQL queries run faster than PHP in terms of filtering and sorting, but I'm reasonably worried about it when talking about having 7 or 8 left joins. Some more specs about these queries (which I can't copy because of company policies):Every fetched row and field will be visited at least once.Every query runs based on a single main table, with some ""wing"" tables.Every query uses the same GROUP BY rule.Currently the PHP code splits some secondary queries results into multiple arrays. It should, if using a big query, also sort the results by multiple parameters.So, due to these problems, and maybe as a rule of thumb:What is faster, a big joined query with more PHP or multiple small selects with less PHP? <code> ","What is faster, a big joined query with more PHP or multiple small selects with less PHP?"
mysqli_fetch_all using primary key value as index," Currently I have something to the effect: Will output something to the effect: Is there a mysqli fetch filter (correct term?) that will use the primary key from the result set if one exists as the array index value?

"UTF-8, PHP, Win7 - Is there a solution now to save UTF-8 on Win 7 using php?"," Update: Just to not make you reading through all: PHP starting with 7.1.0alpha2 supports UTF-8 filenames on Windows. (Thanks to Anatol-Belski!)Following some link chains on stackoverflow I found part of the answer:https://stackoverflow.com/a/10138133/3716796 by Umberto Salsi(and on the same question: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2950046/3716796 by Artefacto)In short: 'PHP communicate[s] with the underlying file system as a ""non-Unicode aware program""', and because of that all filenames given to PHP by Windows and vice versa are automatically translated/reencoded by Windows. This causes the errors. And you seemingly can't stop the automatic reencoding.(And https://stackoverflow.com/a/2888039/3716796 by Artefacto: ""PHP does not use the wide WIN32 API calls, so you're limited by the codepage."")And at https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47096 there is the bug report for PHP. Though on there nicolas suggests, that a COM-object might work! $fs = new COM('Scripting.FileSystemObject', null, CP_UTF8);Maybe I will try that sometimes.So there is the part of my questionleft : Is there PHP6 out, or was it withdrawn, or is there anything new on PHP about that topic?// full QuestionThe most questions about this topic are 1 to 5 years old.Could php now save a file usingfile_put_contents($dir . '/' . $_POST['fileName'], $_POST['content']);when the $_POST['fileName'] is UTF-8 encoded, for example "".xml"" ?Currently it is saved as.xmlI checked the fileName variable, so I can be sure it's UTF-8:echo mb_detect_encoding($_POST['fileName']);Is there now anything new in PHP that could accomplish it?At some places I read PHP 6 would be able to do it, but PHP 6 if i I remember right, has been withdrawn. ?In Windows Explorer I can change the name of a file to "".xml"". As far as I have understood the old questions&answers, it should be possible to use file_put_contents if the fileName-var is simply encoded to the encoding used by windows 7 and it's NTFS disc.There is even 3 old question with answers that claim to have succeeded: PHP File Handling with UTF-8 Special Characters Convert UTF-16LE to UTF-8 in php and PHP: How to create unicode filenamesOverall and most approved answers say it is not possible. I checked all suggested answers already myself, and none works.How to definitly and with absolute accuracy find out, in which encoding my Win 7 and Explorer saves the filename on my NTFS disc and with German language setting?As said: I can create a file "".xml"" in the Explorer.My conclusion: 1. Either file_put_contents doesn'T work correctly when handing over the fileName (which I tried with conversions to UTF-16, UTF-16LE, ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252) to Windows, 2. or file_put_contents just doesn't implement a way to call Windows' own file function in the appropriate way (so this second possibility would mean it's not a bug but just not implemented.) (For example notepad++ has no problems creating, writing and renaming a file called .xml.)Just one example of the error messages I got, in this case when I used mb_convert_encoding($theFilename , 'Windows-1252' , 'UTF-8')""Warning: file_put_contents(dirToSaveIn/????.xml): failed to open stream: No error in C:\aa xampp\htdocs\myinterface.lo\myinterface\phpWriteLocalSearchResponseXML.php on line 26 ""With other conversion I got other error messages, ranging from 'invalid characters' to no string recognized at all.GreetingsJohn  <code> ","UTF-8, PHP, Win7 - Is there a solution now to save UTF-8-filenames on Win 7 using php?"

This is incredibly frustrating, since I can't expect users to log in again every time they've been idle for a few minutes.As far as I can tell, this problem should not be happening according to my config.yml file, which is as follows: For completeness, my current environment is as follows:Symfony 2.4.8PHP 5.4Session handler: default (file-based according to php.ini)Ubuntu Server 12.10Summary:What should be happening: users should not be logged out, even after being idle for hoursWhat is actually happening: users are being logged out after being idle for 15-30 minutesHow can I fix this? <code>  framework: session: cookie_lifetime: 0 # Session lifetime in seconds gc_maxlifetime: 28800 # Seconds after which data will be seen # as garbage and potentially cleaned up handler_id: ~ # Current using the default session handler",Symfony2 sessions not working as expected / session keeps timing out

PHP mail in Mac OS X Yosemite," I use the XAMPP stack for web development. I followed this tutorial a while ago to set my machine up to send mail from the localhost. This worked flawlessly under OS X Mavericks, but Yosemite seems to have broken it.I have tried all of the troubleshooting methods in the linked post to no avail and created this small PHP file in order to test them. This outputs false on my machine. I can still send mail using the terminal, for instance, if I run the command mail example@gmail.com my machine will send the email from my personal gmail address (the one I configured for the localhost) and it would show up in example@gmail.com's inbox. However, whenever I use the mail function in PHP the emails never arrive and are maybe never sent.I think the problem lies within sendmail, It has generated some crash reports like this...

what is the difference between sqli and pdo," I have recently started learning PHP.

Many posts have said that MySQLi supports procedural and object oriented method whereas PDO supports only an object-oriented method.What I want to know is that:Are these two (PDO and MySQLi) just two different ways of doing the same thing or are they different from each other?If they are just two different ways to do the same thing then what is the difference between them and which one is a better way to perform the task?If learning MySQLi, which one is better method between object-oriented and procedural?For some it may seem to be a broad question, but I would be highly obliged if anyone can give specific answer for these three questions. <code> ",What is the difference between MySQLi and PDO?

PHPUnit - Test code or tested code did not (only) close its own output buffers," The question: Why would PHPUnit appear to be running in strict mode?The issue: PHPUnit 4.3.1 by Sebastian Bergmann.

Done.Also: Risky Test: Test code or tested code did not (only) close its own output buffersMy PHP Version is 5.4.As stated in the documentation (https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/strict-mode.html) this only appears to apply to PHPUnits' strict mode setting. PHPUnit can perform additional checks while it executes the tests. In addition to the fine-grained control over the various strict mode checks (see below) you may use the --strict commandline option or set strict=""true"" in PHPUnit's XML configuration file to enable all of them.- Output During Test Execution PHPUnit can be strict about output during tests. This check can be enabled by using the --disallow-test-output option on the commandline or by setting beStrictAboutOutputDuringTests=""true"" in PHPUnit's XML configuration file. A test that emits output, for instance by invoking print in either the test code or the tested code, will be marked as risky when this check is enabled.I believe though, that I did not activate strict mode. My command line is ""/usr/bin/php /usr/bin/phpunit --colors --bootstrap /full/path/to/bootstrap.php --configuration /full/path/to/configuration.xml /full/path/to/Test.php"".

PHP array copying and passing," I'm trying to figure out how does PHP load arrays to memory and when does passing an array consume memory.So Ive got this little bit of code running: note that the input array is less important in this example: This consumes exactly 250 kB of memory, this means the array is roughly 250 kB in size, roughly.So I ran the following code: According to what I read and was told, PHP doesnt actually copy the array, it only references the original array, but once a change is made PHP has to copy the entire array.Imagine my surprise when the above code consumes exactly 500 kB of RAM.Can anyone explain whats going on here? Just to be clear, all these indices (05 and id) already exist in the original array, Im just modifying the value. The original value is some integer.EDITJust to clear the involvement of $this->result(); Here's another test I've conducted : This time the output is exactly 250 kB - Just like the original trial without any changesEDIT #2As requested, I've ran the code from here on my setup, to make sure results are consistent :http://pastebin.com/cYNg4cg7These are the results : DECLARATION: 4608 kBFINAL: 8904 kBDIFF TO DECLARATION: 4296 kBSo even though the declaration was 4608 and the array was passed and changed 4 times, it's still only less than doubled the memory footprint. EDIT #3 I've ran the memory changes after each allocation : DECLARATION: 5144 kBallocating A0 added : 144 kBallocating A1 added : 1768 kBallocating A2 added : 1768 kBallocating A3 added : 1768 kBFINAL: 10744 kBDIFF TO DECLARATION: 5600 kBEach following operation after the first costs exactly the same, which seems to indicate the exact same size is being copied.

Also, dd($templates) returns the entire object(Illuminate\Pagination\Paginator) collection, which has my results, but not in an accessible way.

How to calculate a CRC32 of an arrayBuffer (javascript) compatible with php," On the client side (Javascript) I'm using the FileReader() Object to read a local file from a browser and this file is sent to the server (PHP) thanks to the XMLHttpRequest() object. The object I recover thanks to the FileReader object is an arrayBuffer. This ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer and its content can not be manipulate directly.To optimize the transfer I split the file in several chunk. I want to check the integrity of each chunk transferred (Each chunk is about 100KB). The idea is to calculate the CRC on the javascript side and the server side, then compare the two CRC to check the integrity and retry the transfer if needed.JAVASCRIPT PHP <code>  var fileReader = new FileReader();fileReader.onload = function(event){ var arrayBuffer = event.target.result; // // TODO : calculate the crc of this arrayBuffer var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); ... xhr.open(YourMethod,YourUrl,true); ... xhr.addEventListener('loadend', function (event) { var CRCFromPhp = event.target.responseText; // TODO : compare the CRC from php with the CRC from javascript }}fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob); $file_crc = hash_file(""crc32b"",$target_file,FALSE); $file_crc = sprintf('%u',hexdec($file_crc)); echo $file_crc; ",How to calculate the CRC of an arrayBuffer (From FileReader in javascript) compatible with the CRC32 function in php?

Using Content-ID and cid for embedded email images," I'm generating emails in a PHP application which attach multiple files to an HTML email.

How efficient is insert_last_id?," I recently came across a problem where I needed to be able to grab the last ID of a query I've inserted on a page. The process was quite simple, but I'd like some reassurance on how the process is done. Here's how my code is: As you can see I have just inserted something into mybb_quickexample, which then generates an ID. Now in the code directly under it, I try to locate the ID. As you can see, it grabs the recent ID and puts it into the new table. Allowing for these 2 tables to correspond with each other later on when I need them to.However, does insert_last_id grab the last row inserted into the database or the last row inserted into the database on the page? Now I'm not entirely sure of the mechanics behind this, but I ask this because, what if a person was to load this page at the same exact time as another person? Would there be unmatched ID grabs or would the code still work? <code>  $query30 = $db->query(""INSERT `mybb_quickexample` SET `player1` = '"".$row19[username].""', `player2` = '"".$row18[username].""', `games` = '"".$numberofgames.""'"")or die( mysqli_error()); $mmid = $db->insert_id(); foreach($_POST['optiontitle'] as $val){$val = $db->escape_string($val); //echo $val;$query30 = $db->query(""INSERT `mybb_quickexample2` SET `gid` = '"".$id.""', `mid` = '"".$mmid.""', `optiontitle` = 'OPTION TITLE', `option1` = '$val'"")or die( mysqli_error());}",How efficient is Last_insert_id?

core ui select not working for mobile users," I am using the script ""core ui select"" to style my forms on my website. Everything was working fine for desktop users, but since a while there is a lot of reports from users using mobiles.

Then i realised that the whole form stopped working, but only for mobile users Here's a test page if you want to see the problem live (you would have to change your user agent to reproduce the bug) :https://www.ni-dieu-ni-maitre.com/test_mobile.phpAnd here's the code of the page. <code>  <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""https://www.no-gods-no-masters.com/scripts/jquery-1.8.2.min.js""></script><link href=""https://www.no-gods-no-masters.com/scripts/css/core-ui-select.css"" media=""screen"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""><link href=""https://www.no-gods-no-masters.com/scripts/css/jquery.scrollpane.css"" media=""screen"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""> <script> $(document).ready(function(){ $('#impression').coreUISelect(); }); </script></head><body><select class=""b-core-ui-select__dropdown"" name=""impression"" id=""impression""><option>Printing on front</option><option>Printing on back</option></select><script src=""https://www.no-gods-no-masters.com/scripts/js/jquery.core-ui-select.js""></script></body></html>",Core ui select not working for mobile users
2 mysql tables USERS and FLASHCARDS - modify one depending on the other?," I'm implementing a flashcard app, hence my FLASHCARDS table contains fields such as QUESTION and RESPONSE, and my USERS table is just that - names and personal info of my flashcard app.Here's where I get confused. The FLASHCARDS table will hold 100s of questions and responses categorized into ""groups"" of flashcards (or decks). When the USERS ""use"" the flashcards they will also be able to decide if the question was EASY, NORMAL, or DIFFICULT - hence modifying the time till the card is next shown.If I only had one user this wouldn't be a problem - I'd just modify the FLASHCARDS table accordingly, but Ill also have 100s of users. How can I modify FLASHCARDS table depending on each USERS decision of EASY, NORMAL or DIFFICULT and keep record of all of this for each user (I imagine in USERS table). <code> ",MySQL tables USERS and FLASHCARDS - how to modify one depending on the other?

json_decode AND json_encode long integers without loosing data," As noted in the PHP documentation, when json_decodeing a data structure containing long integers, they'll be converted to floats. The workaround is to use JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING, which preserves them as strings instead. When json_encodeing such values, JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK will encode those numbers back into large integers: Using this method for a correct roundtrip of the data is prone to errors. If a property contains '123', a numeric string which should stay a string, it will be encoded to an integer.I want to get an object from the server, modify one property and than put the entire data structure back. I need to preserve the original types. I don't want to maintain properties other than the one I'm manipulating.Is there any real workaround for this? PHP does not have any issues with big ints anymore, but the json_decode routine seems to be outdated. <code>  $json = '{""foo"":283675428357628352}';$obj = json_decode($json, false, JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING);$json2 = json_encode($obj, JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK);var_dump($json === $json2); // true",json_decode AND json_encode long integers without losing data

Traits with PhP and Laravel," I am using Laravel 5.1 and would like to access an array on the Model from the Trait when the Model before the model uses the appends array.

Are traits actually usable in this scenario or should I use inheritance? Here is how my current setup works.Trait Model What I would like to do is something to achieve the same effect as extending a class. I have a few similar traits, so using inheritance gets somewhat ugly. I have seen some workarounds for this, but none of them seem better/cleaner than just adding the item to the array manually.

playing 40.000 unit army for game," SOLVED!! (look at my last edit)I want to make an army fight of 20.000 vs 20.000 units on canvas. So, for every unit data is: And i would to see this fight in real time (25 frames per second).If i generate 1 frame with Json and save on file, it is 2.5mb size (40k such units with this data). 1 second(25 frames) = 62.5 mb file size. And the fight could last about 30 minutes, so it should use 112gb. This is bad. If i would make the file as binary data, it should take 27 times less place, or 4gb for 30 mins. That's still bad. 2 hrs movie takes 700mb.I need to save many fights on server. Real players should make their armies and fight each other, so i need the fights to be saved. Every fight is unique, because every damage of every unit is random 0~10 and after unit kills an enemy, it regenerates 1 health. I'm doing calculations with PHP and saving files on server. All 40.000 units are on one screen, all can be visible at once, i want it like that. For now, units are single 2x2 pixel cubes, red and blue teams, its easy to load for javascript. But, to generate file with PHP i need about 1 hour. That's another problem. Because for every frame i need to iterate these 40.000 units (for updating x/y, searching for nearby enemies or friends, then for doing damage and returning target or killed enemy coordinates), then iterate over again to unset killed units, and before putting all that into file, i need to iterate over everything and remove unused data that was used for calculations. And to finish this 30 mins fight i need to repeat it 45000 times. Also, every minute there are less and less units. But my point is somehow to make all that file generating in less than a minute, just need a logical way, if some exist.Questions: 1) What is the best way to save my files on server and make the files much less on size?(so far is to use binary data and compress to zip)2) what is the fastest way to calculate my fights?(so far is to compile with C++)// Edited. Here is my whole game code, just like that :)This is main action: This is unit: This is js: SOLVED! Thx to my colleague in my work! He gave me brilliant idea!To get the result i needed i just need for every next battle to generate random number (0~10000) and place it into single MySQL database. In addition also put there formations, units, their starting strength, health and everything else. And all the calculations do with javascript:With one constant number (given from backend) i make a formula to always reproduce same army fight -> every unit will move forwards and they always stop at the same time anyways no matter what the calculation. The uniqueness is the random damage every unit gives and what process after. And all the damage will be just their ""x/y position somehow compared to constant number"" and do whatever to get single damage, random for every unit because they all are in different map positions, but damage will always be 0~10. With the same constant number, all units will always do the same damage after calculation and always will move same at every replay, die and do same damage at every replay. All the hardest work will be on javascript - to make calculations using this constant number. My random number can be any. If first fight i generate random number ""17"", and next battle i generate random number ""19666516546"", it will not mean that battle with number ""17"" will do less damage - they all will do the ""random"" damage 0~15 to every unit, but replays with same formations, unit numbers, starting position and this random generated number will be always the same -> no more need to save any files! And i can add various spec effects, add something like defences, evasions, and all will fit in two MySQL rows - for every team :) Cool!! <code>  { 'id' => 17854,'x' => 1488, 'y' => 1269, 'team' => 'red', 'health' => 10,'target' => [1486, 1271]} class Simulator{ private $units; private $places = []; private $oldPlaces = []; public function initiateGame() { $this->createUnits(); $this->startMoving(); } private function createUnits() { foreach(range(0, 150) as $column) { // i like exact army formation to look nice, so its 150x140=21000 units foreach (range(0, 140) as $row) { $this->setUnits($column, $row); } } $this->oldPlaces = $this->places; } private function setUnits($column, $row) { $beginning_of_team_A = 6; //starting point on canvas for A unit to look nice on screen $unit_size_and_free_place = 6; //unit size= 3x3 (look js), and free place between each unit is 3 pixels. $beginning_of_team_B = 1100; // next side where enemy army starts appearing $x_a = $beginning_of_team_A + $column * $unit_size_and_free_place; // team A $y = $beginning_of_team_A + $row * $unit_size_and_free_place; // same for both teams $unitA = new Unit($x_a, $y, 1); // 1 is team A (it goes always +1 pixel every frame) $this->units[] = $unitA; $x_b = $beginning_of_team_B + $column * $unit_size_and_free_place; // team B $unitB = new Unit($x_b, $y, -1); // -1 is team B (it goes always -1 pixel every frame) $this->units[] = $unitB; $this->places[$x_a.','.$y] = 1; // now that way tracking units, and calculating their next move $this->places[$x_b.','.$y] = -2; } private function startMoving() { set_time_limit(30000); // by default after 1 minute it throws exception foreach(range(0, 400) as $frame) { //giving 400 frames is like 400/40=10 seconds of action $this->places = []; foreach($this->units as $unit) { $returned = $unit->move($this->oldPlaces); //giving whole units list to every unit to look forward $this->places[$returned[0]] = $returned[1]; // returns (next x/y position as string ['1514,148'] ) = ( id as int [15] ) } file_put_contents('assets/games/'.$frame.'.json', json_encode($this->units)); // writing into file every frame and it uses ~2mb $this->oldPlaces = $this->places; //resetting old positions } }} class Unit{ public $x = 0; public $y = 0; public $team = 1; public $stopped; public function __construct($x, $y, $team, $stopped = false) { $this->x = $x; $this->y = $y; $this->team = $team; $this->stopped = $stopped; } public function move($places) { $this->checkForward($places); return [$this->x.','.$this->y, $this->team]; } private function checkForward($places) { $forward = $this->x + $this->team; // TODO: find out formula to replace the 4 ifs $forward1 = $this->x + $this->team*2; $forward2 = $this->x + $this->team*3; $forward3 = $this->x + $this->team*4; if(isset($places[$forward.','.$this->y])) { $this->stopped = true; } else if (isset($places[$forward1.','.$this->y])) { $this->stopped = true; } else if (isset($places[$forward2.','.$this->y])) { $this->stopped = true; } else if (isset($places[$forward3.','.$this->y])) { $this->stopped = true; } else { $this->stopped = false; } if($this->stopped == false) { // move forward it is not stopped $this->x = $this->x + $this->team; } }} var app = angular.module('app', []);app.controller('game', function($scope, $http, $interval) { var canvas = document.getElementById(""game""), context = canvas.getContext(""2d""); var frame = -2; $scope.attacking = false; var units = []; function start_animation_loop() { $scope.promise = $interval(function() { if($scope.attacking == true) { frame ++; if(frame >= 0) { downloadFile(); animate(); } } }, 40 ); } function downloadFile() { $http.get('assets/games/'+frame+'.json').success(function(response) { units = response; }); } function animate() { clear_canvas(); draw(); } function clear_canvas() { context.clearRect(0, 0, 1800, 912); } function draw() { for(var a=0; a<units.length; a++) { context.beginPath(); context.fillRect(units[a]['x'], units[a]['y'], 3, 3); if(units[a]['team'] == 1) { context.fillStyle = 'red'; } else { context.fillStyle = 'blue'; } } } start_animation_loop();});",Playing 40.000 unit army for game

PHP(7) type hinting and multiple constructors," I've been looking into the new features for PHP7 and thought I might begin to ready my project for the new features it introduces, like scalar type hinting.One of the first problems I encountered was my constructors in various classes. I have some generic contrustors that acts something like this: Introducing type hinting for this method will of course throw errors in all directions.As far as I know PHP7 does not introduce support for multiple constructors. Are there any ways to get around this problem, or is this one of the limitations of the language? <code>  public function __construct($data = null) { if (is_numeric($data)) { $this->controller->createById($data); } elseif (is_array($data)) { $this->controller->createByArray($data); } elseif (strlen($data) > 0) { $this->controller->createByUrl($data); }}",Type hinting and multiple constructors

How to calculate longest undefeated streak using MySQL," I'm creating a web page that lists various longest streaks for a single team, but I've encountered an issue when trying to calculate a streak for a combination of result types involved.The data is presented in a table as follows...

It does exactly what I want it to and tells me what I want to know - the same applies if I change to What I can't work out is how to calculate the longest streak of undefeated games i.e. the longest run without an L. And it's the same vice-versa.I've tried the following query to no avail: I've also tried altering the query to: Again, this doesn't work. Both attempts mirror the query that's used to deliver the longest streak of Ws or Ls - and a manual count of my data tells me that isn't correct.

Storing requests in objects. Some trick needed," I have been working on a client - server project. The server side implemented on PHP. The client implemented on C#. The websocket is used for connection between them.So, here is the problem. Client will make a request. Json is in use for sending objects and validating against the schema. The request MUST HAVE it's name and MAY contain args. Args are like associative array (key => value).Server will give a response. Response MAY contain args, objects, array of objects. For example, client sends a request like: For this, server will reply with an AuthSuccess or AuthFailed response like: If response is AuthSuccess, client will send a requst of who is online. Server must send an array of users. And so on. So the problem is, how to store those responses on a client side. I mean, the way of creating a new object for each response type is insane. They will be hundreds of request types, and each of them requires it's own response. And any changing in structure of request will be very very hard...Need some kind of pattern or trick. I know it's kind of a noob way... But if anyone has a better idea of implementing request/response structure, please tell it.Best regards! <code>  { ""name"": ""AuthenticationRequest"", ""username"": ""root"", ""password"": ""password"", ""etc"": ""etc"" } { ""name"": ""AuthFailed"", ""args"": [ { ""reason"": ""Reason text"" }] }",Parsing (many) JSON different objects to C# classes.

CodeIgniter callable form validation bug," I have a problem with my form validation rules (in a seperate config file). This occurs with checkboxes.To organize my validation rules, I created a library file called validation_rules. This library contains all my custom callbacks like valid_date etc. To be able to call these rules, I load the library, and then use the following config: Where $ci is a reference to CodeIgniter ($this).Now this works fine for most types of input, but it doesn't work for checkboxes that are left empty, probably since they don't get posted.HOWEVER, when I ditch my library and simply add the callback to the controller, everything works fine with the following config: Also, when I add the rules required anywhere in the rules array (or string), the required rule does get called (returning false since the checkbox is not checked), but all other rules are completely ignored.This must be a bug in CodeIgniter right? Does anybody have a solution or workaround?

PHPStorm type hinting using PHPDoc in subclasses," With respect to this post:In PHPStorm, how can I make type hinting work when I have a superclass method that returns a different type from each subclass,this one is about an edge case in PHPStorm type hinting. Please try to follow along - I'll do my best to be as clear as possible:So, I've got this base abstract class: which another class inherits from: and which is further extended by a third class: Below is a sample of the myModel class: My true question is how to properly ""phpdoc"" this scenario:A subclass myNewController is using an inherited variable _model to assign an instance of another class myModel which has a unique function form. How should PHPStorm properly find out about form in myNewController?My solution so far involves documenting myBaseController like this: However I think @var object is too broad (PHPStorm won't find its declaration) and my guess is that there should be a better (and more specific) way to do this.Maybe we could instead do: if PHPStorm had a way of looking into the subclasses for the method.Any ideas?Thank you all in advance. <code>  abstract class myBaseController { protected $_model; ...} class myController extends myBaseController { $hello = 'hello'; ...} class myNewController extends myController { public $myvar; $this->_model = new myModel(); ... public function myFunc(){ // !!form is underlined as: ""Method 'form' not found in class""!! $form = $this->_model->form($new_variable); } class myModel extends BaseModel { $world = 'world'; public function form($my_variable) { do_something(); } abstract class myBaseController { /** * @var object */ protected $_model; ...} /** * @var BaseModel */",PHPStorm type hinting subclasses of baseclass

Writing the full path of the file when it is browsed uisng php," So far I wrote a script so that I can browse for a file and see the printed name of the file.

Is there a way to print the whole address of the file? What I have found on the web so far were mostly suggesting ways when we know in advance ""/path/to/file"". But how can it be done if I randomly choose a file? If there is no way to do it with PHP because of security issues according to: How to get full path of selected file on change of <input type=file> using javascript, jquery-ajax?, Is it possible t do it with C, C++, html, etc?I really need to show the local path of the directory. What are the alternatives? The answer is it can't be done? I found this website http://www.htaccesstools.com/articles/full-path-to-file-using-php/Don't know how it works though.The other alternative would be to define a fixed path and let the user only choose that directory and since it is known I can print it out.

Return the amount of overlapping minutes between to PHP DatePeriods," I just asked this question and it was marked as already answered but whoever did that obviously did not understand the question. This post was marked as a duplicate question to this, How to get time difference in minutes in PHP , but they are not even remotely the same. I'm looking for the amount of overlapping time in two DatePeriods not the difference between two dates.A ""DatePeriod"" consists of two dates and I'm looking for the amount of overlap between two DatePeriods. There is another post I found that answers half of my question here, Determine Whether Two Date Ranges Overlap and it works great but it does not give me the amount of time overlap between the two date ranges. It only determines if they overlap or not. I need to know the amount of minutes that they overlap. So Here is my original question...I assumed there would be a very easy way to do this but I have looked all over and can not find a solution. The logic is simple: find the amount of overlapping minutes given two DatePeriods.For example,-I have $startDate1 and $endDate1 as the first date range.-I have $startDate2 and $endDate2 as the second date range.(For demonstration sake, the format is 'Y-m-d H:i'. )Suppose $startDate1 = '2015-09-11 09:15' and $endDate1 = '2015-09-13 11:30'.Suppose $startDate2 = '2015-09-13 10:45' and $endDate2 = '2015-09-14 12:00'.I would expect a result of 45 minutes overlap. How can this be achieved?I have seen this done using two DateTimes but that is not what I'm looking for.A datePeriod consists of two DateTimes and I'm looking for the difference between two DatePeriods. <code> ",Return the amount of overlapping minutes between two PHP DatePeriods

Have the Sandbox of an API write to a temporary folder in PHP," EDIT 1This question involves the user of the MANGOPAY API. My problem is that I cannot get the API to write to the tmp folder. I have succeeded in getting the API to write to http://fakedomain.com/apifolder/blank.txt and getting the appropriate output. I then ran the script http://fake.com/apifolder/demos/iswrite.php on http://fakedomain.com/apifolder/blank.txt to have minimal working code I could test on the tmp folder. Here is the code in the script: It gives me the outputThe file blank.txt existsThe file is writableso all good there. I created the following file with the following permissions using Filezilla:In the script http://fake.com/apifolder/demos/iswrite.php I have changed the filename variable to $filename = 'http://fake.com/tmp/creative/blank.txt';. It gives me the following output:The file http://fake.com/tmp/creative/blank.txt does not existThe file is not writableAlso, allow_url_fopen is on. I don't fully understand URL structures, so maybe the problem lies there? The tmp folder I am trying to access is on the same level as my public_html folder. Maybe I am writing my URLs wrong?Put in another way, does the tmp folder have to be outside the public_html folder? Would there be any purpose to this? Or can I have create my own tmp folder within public_html where it is already working? ORIGINAL QUESTIONThe original question was poorly written. Please see EDIT 1I am playing with the sandbox of an API (MangoPay). I have included my ClientId and ClientPassword which seems to work. The API also says... You also need to set a folder path in $api->Config->TemporaryFolder that SDK needs to store temporary files. This path should be outside your www folder.

Inserted ID prestashop," I am trying to create a script that automatically imports a XML file, I got this working, but for a reason I need to get the ID from a category I am adding, this category ID is auto increment, so there is no way I could get this out of the existing data.So my code looks like this: I have read somewhere here on stackoverflow that $category->id = Db::getInstance()->Insert_ID();Should do the trick. Unfortunately, this returns always zero. Can someone see what I did wrong?Edit: I am using prestashop version 1.6Edit: Answer:You don't need ""Db::getInstance()->Insert_ID();"" after $object->add() there is already an ID generated, the only thing you have to do is: echo $object->id; and you'll see your ID.Best regards,Evert Arends  <code>  $category = new Category; $category->active = 1; $category->id_parent = 3; $category->name[1] = $product->category_name;; $category->link_rewrite[1] = Tools::link_rewrite($product_xml->category_name); echo ""<br />name of new category = $product->category_name <br /> <br />""; $category->add(); $category->id = Db::getInstance()->Insert_ID();",How to retrieve inserted ID after using add() on an Object?
Why laravel model to have duplicated set of data and how (if possible) to have only one set of data?," It is convenient that laravel model provides a method that it can return results from another associated table.For example, I have a table called item and another table called feedback, where the feedback table stores feedback of an item in the item table. So, to get the all feedback of item with id 1, I will do: And the following this the printout of the object returned. It works fine, and it shows that there is only one feedback on item with id 1. What concerns me is that the dataset is duplicated in [attributes:protected] and [original:protected]. This is just a testing case and the real case will consist of thousands of feedback and having a duplicated dataset is a huge waste of memory. The dataset is not duplicated if I am using the DB::table('table_name') approach, but that is much less convenient. Why does laravel need to duplicate the data in model? And is there a way to make it return only one set of data?Currently I am using ->toArray() to trim down the unnecessary data right after the query, but the memory usage is still there because laravel is still creating that set of data. <code>  Item::find(1)->feedback; Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection Object( [items:protected] => Array ( [0] => Feedback Object ( [table:protected] => feedback [connection:protected] => [primaryKey:protected] => id [perPage:protected] => 15 [incrementing] => 1 [timestamps] => 1 [attributes:protected] => Array ( [id] => 1 [rma_id] => 3 [item_id] => 8 [quo_id] => 0 [case_id] => i2eM20160120 [line_no] => 000001 [content] => test [status] => sent [read] => 0 [sender] => Tester [created_at] => 2016-01-20 18:03:44 [updated_at] => 2016-01-20 18:03:44 ) [original:protected] => Array ( [id] => 1 [rma_id] => 3 [item_id] => 8 [quo_id] => 0 [case_id] => i2eM20160120 [line_no] => 000001 [content] => test [status] => sent [read] => 0 [sender] => Tester [created_at] => 2016-01-20 18:03:44 [updated_at] => 2016-01-20 18:03:44 ) [relations:protected] => Array ( ) [hidden:protected] => Array ( ) [visible:protected] => Array ( ) [appends:protected] => Array ( ) [fillable:protected] => Array ( ) [guarded:protected] => Array ( [0] => * ) [dates:protected] => Array ( ) [touches:protected] => Array ( ) [observables:protected] => Array ( ) [with:protected] => Array ( ) [morphClass:protected] => [exists] => 1 ) ))",Why laravel model duplicates set of data and how (if possible) to have only one set of data?

Fall back to begining of string in RegEx in PHP," Is it possible to have a RegEx fall back to the beginning of the string and begin matching again?Here's why I ask.

I was hoping that something like ^.*(?=(black))^.*(?=(red))^.*(?=(blue))^.*(?=(green)) would work but of course the ^ and lookaheads do not behave this way.Is it possible to construct such a RegEx?For context, I'll be using the RegEx in PHP. <code>  'blue-ka93-red-kdke3-green-weifk-black''green-ka93-red-kdke3-blue-weifk-black''blue-ka93-black-kdke3-green-weifk-red''green-ka93-black-kdke3-blue-weifk-red'",Fall back to begining of string in RegEx

Unwanted securities in Request Class : Laravel 5.2," I am today in bit confusion about my website security and some extra code that is written to make the website secure. Below are 2 locations where security is applied.Inside Route Config, To secure the route, I have used Middleware to check the user role. I mentioned 2 Middlewares. Auth Middleware : This is for authentication. SuperAdmin Middleware: This is for Authorization. Second location is Request class. Here is the code. In authorize method, again same thing is being checked as already done in route Question: Should I remove check in Request class? Is that an unwanted validation to secure the request ? As route.config is already doing the job.What's the use of authorize method? I meant, I am using Request class to validate form inputs. Should I always return true from authorize method? <code>  Route::group(['middleware' => ['web', 'SuperAdmin', 'auth']], function () { Route::get('/Create-Department', 'DepartmentController@CreateDepartment');}); class DepartmentRequest extends Request{ public function authorize() { if(\Auth::user() == null) { return false; } if(\Auth::user()->isSuperAdmin()) { return true; } return false; } public function rules() { return [ 'Department' => 'required', ]; }}",What is the purpose of the authorize method in a Request class in Laravel?

Yii2. Adding attribute and rule dinamically to model," I am writing a widget and I want to avoid user adding code to their model (I know it would be easier but using it to learn something new).Do you know if it is possible to add an attribute (which is not in your database, so it will be virtual) to a model and add a rule for that attribute?. You have no access to change that model code.I know rules is an array. In the past I have merged rules from parent class using array_merge. Can it be done externally? Does Yii2 has a method for that?An idea is to extend model provided by the user with a ""model"" inside my widget an there use: But If I extend it, when I use that model in an ActiveForm in example for a checkbox, it will use my ""CustomModel"", so I want to avoid that. Any other ideas? How to do it without extending their model? <code>  public function init() { /*Since it is extended this not even would be necessary, I could declare the attribute as usual*/ $attribute = ""categories""; $this->{$attribute} = null; //To create attribute on the fly parent::init(); } public function rules() { $rules = [...]; //Then here merge parent rules with mine. return array_merge(parent::rules, $rules); }",Yii2.

Laravel: How can i change the default Auth Password field name," I am currently working on my first laravel project and I am facing a problem.If you have experience with laravel you probably know that by calling php artisan make:auth you will get a predefined mechanism that handles login and registration.This mechanism is set to understand a couple of commonly used words in order to automate the whole procedure.The problem that occurs in my case is that I am using oracle db and it won't let me have a table column with the name of password because its a system keyword and it throws errors when trying to insert a user.So far, I have tried to change my password column to passwd and it worked in my registration form as expected. The User row was successfully inserted and my page was redirected to /home.But when I try to logout and then relogin, I get this error telling me that my credentials are not correct:As for my code, I have changed my RegisterController.php so that it takes username instead of email The User $fillable I am guessing that Auth is trying to authenticate with email and not username or that Auth is searching for password and not passwd. <code>  protected function validator(array $data){ return Validator::make($data, [ 'username' => 'required|max:50|unique:ECON_USERS', 'passwd' => 'required|min:6|confirmed', ]);}protected function create(array $data){ return User::create([ 'username' => $data['username'], 'passwd' => bcrypt($data['passwd']) ]);} protected $fillable = [ 'username', 'passwd'];",Laravel: How can I change the default Auth Password field name?

Difference between use & include in Twig," What is the difference between use and include in Twig?Documentation: include The include statement includes a template and returns the rendered content of that template into the current one: use The use statement tells Twig to import the blocks defined in blocks.html into the current template (it's like macros, but for blocks): blocks.html main.html Possible answer:I think this should explain the difference: include is to get all the code from an external file and import it into your actual file at the right location of the call. use is completely different as it parses the linked file to find a particular section of code and then overwrites the blocks with the same name, in your current file, with the one found in this external file. include is like ""go find this file and render it with my page here"". use is ""parse this other file to find block definitions to use instead of my owns defined here"". If use command finds nothing matching the task, nothing is displayed at all from this file.Questionis the explanation correct? are there any other explanations to this difference? <code>  {% include 'header.html' %}Body here...{% include 'footer.html' %} {% block sidebar %}{% endblock %} {% extends ""base.html"" %}{% use ""blocks.html"" %}{% block title %}{% endblock %}{% block content %}{% endblock %}","Difference between Include, Extends, Use, Macro, Embed in Twig"

My site has internal messaging system and I want to notify users that new message or activity has happened in my site. In this way users would not have to check my site every day for activity which is important user experience as I expect rare activity(approx. few activities per week).I have everything running but after user clicks on notification he is taken to canvas app. FB docs and tutorials focuses on code examples but I have not found anywhere description on what canvas app really is. Without this fundamental understanding I can not complete my notification logic, can not understand the terms involved like ""secure canvas url"" and basically does not feel confident about user experience(which I would want to make as great as possible).If I google ""what is facebook canvas app"" I get ""Canvas is an immersive and expressive experience on Facebook for businesses to tell their stories and showcase their products."". Apparently from comment below thats something else...I would appreacite If someone could explain in plain word and maybe example what is canvas app and how should I use if taking into account that my main goal is to notify users about acitivity in my site to their fb account.

Unicode charCodeAt equivalent in PHP," I have a simple code in JS that I can't replicate in PHP if it comes to special characters.This is the JS code (see JSFiddle for output): The first problem is that PHP strlen() and mb_strlen() already gives different results from JS (strlen: 39, mb_strlen: 11), however I managed to get the same with a custom JS_StringLength function (thanks to this SO answer). Here is what I have in PHP so far (see phpFiddle for output): After a full day of Googling, and trying out everything I found, nothing gave the same results as JS. What should JS_charCodeAt be to get the same output as JS with similar performance?Experimenting #1:Enter my string into https://r12a.github.io/app-conversion/ (awesome stuff). Looks like JS works with UTF-16 code units (19) and PHP strlen counts UTF-8 code units (39). Experimenting #2:When using json_encode() on my string - of course - the result will almost be something like that, what JavaScript may uses. I even examined the original PHP source code of json_encode and how json_encode escapes strings, but.. well..Before flagging as a duplicate, please make sure you test a solution with the string in the above examples (or random emojis) as ALL the charCodeAt implementations found here on stackoverflow are working with most of the special characters, but NOT with emojis. <code>  var str = ""t""; //char ""t"" and special characters, emojis, etc..document.write(""Length is: ""+str.length); // Length is: 19for(var i=0; i<str.length; i++) { document.write(""<br> charCodeAt("" + i + ""): "" + str.charCodeAt(i));} <?phpfunction JS_StringLength($string) { return strlen(iconv('UTF-8', 'UTF-16LE', $string)) / 2;}function JS_charCodeAt($str, $index){ //not working! $char = mb_substr($str, $index, 1, 'UTF-8'); if (mb_check_encoding($char, 'UTF-8')) { $ret = mb_convert_encoding($char, 'UTF-32BE', 'UTF-8'); return hexdec(bin2hex($ret)); } else { return null; }}$str = ""t"";echo $str.""\n"";//echo ""Length is: "".strlen($str).""\n""; //wrongecho ""Length is: "".JS_StringLength($str).""\n""; //OKfor($i=0; $i<JS_StringLength($str); $i++) { echo ""charCodeAt("".$i.""): "".JS_charCodeAt($str, $i).""\n"";}",JS charCodeAt equivalent in PHP (with full unicode and emoji compatibility)

PHP 7 inconsistently throwing errors," I am currently trying to understand the behavior of the new error handling in PHP 7.In the PHP Documentation for DivisionByZeroError, it states: DivisionByZeroError is thrown when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero.Fair enough, but it does not throw the DivisionByZeroError when the / operator is used.In this example, I would expect both errors to be caught: Instead only the first one is caught: Caught DivisionByZeroError! PHP Warning: Division by zero in TypeError.php on line 9...Why? Are there other cases like this? My understanding is that if you catch Throwable you will catch anything that can be raised, which would make PHP error handling a bit more manageable. But in this case, if I use the / operator, it is the uncatchable PHP warning.Is this specific to this error (and maybe because it was triggered by an operator), or am I misunderstanding the change in error handling? <code>  declare(strict_types=1);function usesIntDiv(int $a, int $b) { return intdiv($a,$b);}function divide(int $a, int $b) { return $a / $b;}try { echo usesIntDiv(2,0);} catch (DivisionByZeroError $e) { echo ""Caught DivisionByZeroError!\n"";}echo ""\n"";try { echo divide(2,0);} catch (DivisionByZeroError $e) { echo ""Caught DivisionByZeroError!\n"";}",PHP 7 inconsistently throwing errors for division by zero

Examine character at end of line or before whitespace," I currently have two arrays set up, and I am trying to examine the last two letters in a word and replace it with other characters if there is a match with the first array. I currently have it working to do this to the end of the line, but I cannot figure out how to do this for words that are not at the end of a line.The following is an example of what my arrays might look like. These are populated from a database query. The characters could be any Unicode character, so not necessarily in the range from A-Z or a-z. My current code looks like this: What I have working:So, the code I currently have looks at the last two characters in the string. If the last two characters are ""mp"" for example it replaces them with ""MAP"". So if my string looks like: it gets changed correctly to up to this point everything is working correctly.The problemThe issue I am having is dealing with the words that are not at the end of a string. For example: should be replaced with I want to be able to account for all white space including spaces, tabs, and carriage returns. However, the whitespace must remain intact and not changed. Spaces must stay as spaces, tabs as tabs, and carriage returns as carriage returns.So far, I've been able to figure out that I likely need to use a regular expression using the \s escape character to account for whitespace. However, I cannot comprehend how to use this with the str_replace functions which are acting on the arrays. Is there a way to do this? If not, what else should I do to get this to work? <code>  $array1 = ['mp', 'tm', 'de', 'HK'];$array2 = ['MAP', 'TM', ""DECIMAL"", '']; $mystring = ""samplemp"";$last = substr($mystring, -2);$newlast = str_replace($array1, $array2, $last);if ($last != $newlast){ $mystring = substr($mystr, 0, 2).$newlast;} samplemp sampleMAP samplemp okay de hellotmblatm theHK end sampleMAP okay DECIMAL helloTMblaTM the end",Examine and replace characters at end of line or before whitespace

EXTJS CRSF protection," I am trying to implement protection in one app against CSRF.In PHP it is relatively simple to implement. I have many questions about how to do it with Extjs. The EXTJS books I read do not address the subject and I can not find concrete guidance on this subject - with EXTJS - on the internet.Some questions:Using PHP, the token is sent to the EXTJS?Do I have to create a hidden field in every form as in PHP?Do I have to send to the server side the token in an Ext.Ajax.requestt? How to do this?Some very simple code as a starting point:class Token: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VflbINBabc4 Query I would appreciate help to understand in detail how to implement this type of protection, using the code above as an example.Thanks in advance.Some useful posts:CSRF prevention for AJAX call from extjs to Struts actionHow to implement CSRFGuard in ExtJs AjaxRequest?ExtJS Store SYNC with Spring Security ONhttp://blog.gugl.org/archives/category/extjsEDITEDOne possibility I like is to send the token on every Ajax request: https://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?134125Mabe in Aplication.js. file OR from Building Applications with EXT JS video publish by PACKT, but with node in serverside I still have doubts about how to properly relate the server side (generate the token and do the respective check) with the client side.EDITEDI have made several attempts in the last few days to run the CSRFProtector with php and EXTJS.From the analysis carried out I was able to verify the following with Chrome Dev Tools:If just at de beginning of the file index I add (and not in the other php files): I get on Chrome Dev Tools:csrfprotector.js file is loadedIn loaded php files I have Method: POST, Status 200, Type xhr, Initiator csrfprotector.js:259I see that the data (in JSON format) and a token are sent and Request Headers as a Cookie with the same tokenIn the index.php file, in addition, the following is created, as expected: No error is returnedWhen I add at the beginning of the php file (containing the query that will receive the data of the request, for example to create a record) the include_one and csrfProtector::init() the request is made, success is false and I get a status code 403 and the message 403 Access Forbidden by CSRFProtector!If I add an echo 'Test 1', before csrfProtector::init (); and an echo 'Test 2' after, just first echo works. So it's not a problem in my php code but in validation with csrfprotector.In Dev Tools you see that error 403 is triggered by mentioning the following script line: csrfprotector: 259.line 259 of that file is: return this.old_send (data);I'm going to explore the possible incompatibility of csrfprotector with JSON.If we were able to run the CSRFProtector with PHP and EXTJS (with JSON), it would be a solution that could make all the difference for many, as it is very easy to implement.Example of the data format received on the server-side: <code>  <?php class Token { public static function generate() { $_SESSION['token'] = base64_encode(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32)); } public static function check($token) { if(isset($_SESSION['token']) && $token === $_SESSION['token']){ unset($_SESSION['token']); return true; } return false; }}?> <?phprequire('conect.php');require_once('token.php');$action = $_REQUEST['action'];switch($action){ case ""create"":{ $records = $_POST['records']; $data = json_decode(stripslashes($records)); if(isset($_POST['cars'], $_POST['token'])){ $cars = $data->{'cars'}; if(Token::check($_POST['token'])){ $sqlQuery = ""INSERT INTO the_cars (cars) VALUES (?)""; if($statement = $con->prepare($sqlQuery)){ $statement->bind_param(""s"", $cars); $statement->execute(); $success= true; }else{ $erro = $con->error; $success = false; } }else{ //error } echo json_encode(array( ""success"" => $sucess, 'errors'=> $erro )); $statement->close(); $conexao->close(); break; } }?> init: function () { Ext.require([""Ext.util.Cookies"", ""Ext.Ajax""], function(){ // Add csrf token to every ajax request var token = Ext.util.Cookies.get('csrftoken'); if(!token){ Ext.Error.raise(""Missing csrftoken cookie""); } else { Ext.Ajax.defaultHeaders = Ext.apply(Ext.Ajax.defaultHeaders || {}, { 'X-CSRFToken': token }); } });} var csrfToken = Ext.query('meta[name=csrf-token]')[0].getAttribute('content');Ext.Ajax.defaultHeaders = ('X-CSRF-Token': csrfToken);Ext.Ajax.extraParams = {'csrf': csrfToken}; include_once __DIR__ .'csrfp/libs/csrf/csrfprotector.php';csrfProtector::init() (...) <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://my_path/csrfp/js/csrfprotector.js""></script> <script type=""text/javascript""> window.onload = function() { csrfprotector_init(); }; </script> </body> </html> Array( [action] => create [_dc] => 1505398990654 [data] => {""id_cars"":""id_1"",""cars"":""test""},)",EXTJS CSRF protection

"Using PHP Faker to generate ""unique with"" entry"," So Similar to the unique with validation rule (See: https://github.com/felixkiss/uniquewith-validator), I want to know how to generate a entry, where one column is unique with another one. I want to seed my database as follows.Example:There are 12 steps in the ""steps"" table. Each step should have 5 categories associated with each one that are stored in the ""step_categories"" table. Each of those categories are assigned a unique order number 1 through 5 that is unique with each ""step_id"".See this image here for an example of what the database should look like: https://imgur.com/a/XYA5yynI had to manually to make the entries in the database for the above image example. I don't want to have to generate this manually every time, say I make a mistake and have to rollback the migrations for example.I am using a factory to generate this data. So the factory name is StepCategoriesFactory.php and clearly I'm calling the factory with the create() method from the DatabaseSeeder.php file.I thought about doing this in a for loop, then i got as far as realizing when i called the 'step_id' => App\Model::all()->random()->id to grab a new id, that I wouldn't be able to ensure I wasn't grabbing the id that i just generated 5 entries for. I'm really new with Laravel, and I'm not sure where to even start on this. There's no real information on SO where faker can use the unique with another column. How would I Go about this?NOTE: The step id is not always going to be 1-12. The step ID might be different depending on whether a step gets deleted and remade. So just assigning the step_id to equal 1-12 wont work.UPDATE: Here's some code I just wrote, and I think I'm on the right track. Maybe. I've grabbed the step_id by it's number field as that will always be 1-12, and I've grabbed the IID out of the entry. But now I'm stuck on how to generate the order 1-5 without repeating itself. I still haven't run this yet as its incomplete and I know it'll throw an error without the correct order number.UPDATE 2: I think I'm on the right track here. However I'm getting an undefined variable error. When I put the first line from within the anonymous function, it's resetting the order to ""1"" for every entry. How do i make the $autoIncrement variable available to the anonymous function? The Seeder has stayed the same between updates.Image of the error: https://imgur.com/a/ywkd0LbSecond image with the Die/Dump error in terminal: https://imgur.com/a/rOGRv32Reference this article here: https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/laravel/model-factory-increment-value-faker?page=1UPDATE 3: I forgot the use ($autoIncrement) line of code for the anonymous function. Code below has been updated, but now I'm getting a different error saying that the order column has a null value and can't be inserted. clearly it should be '1'. Even after I call my $autoIncrement->next(); which should increment it to '1' it's still returning null according to the terminal. However, when I do a diedump on $autoIncrement->current() it's returning 1. Weird.Update 3 error: https://imgur.com/a/STOmIjFStepCategoriesFactory.php Edit: Put a bounty on this question, as I think it would be helpful for the community to get a detailed answer. I'm looking for help to explain how to go about making sure I'm grabbing the same entry through each loop. <code>  use Faker\Generator as Faker;$autoIncrement = autoIncrement();$factory->define(App\StepCategory::class, function (Faker $faker) use ($autoIncrement) { // Generate Created At and Updated at DATETIME $DateTime = $faker->dateTime($max = 'now'); $autoIncrement->next(); $order = (int) $autoIncrement->current(); return [ // Generate Dummy Data 'order' => $order, 'name' => $faker->words(4, true), 'created_at' => $DateTime, 'updated_at' => $DateTime, ];});function autoIncrement(){ for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) { yield $i; }}","Using PHP Faker in Laravel to generate ""unique with"" entry when seeding a database using a factory"

Web framework object oriented architecture question," In most of the frameworks you have model classes that represents row in the database.For example php code: I'm giving Laravel eloquent example but this is true for most php frameworks.Then you add the relationships in the class: Then you add some methods like this: My first question is: Is this good design architecture because after years when the project becomes large you will have many relationships (pictures, comments, posts, subscriptions, etc connected to the user).The class could become 10k lines of code or so.In that case, the class will become very large and hard to maintain.Also the Single Responsible Principle maybe is violated because you have too many methods in one class.Also if I want to use the class it in another app I cannot, simply because I'll have to pull also the pictures, comments and etc in the second application(website).If I make other classes like ""UserPictures"", ""UserPictureDeleter"" the code will get more complicated.So is this good practice and if not do you have any suggestions on how to make the code not bloated with so many methods but easy to use.Do you agree that all these methods belong to the User class? <code>  class User extends Model {} public function pictures(){ return $this->hasMany('App\Picture');} public function deleteComments(){ // delete comments code here}",Design problems of ActiveRecord for large application

Proper Way to CLI PHP within WAMP (WAMP64) with Multiple Versions on Windows 10," Used to just put the wamp php directory in my system environment variables as answered here: command line locally using wamp. Which more or less is a very simple environmental variable edit adding the WAMP servers PHP Path, such as ;C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.6.40I'm now learning with more recent versions WAMP is recommending against doing so (as shown here: How To Run PHP From Windows Command Line in WAMPServer).In that answer it shows a clever command line/.cmd program named phppath.cmd which is tailored to linux users.Unedited, it looks as such: This sounds great, but I'm having mild success with it.How it works, is I place the phppath.cmd file into my Windows directory and it autoloads when windows starts.The linux-windows conversions may have messed with me a little bit, but here's my edited output for Windows 10 WAMP64 (current one in my C:\Windows folder) Here's where my confusion is setting in.Using the command prompt phppath in a command line I get the following output Additionally I cannot change my PHP version using the phppath command line.The versions on my WAMP64 installation consist of 5.6.40 - 7.0.33 - 7.1.26 - 7.2.14 - 7.3.1What I am trying to do (and though phppath.cmd would achieve that), is, as seen in that thread, change php CLI versions with a simple command. phppath 5.6.40 phppath 7.0.33 etcbut these commands are ineffective, they process properly, put the command line always states PHP 7.1.26 (cli) no matter if its specified.Did I mess up my paths or something when I tried to convert the above script from linux to Windows 10? I tried to make sure all the paths were appropriate.edit: Using W10 x64 version WAMP 3.1.7. Read there were issues using Powershell, or rather phppath.cmd was not designed for powershell, so I'm using the program Cmder for command line functions.edit 2: Figured out php 7.1.26 was indeed in my environmental variables.. I was only looking at USER env variables. Somehow it got into SYSTEM env variables (not completely sure how). Deleted that entry which may have been causing conflicts. Onto some more testing..Now to just get phppath.cmd to work properly.edit3: Last edit for now.. I'll try to mess with this more later, if anyone has any insight please provide! So as I stated the wamp php directory was in the system environmental variables, once I removed that entry the error message [ERROR C:/wamp64 or PHP in path.] in WAMP went away.As to switch / change between PHP CLI versions -- as of right now, kind of a band-aid solution, but workable... if I just change my phppath.cmd file in my C:\Windows folder from set defaultPHPver=7.1.26 to another version like set defaultPHPver=7.0.33 or set defaultPHPver=5.6.40 --- that works to change the PHP CLI version using phppath on the commandline (AFTER a restart).How it appears to be working is...(manually set defaultpath in cmd file...)...Open up a CLI like cmdertype in.. phppath(here I have in my phppath.cmd a default version of 7.0.x) Then I can continue to use the default php CLI functions.. Current version is PHP 7.0.33Note: If I don't initiate by using the command phppath first I get the typical error message -- 'php' is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file., so typing phppath is required for the php commands to work.So this is great and workable for now. I just have to manually edit the phppath.cmd to the default version I want it to be and reset my computer.Only issue is that, per the instructions, phppath.cmd should be able to change PHP CLI version on the fly using the commands I attempted above. This is of course better than having to manually edit the .cmd file and restart everytime I want to change the version.Anyone have any insight as to why my Windows 10 modified phppath.cmd won't change versions via the command line, only by modifying the file and doing a computer restart? Would be much appreciated... last step to get down :)edit: The comments got kind of long, to summarize defining %PATH% as pathBak was indeed the answer, as shown in @michael_heath Using the script below works exactly as it should on my Windows 10 machine, version changing and all. <code>  @echo offREM **************************************************************REM * PLACE This file in a folder that is already on your PATHREM * Or just put it in your C:\Windows folder as that is on theREM * Search path by defaultREM * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -REM * EDIT THE NEXT 3 Parameters to fit your installed WAMPServerREM **************************************************************set baseWamp=D:\wampset defaultPHPver=7.1.9set composerInstalled=%baseWamp%\composerset phpFolder=\bin\php\phpif %1.==.

Deprecation warnings after upgranding Symfont 4.3.9 to 4.4.1," I had a deprecation-free Symfony 3.4.9 installation. So I upgraded the FW to 4.1.1. Now I got 9 deprecation warnings all coming from vendor libraries:Creating Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\UnderscoreNamingStrategy without making it number aware is deprecated and will be removed in Doctrine ORM 3.0.The ""Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\EventListener\ExceptionListener"" class is deprecated since Symfony 4.4, use ""ErrorListener"" instead.The Doctrine\Common\Persistence\Mapping\AbstractClassMetadataFactory class is deprecated since doctrine/persistence 1.3 and will be removed in 2.0.

Use \Doctrine\Persistence\Mapping\RuntimeReflectionService instead.The Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager class is deprecated since doctrine/persistence 1.3 and will be removed in 2.0.

Use \Doctrine\Persistence\PropertyChangedListener instead.The ""twig.exception_controller"" configuration key has been deprecated in Symfony 4.4, set it to ""null"" and use ""framework.error_controller"" configuration key instead. (x2)Is this ""normal"" or there is any problems in my composer.json file ? I double checked and can't see any dependency that has any ""fixed"" setting.I even deleted the full vendor folder and downloaded again as I thought there could be any ""garbage"" left, with same result.My composer.json file: EDITI checked installed packages with composer show and see that at least 2 of the installed packages are relevant with the deprecation list above: So I checked the available versions of these packages with composer info doctrine/persistence --all and I saw that it has installed the latest non-dev version: Same for doctrine-orm.

" ,      REDIS   ?"," The Redis service is available on my hosting, and if i connect it for money, it is available only for me, since Redis rises in a separate docker container.But, if i turn it off, then Redis can still be used for free, though server-wide. And here I am connecting to the server-wide Redis: And I see there about 300,000 records of other people's sites. And i can change every record! Like this: That is, someone uses the server-wide Redis and I believe that the user is not aware of the public availability of their data. He just turned on the ""Use Redis"" checkbox somewhere in WordPress.And the question is: is the hosting provider responsible for this? After all, an ordinary user believes that his data is stored only on his server and is available only to him.The technical support response was: everything is ok. But I dont think so, so I ask. <code>  $redis = new Redis ();$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379); $allKeys = $redis->keys('*');echo(count($allKeys)); // ~300000echo ($allKeys[10000]); // some data of some siteecho ($redis->get($allKeys[10000])); // some data of some site $redis->set($allKeys[10000], 0);",Is it normal that I see other's Redis data on shared hosting?
