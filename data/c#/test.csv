How to RedirectToAction in ASP.NET MVC (Preview 4) without losing request data," Using ASP.NET MVC there are situations (such as form submission) that may require a RedirectToAction. One such situation is when you encounter validation errors after a form submission and need to redirect back to the form, but would like the URL to reflect the URL of the form, not the action page it submits to.As I require the form to contain the originally POSTed data, for user convenience, as well as validation purposes, how can I pass the data through the RedirectToAction()? If I use the viewData parameter, my POST parameters will be changed to GET parameters. <code> ",How to RedirectToAction in ASP.NET MVC without losing request data

Anyone know a good workaround for the lack of an enum generic constraint?," What I want to do is something like this: I have enums with combined flagged values. So then I could do: Unfortunately, C#'s generic where constraints have no enum restriction, only class and struct.

Memcached on Windows (x64)," Does anyone know IF, WHEN or HOW I can get Memcached running on a Windows 64bit environment? I'm setting up a new hosting solution and would much prefer to run a 64bit OS, and since it's an ASP.Net MVC solution with SQL Server DB, the OS is either going to be Windows Server 2003 or (hopefully!) 2008.I know that this could spill over into a debate regarding 32bit vs 64bit on servers, but let's just say that my preference is 64bit and that I have some very good reasons.So far, I've tried a number of options and found a bit of help related to getting this up on a 32bit machine (and succeeded I might add), but since the original Windows port is Win32 specific, this is hardly going to help when installing as a service on x64. It also has a dependency on the libevent for which I can only get a Win32 compiled version.I suspect that simply loading all this up in C++ and hitting ""compile"" (for 64bit) wouldn't work, not least because of the intricate differences in 32 and 64bit architectures, but I'm wondering if anyone is working on getting this off the ground? Unfortunately, my expertise lie in managed code (C#) only, otherwise I would try and take this on myself, but I can't believe I'm the only guy out there trying to get memcached running on a 64 bit Windows server....am I?UpdateYes I'm afraid I'm still looking for an answer to this - all my efforts (with my pathetic C++ skills) to make a stable build have failed - I've trashed one server and 3 VM's just trying it out so now I turn to the real experts.Is anyone planning on porting this to 64bit? Or are you really suggesting that I use MS Velocity instead? I shudder at the thought.Update:@Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part.@DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service. Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried.@OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response.

Generic Type Checking," Is there a way to enforce/limit the types that are passed to primitives? (bool, int, string, etc.)Now, I know you can limit the generic type parameter to a type or interface implementation via the where clause. However, this doesn't fit the bill for primitives (AFAIK) because they do not all have a common ground (apart from object before someone says! :P).So, my current thoughts are to just grit my teeth and do a big switch statement and throw an ArgumentException on failure.EDIT 1:Just to clarify:The code definition should be like this: And instantiation: EDIT 2@Jon Limjap - Good point, and something I was already considering. I'm sure there is a generic method that can be used to determine if the type is of a value or reference type.This could be useful in instantly removing a lot of the objects I don't want to deal with (but then you need to worry about the structs that are used such as Size ). Interesting problem no? :)Here it is: Taken from MSDN.I'm curious. Could this be done in .NET 3.x using extension methods? Create an interface, and implement the interface in the extension methods (which would probably be cleaner than a bit fat switch). Plus if you then need to later extend to any lightweight custom types, they can also implement the same interface, with no changes required to the base code.What do you guys think?The sad news is I am working in Framework 2!! :DEDIT 3This was so simple following on from Jon Limjaps Pointer.. So simple I almost want to cry, but it's great because the code works like a charm!So here is what I did (you'll laugh!):Code added to the generic class Then a little utility method to check the type and throw an exception, All that then needs to be done is to call EnforcePrimitiveType() in the classes constructors. Job done! :-)The only downside, it only throws an exception at runtime (obviously) rather than design time. But that's no big deal and could be picked up with utilities like FxCop (which we don't use at work).Special thanks to Jon Limjap on this one! <code>  public class MyClass<GenericType> .... MyClass<bool> = new MyClass<bool>(); // LegalMyClass<string> = new MyClass<string>(); // LegalMyClass<DataSet> = new MyClass<DataSet>(); // IllegalMyClass<RobsFunkyHat> = new MyClass<RobsFunkyHat>(); // Illegal (but looks awesome!) where T: struct bool TypeValid(){ // Get the TypeCode from the Primitive Type TypeCode code = Type.GetTypeCode(typeof(PrimitiveDataType)); // All of the TypeCode Enumeration refer Primitive Types // with the exception of Object and Empty (Null). // Since I am willing to allow Null Types (at this time) // all we need to check for is Object! switch (code) { case TypeCode.Object: return false; default: return true; }} private void EnforcePrimitiveType(){ if (!TypeValid()) throw new InvalidOperationException( ""Unable to Instantiate SimpleMetadata based on the Generic Type of '"" + typeof(PrimitiveDataType).Name + ""' - this Class is Designed to Work with Primitive Data Types Only."");}",Generic type checking
obligatorily function call," I have a ""Status"" class in C#, used like this: You get the idea.All callers of MyFunction should check the returned Status: Lazy callers however can ignore the Status. or Is it possible to make this impossible? e.g. an throw exceptionIn general: is it possible to write a C# class on which you have to call a certain function?In the C++ version of the Status class, I can write a test on some private bool bIsChecked in the destructor and ring some bells when someone doesn't check this instance.What is the equivalent option in C#?I read somewhere that ""You don't want a destructor in your C# class""Is the Dispose method of the IDisposable interface an option?In this case there are no unmanaged resources to free.Additionally, it is not determined when the GC will dispose the object.When it eventually gets disposed, is it still possible to know where and when you ignored that specific Status instance?The ""using"" keyword does help, but again, it is not required for lazy callers. <code>  Status MyFunction(){ if(...) // something bad return new Status(false, ""Something went wrong"") else return new Status(true, ""OK"");} Status myStatus = MyFunction();if ( ! myStatus.IsOK() ) // handle it, show a message,... MyFunction(); // call function and ignore returned Status { Status myStatus = MyFunction(); } // lose all references to myStatus, without calling IsOK() on it",Enforcing required function call
Views in seperate assemblies in ASP.NET MVC," I'm trying to create a webapplication where I want to be able to plug-in separate assemblies. I'm using MVC preview 4 combined with Unity for dependency injection, which I use to create the controllers from my plugin assemblies. I'm using WebForms (default aspx) as my view engine.If I want to use a view, I'm stuck on the ones that are defined in the core project, because of the dynamic compiling of the ASPX part. I'm looking for a proper way to enclose ASPX files in a different assembly, without having to go through the whole deployment step. Am I missing something obvious? Or should I resort to creating my views programmatically?Update: I changed the accepted answer. Even though Dale's answer is very thorough, I went for the solution with a different virtual path provider. It works like a charm, and takes only about 20 lines in code altogether I think. <code> ",Views in separate assemblies in ASP.NET MVC
Generics in c# & accessing the  static members of T," My question concerns c# and how to access Static members ... Well I don't really know how to explain it (which kind of is bad for a question isn't it?) I will just give you some sample code: So thank you guys for your answers (By the way the question is: how would I solve this problem without getting an error). This probably quite an easy question for you!Edit: Thank you all for your answers!Though I think the try - catch phrase is the most elegant, I know from my experience with vb that it can really be a bummer. I used it once and it took about 30 minutes to run a program, which later on only took 2 minutes to compute just because I avoided try - catch.This is why I chose the switch statement as the best answer. It makes the code more complicated but on the other hand I imagine it to be relatively fast and relatively easy to read. (Though I still think there should be a more elegant way ... maybe in the next language I learn)Though if you have some other suggestion I am still waiting (and willing to participate) <code>  Class test<T>{ int method1(Obj Parameter1){ //in here I want to do something which I would explain as T.TryParse(Parameter1); //my problem is that it does not work ... I get an error. //just to explain: if I declare test<int> (with type Integer) //I want my sample code to call int.TryParse().

ASP.NET - asp:xxx Controls versus standard HTML," I'm getting into ASP.NET (C# - I know it doesn't matter for this particular question, but full disclosure and all that), and while I love that the asp:-style controls save me a lot of tedious HTML-crafting, I am often frustrated with certain behaviors. I encountered one last night when working with Master Pages: my <asp:BulletedList ID=""nav"">, when converted into HTML, became <ul id=""ct100_nav"">.There are other issues--I noticed that when you auto-populate a DataGrid, it adds attributes to the resulting table that I don't necessarily want there.I know that there is a certain amount of ""convention over configuration"" that you have to accept when you rely on a framework to take over some of your tedious duties, but the ""conventions"" in these cases aren't so much any established conventions, but rather unnecessary extras. I know why the ID adds the prefix, but I should be able to tweak and turn things like this off, especially since, as a bit of a web standards evangelist, I don't duplicated HTML id's in a single page anyway.So the question here is for those ASP.NET devs more seasoned than I: in your experiences in developing and deploying apps, how do you leverage these controls? Do you find yourself resorting back to hard-coded HTML? Do you use a blend? I don't want to design my HTML around idiosyncratic quirks in these controls, but, if possible, I'd like to leverage them when possible. What's a boy to do? <code> ",Controls versus standard HTML
Conditional formating - percentage to color conversion," What's the easiest way to convert a percentage to a color ranging from Green (100%) to Red (0%), with Yellow for 50%?I'm using plain 32bit RGB - so each component is an integer between 0 and 255. I'm doing this in C#, but I guess for a problem like this the language doesn't really matter that much.Based on Marius and Andy's answers I'm using the following solution: Works perfectly - Only adjustment I had to make from Marius solution was to use 256, as (255 - (percent - 50) * 5.12 yield -1 when 100%, resulting in Yellow for some reason in Silverlight (-1, 255, 0) -> Yellow ... <code>  double red = (percent < 50) ? 255 : 256 - (percent - 50) * 5.12;double green = (percent > 50) ? 255 : percent * 5.12;var color = Color.FromArgb(255, (byte)red, (byte)green, 0);",Conditional formatting -- percentage to color conversion
"What is a good use of lambda expressions, and how can I learn to use them?"," I've read that Lambda Expressions are an incredibly powerful addition to C#, yet I find myself mystified by them.

Very slow compile times on Visual Studio," We are getting very slow compile times, which can take upwards of 20+ minutes on dual core 2GHz, 2G Ram machines.A lot of this is due to the size of our solution which has grown to 70+ projects, as well as VSS which is a bottle neck in itself when you have a lot of files. (swapping out VSS is not an option unfortunately, so I don't want this to descend into a VSS bash)We are looking at merging projects. We are also looking at having multiple solutions to achieve greater separation of concerns and quicker compile times for each element of the application. This I can see will become a DLL hell as we try to keep things in synch.I am interested to know how other teams have dealt with this scaling issue, what do you do when your code base reaches a critical mass that you are wasting half the day watching the status bar deliver compile messages.UPDATEI neglected to mention this is a C# solution. Thanks for all the C++ suggestions, but it's been a few years since I've had to worry about headers.EDIT:Nice suggestions that have helped so far (not saying there aren't other nice suggestions below, just what has helped)New 3GHz laptop - the power of lost utilization works wonders when whinging to managementDisable Anti Virus during compile'Disconnecting' from VSS (actually the network) during compile - I may get us to remove VS-VSS integration altogether and stick to using the VSS UIStill not rip-snorting through a compile, but every bit helps.Orion did mention in a comment that generics may have a play also. From my tests there does appear to be a minimal performance hit, but not high enough to sure - compile times can be inconsistent due to disc activity. Due to time limitations, my tests didn't include as many Generics, or as much code, as would appear in live system, so that may accumulate. I wouldn't avoid using generics where they are supposed to be used, just for compile time performanceWORKAROUNDWe are testing the practice of building new areas of the application in new solutions, importing in the latest dlls as required, them integrating them into the larger solution when we are happy with them.We may also do them same to existing code by creating temporary solutions that just encapsulate the areas we need to work on, and throwing them away after reintegrating the code. We need to weigh up the time it will take to reintegrate this code against the time we gain by not having Rip Van Winkle like experiences with rapid recompiling during development. <code> ",Very slow compile times on Visual Studio 2005

Get external IP address in C#," I need to find out the external IP of the computer a C# application is running on. In the application I have a connection (via .NET remoting) to a server. Is there a good way to get the address of the client on the server side?(I have edited the question, to be a little more clear. I'm apologize to all kind people who did their best to respond to the question, when I perhaps was a little too vague)Solution:I found a way that worked great for me. By implementing a custom IServerChannelSinkProvider and IServerChannelSink where I have access to CommonTransportKeys.IPAddress, it's easy to add the client ip on the CallContext. And then later (when I get a request from a client) just get the IP from the CallContext like this. I can now send the IP back to the client. <code>  public ServerProcessing ProcessMessage(IServerChannelSinkStack sinkStack, IMessage requestmessage, ITransportHeaders requestHeaders, System.IO.Stream requestStream, out IMessage responseMessage, out ITransportHeaders responseHeaders, out System.IO.Stream responseStream){ try { // Get the IP address and add it to the call context. IPAddress ipAddr = (IPAddress)requestHeaders[CommonTransportKeys.IPAddress]; CallContext.SetData(""ClientIP"", ipAddr); } catch (Exception) { } sinkStack.Push(this, null); ServerProcessing srvProc = _NextSink.ProcessMessage(sinkStack, requestmessage, requestHeaders, requestStream, out responseMessage, out responseHeaders, out responseStream); return srvProc;} public string GetClientIP(){ // Get the client IP from the call context. object data = CallContext.GetData(""ClientIP""); // If the data is null or not a string, then return an empty string. if (data == null || !(data is IPAddress)) return string.Empty; // Return the data as a string. return ((IPAddress)data).ToString();}",Get external IP address over remoting in C#
Fastest api for rendering text in WinForms?," We need to optimize the text rendering for a C# Windows Forms application displaying a large number of small strings in an irregular grid. At any time there can be well over 5000 cells visible that update 4 times per second. The font family and size is consistent across the cells, though the color may vary from cell to cell, as will bold/italic/plain.I've seen conflicting information on the web about TextRenderer.DrawText vs. Graphics.DrawString being the fastest/best, which reduces to a GDI vs. GDI+ comparison at the Win32 level. I've also seen radically different results on Windows XP vs. Windows Vista, but my main target is Windows XP.

"What is ""Best Practice"" For Comparing to Instances of a Reference Type?"," I came across this recently, up until now I have been happily overriding the equality operator (==) and/or Equals method in order to see if two references types actually contained the same data (i.e. two different instances that look the same).I have been using this even more since I have been getting more in to automated testing (comparing reference/expected data against that returned).While looking over some of the coding standards guidelines in MSDN I came across an article that advises against it. Now I understand why the article is saying this (because they are not the same instance) but it does not answer the question:What is the best way to compare two reference types?Should we implement IComparable? (I have also seen mention that this should be reserved for value types only).Is there some interface I don't know about?Should we just roll our own?!Many Thanks ^_^UpdateLooks like I had mis-read some of the documentation (it's been a long day) and overriding Equals may be the way to go..If you are implementing referencetypes, you should consider overridingthe Equals method on a reference typeif your type looks like a base typesuch as a Point, String, BigNumber,and so on. Most reference types shouldnot overload the equality operator,even if they override Equals. However,if you are implementing a referencetype that is intended to have valuesemantics, such as a complex numbertype, you should override the equalityoperator. <code> ","What is ""Best Practice"" For Comparing Two Instances of a Reference Type?"

Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.," I have a scenario. (Windows Forms, C#, .NET)There is a main form which hosts some user control.The user control does some heavy data operation, such that if I directly call the UserControl_Load method the UI become nonresponsive for the duration for load method execution.To overcome this I load data on different thread (trying to change existing code as little as I can) I used a background worker thread which will be loading the data and when done will notify the application that it has done its work. Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I'm fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl. The pseudocode would look like this:CODE 1 The Exception it gave was Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following codeCODE 2 BUT BUT BUT... it seems I'm back to square one.

The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned.I don't know whether I perceived this right or wrong. I'm new to threading.How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block?The situation is this: I want to load data into a global variable based on the value of a control.

How do I prevent and/or handle a StackOverflowException? (C#)," I would like to either prevent or handle a StackOverflowException that I am getting from a call to the XslCompiledTransform.Transform method within an Xsl Editor I am writing. The problem seems to be that the user can write an Xsl script that is infinitely recursive, and it just blows up on the call to the Transform method. (That is, the problem is not just the typical programmatic error, which is usually the cause of such an exception.)Is there a way to detect and/or limit how many recursions are allowed?

C# - Optimising binary serialization for multi-dimensional generic arrays," I have a class that I need to binary serialize. The class contains one field as below: These multi-dimensional arrays can be fairly large (hundreds of thousands of elements) and of any primitive type. When I tried standard .net serialization on an object the file written to disk was large and I think .net is storing a lot of repeated data about element types and possibly not as efficiently as could be done.I have looked around for custom serializers but have not seen any that deal with multi-dimensional generic arrays. I have also experimented with built-in .net compression on a byte array of the memory stream following serializing with some success, but not as quick / compressed as I had hoped.My question is, should I try and write a custom serializer to optimally serialize this array for the appropriate type (this seems a little daunting), or should I use standard .net serialization and add compression?Any advice on the best approach would be most appreciated, or links to resources showing how to tackle serialization of a multi-dimensional generic array - as mentioned existing examples I have found do not support such structures. <code>  private T[,] m_data;",Optimising binary serialization for multi-dimensional generic arrays

.NET AppDomain using COM interop problem," Here's the core problem: I have a .NET application that is using COM interop in a separate AppDomain. The COM stuff seems to be loading assemblies back into the default domain, rather than the AppDomain from which the COM stuff is being called.What I want to know is: is this expected behaviour, or am I doing something wrong to cause these COM related assemblies to be loaded in the wrong AppDomain? Please see a more detailed description of the situation below...The application consists of 3 assemblies:- the main EXE, the entry point of the application.- common.dll, containing just an interface IController (in the IPlugin style)- controller.dll, containing a Controller class that implements IController and MarshalByRefObject. This class does all the work and uses COM interop to interact with another application.The relevant part of the main EXE looks like this: The common.dll only contains these 2 things: And the controller.dll contains this class (which also calls the COM interop stuff): When first running the application, Assembly.GetAssemblies() looks as expected, with common.dll being loaded in both AppDomains, and controller.dll only being loaded into the controller domain. After calling c.Run() however I see that assemblies related to the COM interop stuff have been loaded into the default AppDomain, and NOT in the AppDomain from which the COM interop is taking place.Why might this be occurring?And if you're interested, here's a bit of background:Originally this was a 1 AppDomain application. The COM stuff it interfaces with is a server API which is not stable over long periods of use. When a COMException (with no useful diagnostic information as to its cause) occurs from the COM stuff, the entire application has to restarted before the COM connection will work again. Simply reconnecting to the COM app server results in immediate COM exceptions again. To cope with this I have tried to move the COM interop stuff into a seperate AppDomain so that when the mystery COMExceptions occur I can unload the AppDomain in which it occurs, create a new one and start again, all without having to manually restart the application. That was the theory anyway... <code>  AppDomain controller_domain = AppDomain.CreateDomain(""Controller Domain"");IController c = (IController)controller_domain.CreateInstanceFromAndUnwrap(""controller.dll"", ""MyNamespace.Controller"");result = c.Run();AppDomain.Unload(controller_domain); public enum ControllerRunResult{FatalError, Finished, NonFatalError, NotRun}public interface IController{ ControllerRunResult Run();} public class Controller: IController, MarshalByRefObject",Does COM interop respect .NET AppDomain boundaries for assembly loading?

Default string initialization: NULL or Empy?," I have always initialized my strings to NULL, with the thinking that NULL means the absence of a value and """" or String.Empty is a valid value. I have seen more examples lately of code where String.Empty is considered the default value or represents no value. This strikes me as odd, with the newly added nullable types in c# it seems like we are taking strides backwards with strings by not using the NULL to represent 'No Value'.What do you use as the default initializer and why?Edit: Based on the answers I futher my further thoughtsAvoiding error handling If the value shouldn't be null, why did it get set to NULL in the first place? Perhaps it would be better to identify the error at the place where it occurs rather than cover it up through out the rest of your codebase?Avoiding null checks If you are tired of doing null checks in code, wouldn't it be better to abstract the null checks? Perhaps wrap (or extend!) the string methods to make them NULL safe? What happens if you constantly use String.Empty and a null happens to work it's way into your system, do you start adding NULL checks anyways?I can't help but return to the opinion that it is laziness. Any DBA would slap you nine ways to silly if you used '' instead of null in his\her database.

Can a C# program mesaure its own CPU usage somehow?," I am working on a background program that will be running for a long time, and I have a external logging program (SmartInspect) that I want to feed with some values periodically, to monitor it in realtime when debugging.I know I can simply fire up multiple programs, like the Task Manager, or IARSN TaskInfo, but I'd like to keep everything in my own program for this, as I also wants to add some simple rules like if the program uses more than X% CPU, flag this in the log.I have a background thread that periodically feeds some statistics to SmartInspect, like memory consumption, working set, etc.Is it possible for this thread to get a reasonably accurate measure of how much of the computer's CPU resources it consumes? The main program is a single-threaded application (apart from the watchdog thread that logs statistics) so if a technique is limited to how much does a single thread use then that would be good too.I found some entries related to something called rusage for Linux and C. Is there something similar I can use for this?Edit: Ok, I tried the performance counter way, but it added quite a lot of GC-data each time called, so the graph for memory usage and garbage collection skyrocketed.

.Net WinForms Design Time Rules," I have an object that starts a thread, opens a file, and waits for input from other classes. As it receives input, it writes it to disk.

parsing JSon using JSon.net," I'm trying to parse some JSON using the JSon.Net library. The documentation seems a little sparse and I'm confused as to how to accomplish what I need. Here is the format for the JSON I need to parse through. The only data I really need from this is the stuff in the objects array. Is it possible for me to parse through that with something like the JSonTextReader and just pull out the things I want, like OBJECT_TYPE and the x and y position? I can't seem to get JSonTextReader to work the way I want it to and I find little to no examples of usage for it. It seems like serializing first then using LINQ with my object would be ideal and every example I find discusses serializing the JSON first, but I'm not sure how I would build an object for this structure. Particularly the objects array which would need to be something like a list of Pairs of attribute and position objects. I have no idea how I would code my object so JSon.Net would know how to serialize that.I thought I could write my own simple parser to just pull out everything I need into an attributes object that I created, but I'm having little luck. Hopefully this all makes sense, any ideas? <code>  { ""displayFieldName"" : ""OBJECT_NAME"", ""fieldAliases"" : { ""OBJECT_NAME"" : ""OBJECT_NAME"", ""OBJECT_TYPE"" : ""OBJECT_TYPE"" }, ""positionType"" : ""point"", ""reference"" : { ""id"" : 1111 }, ""objects"" : [ { ""attributes"" : { ""OBJECT_NAME"" : ""test name"", ""OBJECT_TYPE"" : ""test type"" }, ""position"" : { ""x"" : 5, ""y"" : 7 } } ]}",Parsing JSON using Json.net

"Delegates and Lambdas and LINQ, Oh My! (A cry for help to Jon Skeet and other C# Gurus)"," As a fairly junior developer, I'm running into a problem that highlights my lack of experience and the holes in my knowledge. Please excuse me if the preamble here is too long.I find myself on a project that involves my needing to learn a number of new (to me) technologies, including LINQ (to OBJECTS and to XML for purposes of this project) among others. Everything I've read to this point suggests that to utilize LINQ I'll need to fully understand the following (Delegates, Anonymous Methods and Lambda Expressions).OK, so now comes the fun. I've CONSUMED delegates in the past as I have worked with the .NET event model, but the majority of the details have been hidden from me (thanks Microsoft!). I understand that on a basic level, delegate instances are pointers to methods (a gross over-simplification, I know).I understand that an anonymous method is essentially an in-line unnamed method generally (if not exclusively) created as a target for a delegate.I also understand that lambdas are used in varying ways to simplfy syntax and can be used to point a simple anonymous method to a delegate.Pardon me if my any of my descriptions are WAY off here, this is the basic level to which I understand these topics.So, the challenge:Can anyone tell me if at least on a basic level if my understanding of these items is even close? I'm not looking for complex esoteric minutiae, just the basics (for now).To what degree do I need to truly understand these concepts before applying LINQ in a project to reasonable effect? I want to understand it fully and am willing to spend the time. I simply may not HAVE the time to fully grok all of this stuff before I need to produce some work.Can anyone point me to some good articles that explain these subjects and apply them to ""real world"" examples so that I can get my head around the basics of the topics and application of them? What I mean by real world, is how might I use this in the context of ""Customers and Invoices"" rather than abstract ""Vectors and Shapes"" or ""Animals and Cows"". The scenario can be somewhat contrived for demonstration purposes, but hopefully not strictly academic. I have found a number of examples on-line and in books, but few seem to be ""Plain English"" explanations.Thank you all in advance for your patience, time and expertise. <code> ","Delegates and Lambdas and LINQ, Oh My!"

What is the fastest way to programatically check the well-formedness of XML files in C#?," I have large batches of XHTML files that are manually updated. During the review phase of the updates I would like to programmatically check the well-formedness of the files.I am currently using a XmlReader, but the time required on an average CPU is much longer than I expected.The XHTML files range in size from 4KB to 40KB and verifying takes several seconds per file. Checking is essential but I would like to keep the time as short as possible as the check is performed while files are being read into the next process step.Is there a faster way of doing a simple XML well-formedness check? Maybe using external XML libraries?I can confirm that validating ""regular"" XML based content is lightning fast using the XmlReader, and as suggested the problem seems to be related to the fact that the XHTML DTD is read each time a file is validated. Note that in addition to the DTD, corresponding .ent files (xhtml-lat1.ent, xhtml-symbol.ent, xhtml-special.ent) are also downloaded.Since ignoring the DTD completely is not really an option for XHTML as the well-formedness is closely linked to allowed HTML entities (e.g., a &nbsp; will promptly introduce validation errors when we ignore the DTD).The problem was solved by using a custom XmlResolver as suggested, in combination with local (embedded) copies of both the DTD and entity files. I will post the solution here once I cleaned up the code <code>  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"">",What is the fastest way to programmatically check the well-formedness of XML files in C#?

Embedding a File Explorer instance in a WinForms app form," My (C#, .NET 3.5) application generates files and, in addition to raising events that can be caught and reacted to, I want to display the target folder to the user in a form. The file-list is being shown within the same form as other information.I'm using an instance of the WebBrowser control (System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser), then navigating to the folder. This shows some default view of the explorer window, with the file summary panel on the left and the files in the 'Tiles' (large icon and text) view.For example, I'd like to suppress the panel and to view the file list in the Details view. The user can get to this via a right-click, context menu, but I'd like it to come up automatically.I'd rather not have to build my own TreeView, DataGridView or whatever; the WebBrowser control does all the updating and re-sorting and whatnot 'for free'.Is there a better way? A different control to use or some additional arguments to pass to the control?And if I could trap events (for example, files being selected/renamed/double-clicked, etc.) then all the better! <code>  wb.Navigate(@""c:\path\to\folder\"");",Embedding a File Explorer instance in a Windows Forms application form
c# pass through mouse events to parent control," Environment: .NET Framework 2.0, VS 2008.I am trying to create a subclass of certain .NET controls (label, panel) that will pass through certain mouse events (MouseDown, MouseMove, MouseUp) to its parent control (or alternatively to the top-level form). I can do this by creating handlers for these events in instances of the standard controls, e.g.: I cannot move the event handler into a subclass of the control, because the methods that raise the events in the parent control are protected and I don't have a qualifier for the parent control: Cannot access protected member System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnMouseDown(System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) via a qualifier of type System.Windows.Forms.Control; the qualifier must be of type TheProject.NoCaptureLabel (or derived from it).I am looking into overriding the WndProc method of the control in my sub-class, but hopefully someone can give me a cleaner solution. <code>  public class TheForm : Form{ private Label theLabel; private void InitializeComponent() { theLabel = new Label(); theLabel.MouseDown += new MouseEventHandler(theLabel_MouseDown); } private void theLabel_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { int xTrans = e.X + this.Location.X; int yTrans = e.Y + this.Location.Y; MouseEventArgs eTrans = new MouseEventArgs(e.Button, e.Clicks, xTrans, yTrans, e.Delta); this.OnMouseDown(eTrans); }}",Pass-through mouse events to parent control

Coding guides: How do you spilt up your large source files?," The project I'm working on has just hit 4200 lines in the main C# file, which is causing IntelliSense to take a few seconds (sometimes up to 6 or so) to respond, during which Visual Studio locks up. I'm wondering how everyone else splits their files and whether there's a consensus.I tried to look for some guides and found Google's C++ guide, but I couldn't see anything about semantics such as function sizes and file sizes; maybe it's there - I haven't looked at it for a while.So how do you split your files? Do you group your methods by the functions they serve? By types (event handlers, private/public)? And at what size limit do you split functions?To clarify, the application in question handles data - so its interface is a big-ass grid, and everything revolves around the grid. It has a few dialogs forms for management, but it's all about the data. The reason why it's so big is that there is a lot of error checking, event handling, and also the grid set up as master-detail with three more grids for each row (but these load on master row expanded). I hope this helps to clarify what I'm on about. <code> ",Coding guides: How do you split up your large source files?

Youtube API integration ASP.net - upload video with a single page," we are trying to use the Google YouTube API to upload videos from our website to YouTube through the browser directly. The API works in two steps, in the first step we need to create an Video object with all the metadata like title,tags,description, category etc. Then we need to send a request with this object to YouTube and get a Token object generated as a response. This token object has a Token Value and a Token URL as its members. In second step they suggest that we should create a Form with the action attribute set to the Token URL. This form should have a file upload control and a hidden field with the Token Value as its value. When this form is posted, it would upload the video to YouTube.This works great if we have it as a two step process, asking users for the metadata first and then redirecting them on to second page for the actual video upload. However, we are trying to accomplish this in a single page, appearing as a single step to the user. We have a MasterPage with the 'aspnetForm' specified in it, because of which we cant have another form with runat='server' property. We have tried modifying the aspnetFrom's action attribute using JavaScript/code-behind but it stays the same, whatever we do.We have also tried to put another nested form, whose action tag would be set on the button click event, after the first response from YouTube with token is received. But even this doesn't work, as the form isn't created at the time this method is called.. We have tried several approaches but none seems to work.. any suggestions on this would be great.If you have any more questions to understand the situation clearly.. please let me know..

The problem is the application is released with ""Any CPU"" as configuration and when a user runs it on a 64 bit windows, the direcX part crashes (System.BadImageFormatException). Apparently the dlls included for the directX part is not usable on a 64 bit windows. This has happened with some other 3:rd part dlls that we use in our application but this we have solved by changing the dlls in runtime to the ones built for x64 if the user are running on a 64 bit windows machine. Do any of you know where I can find DirectX 9 dlls for x64? If they exist at all. The ones I need are:Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3DMicrosoft.DirectX.Direct3DXMicrosoft.DirectXIf they do not exist, can the problem be solved in some other way? I cannot change the configuration to x86 because the application is released via ClickOnce and a change of configuration make ClickOnce stop working (the configuration is included in the ClickOnce key)Let me add that the I am using a Winforms part hosted by the WPF application and that the winforms part is using the DirectX dlls I am asking about. This was a much better and faster way of presenting a lot of 3D meshes in WPF than to use WPF:s 3D. Unfortunately this problem occurred instead. <code> ",DirectX application on 64 bit windows

OnDataBinding vs Inline," I thought I would ask this question to see why many examples and people prefer to use inline databinding in the aspx code vs implementing an OnDataBinding event when using WebForms.For any databound control (eg. Repeater, GridView, etc) I always implement the OnDataBinding method for field level controls if I need to do anything that isn't built in out of the box (eg. I need to do an Eval). Most examples I see have the code right in the aspx page using the inline <%# syntax.Example of inline ASP.NET code: Example of how I prefer to do it:In the aspx: In the codebehind .cs: I personally prefer the codebehind method because it keeps my aspx pages clean and I don't have all this inline code all over the place and the next guy just knows to always look in the .cs files for code changes. The seperation of presentation and code is also maintained better this way as the HTML is place holders only and the codebind is determining what is actually being put in control.Now these are very basic examples. The field could be a integer that you want to format with leading 0s or a DateTime that needs a specific format etc. It could also take all sort of manipulation and code to get the finally value that should be stored in the 'Text' property at the end.Where do you draw the line and move it to the codebehind if you are using inline code?What are the pros and cons for doing it either way?Does one take more overhead than the other?Edit Note: I am not talking about assigning a value to a control that is just on the page but one that is being databound to because it exists in a repeater template or gridview item template etc... Obviously a literal sitting on a page you can just assign in code.Edit Note: I thought I would gather more response, especially with regards to the overhead. Do most people NOT use the OnDataBinding events? <code>  <asp:Literal ID=""litExample"" runat=""server"" Text='<%# Eval(""ExampleField"").ToString() %>' /> <asp:Literal ID=""litExample"" runat=""server"" OnDataBinding=""litExample_DataBinding"" /> protected void litExample_DataBinding(object sender, System.EventArgs e){ Literal lit = (Literal)(sender); lit.Text = string.Format(""{1} - {2}"", Eval(""ExampleField"").ToString(), Eval(""ExampleField2"").ToString());}","OnDataBinding vs Inline: pros, cons and overhead"

I have also tried declaring the filestream separately, removing using, and putting fs.Close() and fs.Dispose() after the read.After this, I commented out the actually md5 computation, and the code excutes, with the file being deleted, so it looks like it's something to do with ComputeHash(fs). <code>  File.Copy(pathSrc, pathDest, true);String md5Result;StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();MD5 md5Hasher = MD5.Create();using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead(pathDest)){ foreach(Byte b in md5Hasher.ComputeHash(fs)) sb.Append(b.ToString(""x2"").ToLower());}md5Result = sb.ToString();File.Delete(pathDest);",C# MD5 hasher example
DrawString weirdness in C# Winforms," I have subclassed a control in C# WinForms, and am custom drawing text in my OnPaint() handler.The font is set to Courier New using the following code in my form: In the control itself, the string is stored in realText, and I use the following code to draw it to the screen: The result for some random example text looks as follows:http://img219.imageshack.us/img219/1778/courier.pngIf you zoom in, you can see for example, that the space between the first 'as' is different than the space between the second 'as' (1 pixels versus 2 pixels).

MSTest: Problems with DeploymentItem attribute," I'm currently maintaining an ""old"" system written in C#.net, removing some obsolete features and doing some refactoring. Thanks god, the previous guy wrote some unit tests (MSTests). I quite comfortable with JUnit tests, but didn't do yet much with MSTests.The test methods have a DeploymentItem attribute, specifying a text file which is parsed by the business logic method that is being tested and a 2nd DeploymentItem where just a path has been specified containing a bunch of TIF files that have to be deployed too. The tests worked before, but now I had to change the names of the TIF files contained in the \files\tif directory. According to a rule, the TIF filenames have to match a certain pattern which is also checked by the ExistsTifTest() method.Now I had to change the filenames in order to adapt them to the new requirements and suddently the TIF files are no more being deployed as before.Can someone give me a hint why this happens or what may be the cause? The same thing happens also if I add a new text-file say ""my2ndTest.txt"" beside the ""valid_entries.txt"" in the \files\valid\ directory with the according DeploymentItem attribute on the test method. The file doesn't get deployed?I got the images now deployed by defining the deployment path directly in the testrunconfig, but I'd like to understand why these things happen or why for instance my new file ""my2ndTest.txt"" doesn't get deployed while the others do. <code>  [TestMethod()][DeploymentItem(@""files\valid\valid_entries.txt"")][DeploymentItem(@""files\tif\"")]public void ExistsTifTest(){ ...}",Problems with DeploymentItem attribute
Return value caching without boilerplate code," For methods where ...there exists a static one-to-one mapping between the input and the output, andthe cost of creating the output object is relatively high, andthe method is called repeatedly with the same input... there is a need for caching result values.In my code the following result value caching pattern is repeated a lot (pseudo-code in Java, but the question is language-agnostic): Repeating this structure all the time is a clear violation of the DRY principle.Ideally, I'd like the code above to be reduced to the following: Where the theoretical CacheResult annotation would take care of the caching I'm currently doing by hand. The general term for this type of caching is ""memoization"".A good example of the exact functionality I'm looking for is Perl core module ""Memoize"".In which languages does such a Memoize-like caching solution exist (either at the language level or the library level)?

Generic .Net Produce/Consumer ," I'm toying with the idea of implementing a generic Producer/Consumer pair + processing queue in C# for fun.

The basic requirements I'm looking for:Use generics for the produced and consumed types (input, queued task, and output types, or any combination thereof)Allow you specify how many consumers will work the queueAllow you to link up or chain multiple queues into a pipeline (tricky with multiple Consumers, I know)Allow you to implement your own Producers and ConsumersAllow you to turn any IEnumerable into a producer (okay if I have to implement that myself, as long it's possible)Delegate based (you can use lambda syntax for the basic consumer or producer work to process a single item)Or if there is none, what pitfalls have prevented it and do you have any thoughts on how to implement it? <code> ",Generic .Net Producer/Consumer

Is there an existing library of extension methods for C#? or share your own.," Possible Duplicate: Post your extension goodies for C# .Net (codeplex.com/extensionoverflow) I'm fond of C# 3.0.

I am being warned that this question is subjective and likely to be closed, but I think it's a good question, because we all have ""boilerplate"" code to do something relatively static like ""escape string for XML"" - but I have yet to find a place to collect these.I'm especially interested in common functions that perform logging/debugging/profiling, string manipulation, and database access.

Datagridview causing IndexOutOfRangeExceptionn when clicked upon," I have a datagridview which we will call dataGridViewExample.My object (the uncommon datatypes is because my database is SQLite): Here is the relevant code: When MyForm gets called with a .ShowDialog, it shows up fine and displays my DataGridView example just fine. As you can read from the code, the ExampleListis initially empty, so it just shows an empty datagridview with 4 columns: Vnr, Name, Price & Amount. If I click inside it etc. nothing happens - so everything is working as planned, so far.Everytime I call AddtoDataGridViewExample() it adds the new object to the Datagridview, and the datagridview does update, listing all the objects added so far (they show themself as rows, again according to plan).Now, remember that I just said that nothing happened if you clicked inside DataGridViewExample before I have called AddtoDataGridViewExample()?Well, after having called AddtoDataGridViewExample() once or more, the program will crash if I click inside DataGridViewExample (for example: the users wants to select a row). It throws an IndexOutOfRangeException and talks about an -1 index.It also throws the exception in the other form, on the line where I call MyForm with .ShowDialog();I really am stuck on this, do you guys have any idea what is wrong?? My only clue is that I do believe the refresh of DataGridViewExample's datasource might be the cause of the problem. Another important note: I have yet bound any events to my DataGridViewExample. So you can rule that idea out.Here is all DataGridViewExample's properties: <code>  class MyObject{ public Int64 Vnr { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public Single Price { get; set; } public int Amount { get; set; }} //This form gets called with a .ShowDialog(); in my form1.private List<MyObjecte> ExampleList = new List<MyObject>();public MyForm(){ dataGridViewExample.DataSource = OrdreInkbsListe;}private void AddtoDataGridViewExample(){ //Add a new MyObject to the list ExampleList.Add(new myObject() { Vnr = newVnr, Amount = newAmount, Price = newPrice, Name = newName }); //refresh datasource dataGridViewExample.DataSource = null; dataGridViewExample.Refresh(); dataGridViewExample.DataSource = OrdreInkbsListe; ddataGridViewExample.Refresh();} this.dataGridViewExample.AllowUserToAddRows = false;this.dataGridViewExample.AllowUserToDeleteRows = false;this.dataGridViewExample.AllowUserToResizeColumns = false;this.dataGridViewExample.AllowUserToResizeRows = false;this.dataGridViewExample.AutoSizeColumnsMode = System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsMode.Fill;this.dataGridViewExample.ColumnHeadersHeightSizeMode = System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumnHeadersHeightSizeMode.AutoSize;this.dataGridViewExample.Location = new System.Drawing.Point(591, 53);this.dataGridViewExample.MultiSelect = false;this.dataGridViewExample.Name = ""dataGridViewExample"";this.dataGridViewExample.ReadOnly = true;this.dataGridViewExample.RowHeadersVisible = false;this.dataGridViewExample.SelectionMode = System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode.FullRowSelect;this.dataGridViewExample.ShowEditingIcon = false;this.dataGridViewExample.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(240, 150);this.dataGridViewExample.TabIndex = 31;",Datagridview causing IndexOutOfRangeException when clicked upon

How to detect if the mouse is inside the whole form and child controls in C#?," I need to detect when the user moves the mouse over the Form and all its child controls and also when it leaves the Form. I tried the MouseEnter and MouseLeave events of the Form, I tried the WM_MOUSEMOVE & WM_MOUSELEAVE and WM_NCMOUSEMOVE & WM_NCMOUSELEAVE pairs of windows messages but none seem to work as I want...Most of my Form is occupied by child controls of many sorts, there's not much client area visible. This means that if I move the mouse very quickly the mouse movement will not be detected, although the mouse is inside the Form.For instance, I have a TextBox that is docked at the bottom and between the desktop and the TextBox, there's only a very small border. If I quickly move the mouse from the bottom into the TextBox, the mouse movement won't be detected, but the mouse is inside the TextBox, therefore, inside the Form.How can I achieve what I need? <code> ",How to detect if the mouse is inside the whole form and child controls?

How does HashSet differ from Set?," Old questionMy understanding is that C# has in some sense HashSet and set types. I understand what HashSet is. But why set is a separate word?

From my point of view, I would like to have a set with standard lookup/addition/deletion performance. I wouldn't care much whether it is realized with hashes or something else. So why not make a set class that would actually be implemented as a HashSet in this version of C# but perhaps somewhat different in a future version?Or why not at least interface ISet?AnswerLearned thanks to everyone who answered below: ICollection implements a lot of what you'd expect from ISet. From my point of view, though, ICollection implements IEnumerable while sets don't have to be enumerable --- example: set of real numbers between 1 and 2 (even more, sets can be generated dynamically). I agree this is a minor rant, as 'normal programmers' rarely need uncountable sets.Ok, I think I get it. HashSet was absolutely meant to be called Set but the word Set is reserved in some sense. More specifically, creators of .NET architecture wanted to have a consistent set (sic!) of classes for different languages. This means that every name of the standard class must not coincide with any keyword in the .NET languages. The word Set, however, is used in VB.NET which is actually case-insensitive (is it?) so unfortunately there is no room for maneuvre there.Mystery solved :)EpilogueThe new answer by Alex Y. links to the MSDN page which describes the upcoming .NET 4.0 interface ISet which behaves pretty much as I thought it should and is implemented by HashedSet.

Automatic files uploading," UPDATEDSee post #3 below.There is a need to upload a file to the web automatically (without browser). Host - Mini File Host v1.2 (if this does matter). Didn't find specific api in documentation, so at first i sniffed browser requests in Firebug as follows : Here we can see parameter, headers, content type and chunks of information (1 - file name and type, 2 - file contents, 3 - additional params - description and password, not necessarily applied).So i've created a class that emulates such a behaviour step by step : HttpWebRequest on the url, apply needed parameters to request, form request strings with StringBuilder and convert them to byte arrays, read a file using FileStream, putting all that stuff to MemoryStream and then writing it to request (took major part of a code from an article at CodeProject where it uploads a file to Rapidshare host). Neat and tidy, but... It doesn't seem to work :(. As result it returns initial upload page, not a result page with links i could parse and present to a user... Here are main methods of an Uploader class : Plays with ProtocolVersion (1.0, 1.1), AllowAutoRedirect (true/false), even known ServicePoint.Expect100Continue (false) didn't fix an issue.

MD5 Encryption Given a Key in C#," I've been looking for a way to hash a given string in C# that uses a predetermined key. On my adventures through the internet trying to find an example i have seen lots of MD5CryptoServiceProvider examples which seem to use a default key for the machine, but none of them that apply a specific key. I need to have a specific key to encode data as to synchronize it to someone else's server. I hand them a hashed string and an ID number and they use that analyze the data and return a similar set to me. So is there anyway to get md5 to hash via a specific key that would be consistent to both.I would prefer this to be done in C#, but if its not possible with the libraries can you do so with some web languages like php or asp?Edit: Misunderstood the scenario I was thrown into and after a little sitting and thinking about why they would have me use a key it appears they want a key appended to the end of the string and hashed. That way the server can appended the key it has along with the data passed to ensure its a valid accessing computer. Anyways... thanks all ^_^Edit2: As my comment below says, it was the term 'salting' I was oblivious to. Oh the joys of getting thrown into something new with no directions. <code> ",MD5 Hashing Given a Key in C#
C# HashTable Vs Dictionary - Can the Dictionary be as fast?," I am trying to figure out when and why to use a Dictionary or a HashTable.

Where as a HashTable will. As I understand it this leads to the HashTable being far faster for some situations.My question is really, what might those situations be?

Why is instantiating a collection of new generic objects in a generic method slow?," The code below is extremely slow for tables of any significant size. (100, 1000, etc...) The culprit is instantiating my objects with new T(). Note that this isn't my finalized code, I've just broken parts of it out in order to more easily profile. Instantiation and initialization will happen together once I refactor the code back into shape.Is there any way to speed this up? I'm probably forgetting something really simple, or maybe I'm boned. Hopefully, the former. edit for more info:The constructor of any given ModelType will look like this: The constructor of any given ModelTypeInfo will simply set some string and string[] values, and that class' only job is to provide the values set.edit for even more info:Since it seems to be a hot topic, here is what my method looks like for reals before breaking out object construction and initialization: <code>  public static IList<T> ToList<T>(this DataTable table) where T : Model, new(){ T[] entities = new T[table.Rows.Count]; // THIS LOOP IS VERY VERY SLOW for (int i = 0; i < table.Rows.Count; i++) entities[i] = new T(); // THIS LOOP IS FAST for (int i = 0; i < table.Rows.Count; i++) entities[i].Init(table, table.Rows[i]); return new List<T>(entities);} public ModelType(){ _modelInfo = new ModelTypeInfo();} public static IList<T> ToList<T>(this DataTable table, ModelInfo modelInfo) where T : Model, new(){ var tempRepository = new Repository<T>(modelInfo); var list = new List<T>(); foreach (DataRow row in table.Rows) list.Add(tempRepository.FromData(table, row)); return list;}",How can I speed up instantiating a large collection of objects?

I know that one obvious alternative is to declare two methods that would do the adding and removing, but I want to avoid that too.Does anybody knows if there is a nice solution this problem?

The code inside those calculation methods are identical except for the field that it does the calculation on.Is there a way that I can pass a property name as a parameter and just have one method that does all of the performing work instead of the 12 methods for each property?Also, I'm sure this can be accomplished via reflection, but I've seen in other code where lambdas are used in this same kind of fashion and was wondering if this is a candidate where this can be used.As requested, here is an example: My goal is to just make one method called GetTotalAmountByDate() and pass in a begin date, and end date and the name of the property (ReleasedFederalAmount or ReleasedLocalAmount, etc.) it needs to access.I hope this depicts accurately what I'm trying to accomplish. <code>  public class FinancialInfo{ public virtual DateTime AuditDate { get; set; } public virtual decimal ReleasedFederalAmount { get; set; } public virtual decimal ReleasedNonFederalAmount { get; set; } public virtual decimal ReleasedStateAmount { get; set; } public virtual decimal ReleasedLocalAmount { get; set; } public virtual decimal ReleasedPrivateAmount { get; set; } // more fields like this}public class FinancialLedger(){ public virtual DateTime? BeginDate { get; set; } public virtual DateTime? EndDate { get; set; } public virtual IList<FinancialInfo> Financials { get; set; } //not actual implementation, but you get the idea public decimal GetTotalReleasedFederalAmountByDate() { if (BeginDate == null && EndDate == null) return 0; decimal total = 0; foreach (var fi in Financials) { if (someCondition) if (someSubCondition) total += fi.ReleasedFederalAmount; else if (someOtherCondition) if (someOtherSubCondition) total += fi.ReleasedFederalAmount; else if (anotherCondigion) total += fi.ReleasedFederalAmount; } return total; } public decimal GetTotalReleasedNonFederalAmountByDate() { // same logic as above method, // but it accesses fi.ReleasedNonFederalAmount; } // More methods the same as the previous, just accessing different // members of FinancialInfo}",How can I pass a property of a class as a parameter of a method?

C#: Public Fields versus Automatic Properties," We're often told we should protect encapsulation by making getter and setter methods (properties in C#) for class fields, instead of exposing the fields to the outside world.But there are many times when a field is just there to hold a value and doesn't require any computation to get or set. For these we would all do this number: Well, I have a confession, I couldn't bear writing all that (really, it wasn't having to write it, it was having to look at it), so I went rogue and used public fields.Then along comes C# 3.0 and I see they added automatic properties: Which is tidier, and I'm thankful for it, but really, what's so different than just making a public field? <code>  public class Book{ private string _title; public string Title { get => _title; set => _title = value; }} public class Book{ public string Title { get; set; } } public class Book{ public string Title;}",Public Fields versus Automatic Properties

But I'm using a Socket with a NetworkStream.Point me in the correct direction if there's something blatently obvious that I'm missing, but if not, does this mean I am going to have to use some Data Binding on the DataAvailable property, and when it is set to true, to call my own 'home made' event/function?

Reducing memory usage of .NET applications," What are some tips to reduce the memory usage of .NET applications? Consider the following simple C# program.

Are there any tricks to make a C# process a bit leaner? I'm writing a program that's designed to run in the background most of the time. I'm already doing any user interface stuff in a separate Application Domain which means the user interface stuff can be safely unloaded, but taking up 10 MB when it's just sitting in the background seems excessive.P.S. As to why I would care --- (Power)users tend to worry about these things.

Programatically adding Images to RTF Document," I am trying to add a image to a RTF document which I am creating. I would prefer to not use 'copy/paste' methods (that involve pasting the image within a RichTextBox and then accessing the .RTF property) which purge the clipboard (as this will be a bother and confusion for my end users).The code I have so far returns the string that needs to be inserted into the RTF document to print the image.

However the problem is that this code does not work because as far as I can tell, the string str does not have the correct string conversion to work within the RTF.Edit: My problem was missing a space after the \hex in @""\hex "" and also not stripping out the ""-"" characters from the returned value of the BitConverter <code>  public string GetImage(string path, int width, int height){ MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream(); string newPath = Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, path); Image img = Image.FromFile(newPath); img.Save(stream, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png); byte [] bytes = stream.ToArray(); string str = BitConverter.ToString(bytes, 0).Replace(""-"", string.Empty); //string str = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes); string mpic = @""{\pict\pngblip\picw"" + img.Width.ToString() + @""\pich"" + img.Height.ToString() + @""\picwgoa"" + width.ToString() + @""\pichgoa"" + height.ToString() + @""\hex "" + str + ""}""; return mpic}",Programmatically adding Images to RTF Document

Making Methods All Static in Clas," I was told by my colleague based on one of my classes (it is an instance class) that if you have no fields in your class (backing fields), just make all methods static in the class or make the class a singleton so that you don't have to use the keyword new for calling methods in this BL class.I assume this is common and good practice? Basic OOP? I just want to see people's opinion on that.I think basically he's saying since there's no state, no need for the methods to be instance methods.I'm not sure about making it a singleton every time as an option in this case...is that some sort of pattern or good advice he's giving me?Here's the class I'm talking about (please do not repost any of this code in this thread, this is private): http://www.elbalazo.net/post/class.txt <code> ",Making Methods All Static in Class

The .Net equivalent of static libraries?," I'm building a tool in managed code (mostly C++/CLI) in two versions, a 'normal user' version and a 'pro' version. The fact that the core code is identical between the two versions has caused me a little trouble as I want to package the resulting tool as a single assembly (DLL) and I don't want to have to include the .cpp files for the common code in the projects of the two versions of the tools. I'd rather have a project for the common code and a project for each version of the tool and have each version of the tools project depend on the common code and link it in as desired.In unmanaged C++ I'd do this by placing the common code in a static library and linking both versions of the tool to it. I don't seem to be able to get this to work in C++/CLI. It seems that I'm forced to build the common code into a DLL assembly and that results in more DLL's than I'd like.So, in summary, I can't work out how to build the common code in one project and link it with each of the final product projects to produce two single DLL assemblies that both include the common code.I'm probably doing something wrong but I tried to work out how to do this using netmodules and whatever and I just couldn't get it to work. In the end the only way I got it working was to tell the linker to link the build products of the common code assembly rather than the results which works but is a bit of a hack IMHO.Anyway, does anyone have any suggestions for how I SHOULD be solving this problem?Edited: I guess I should have mentioned the fact that the assemblies generated are not 100% managed code, they contain a mix of managed and unmanaged code as is, probably, quite common with assemblies produced with C++/CLI... <code> ",The .NET equivalent of static libraries?

Why does C# 3 allow the implicit conversion of literal zero (0) to any Enum?," C#3 (Visual Studio 2008) introduced a breaking change to the language (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc713578.aspx, see change 12) that allows any literal zero to be implicitly converted to an Enum. This seems odd in many ways. Does anyone know why this is part of the spec? Why not a literal one? Or seven? Why is zero special? And it makes some very counterintuitive overload resolution choices. For instance. Very confusing, and an intentionally introduced breaking change to the language. Any ideas? <code>  function string F(object o) { return o.ToString(); }function string F(DbType t) { return t.ToString(); }int i = 0;F((long)0) == ""String"" // would have been ""0"" in VS 2005F(0) == ""String""F(i) == ""0""",Why does C# allow the implicit conversion of literal zero (0) to any Enum?

Faster way to find out if a user exists on a system? [Windows XP & C#]," I have an application that checks to see if a user exists (if not create it) every time it starts. This is done as follows: The problem is on the majority of the systems where it is deployed. This can take 6 - 10 seconds, which is too long ... I need to find a way to reduce this (as much as possible). Is there a better or faster way I can use to verify if a user exists on the system or not?I know there are other ways to solve this, like have the other applications sleep for 10 seconds, or have this tool send a message when it is ready, etc... But if I can greatly reduce the time it takes to find the user, it would make my life much easier. <code>  bool bUserExists = false;DirectoryEntry dirEntryLocalMachine = new DirectoryEntry(""WinNT://"" + Environment.MachineName + "",computer"");DirectoryEntries dirEntries = dirEntryLocalMachine.Children;foreach (DirectoryEntry dirEntryUser in dirEntries){ bUserExists = dirEntryUser.Name.Equals(""UserName"", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase); if (bUserExists) break;}",Faster way to find out if a user exists on a system?
Game Programming - Game architecture question," recently I have been trying my hand at coding a game in C#. I'm not using XNA for this, as I thought I would learn more if I coded the game from scratch (although I am using a multimedia engine).I'm trying to design a 2D RPG game - a bit ambitious I know, however I have a reasonably well understanding of at least the basic parts of the game (ie the 'boiler plate' code), and I've reached a part where I don't know where to go from here.In the 2D game, you progress through the game via walking around different 'areas'. Once you hit a 'portal tile', you are transported to the next area etc.I'm having trouble understanding how these area object should be set up. This was my first idea: Each area has a few different collection structures (for example, a visibility quadtree, a collision quadtree, an AI entity List etc). So if I were to add an enemy entity into the game, it would be put into the visibility quadtree, the collision quadtree (because you can collide with entities) and the AI entity list. When the area receives an update request, it tells each of these structures to update themselves, which in turn tell the entities to update themselves. All good, so far.My question is this: What if this enemy needs to communicate with other objects? For example, it might need to know whether the player was in a certain range of it. Or whether it had been hit by the player. Or where all the collidable objects are in the area (so it could pathfind).The first (and bad) solution to this problem would be simply to pass each entity a reference to each collection. But this obviously encourages tightly coupled objects, which is not good.The second solution I came up with was for each entity to be able to query the area, via message structures. So an enemy would be able to say ""Give me a list of each entity within X distance of my position"" and the area would return an answer. However, this would get increasingly difficult as I would have to code more and more possibilities into the area (""Give me a list of entities that are not within X distance of myself"", ""Give me a list of all entities with health lower than X"" etc).What I'm looking for is a time tested solution to this problem of inter object communication, and basically how to set up an area. I suppose it would need some kind of messaging system as well, although I'm not sure.Thanks for reading. <code> ",Game Programming - communication between game objects in 2d

"Auto-scrolling text box uses more memory than expected (C#, .NET v3.5)"," I have an application that logs messages to the screen using a TextBox. The update function uses some Win32 functions to ensure that the box automatically scrolls to the end unless the user is viewing another line. Here is the update function: Now the strange thing is that the text box consumes at least double the memory that I would expect it to. For example, when there are ~1MB of messages in the TextBox, the application can consume up to 6MB of memory (in addition to what it uses when the logToScreen is set to false). The increase is always at least double what I expect, and (as in my example) sometimes more.What is more strange is that using: Does not free the memory (in fact, it increases slightly).Any idea where the memory is going as I'm logging these messages? I don't believe it has anything to do with the Win32 calls, but I've included it to be thorough.EDIT:The first couple of responses I got were related to how to track a memory leak, so I thought I should share my methodology. I used a combination of WinDbg and perfmon to track the memory use over time (from a couple hours to days). The total number of bytes on all CLR heaps does not increase by more than I expect, but the total number of private bytes steadily increases as more messages are logged. This makes WinDbg less useful, as it's tools (sos) and commands (dumpheap, gcroot, etc.) are based on .NET's managed memory.This is likely why GC.Collect() can not help me, as it is only looking for free memory on the CLR heap.

resharper - question on exception warning," Consider this method (pardon the sad attempt at Chuck Norris humor :) ): In resharper, I get a warning on the ""throw e"" line saying ""Exception rethrow possibly intended"".

When to use memory-mapped files ?," I have an application that receives chunks of data over the network, and writes these to disk.Once all chunks have been received, they can be decoded/recombined into the single file they actually represent.I'm wondering if it's useful to use memory-mapped files or not - first for writing the single chunks to disk, second for the single file into which all of them are decoded.My own feeling is that it might be useful for the second case only, anyone got some ideas on this?Edit:It's a C# app, and I'm only planning an x64 version.(So running into the 'largest contigious free space' problem shouldn't be relevant) <code> ",When to use memory-mapped files?
Why this performance diference?

Anyone has a detailed explanation on why this HUGE diference ?EDIT: Running the test in Release mode, outside Visual studio i'm getting 35000-40000 iterations vs 400000000 iterations (always aprox)Note I'm running this with a crappy PIV 3.06Ghz <code>  for(long c = 0; c < 200000000; c++){ try { test = null; test.x = 1; } catch (Exception ex) { }} for(long c = 0; c < 1900; c++){ test = null; f (!(test == null)) { test.x = 1; }}",Why this performance difference?

C# Com Interop with Windows Media Player Visualisation," I am attempting to create a Windows Media Player (WMP) Visualization plugin in C#. I am quite new to exposing C# to COM and may have missed something basic. I have persisted with this for 3 days (about 20 hours) and not got past the single issue I will describe below.For those who don't know, WMP visualizations are the pretty images that show in media player while listening to music.In a nutshell: WMP will call certain methods on my C# COM interface, but not others.I have WMP 11 installedI downloaded the Latest Windows SDK which contains a C++ plugin wizard to compile a working visualization sample. This sample registers and works without issues in WMP.The dev kit contains a C++ header file named effects.h that contains 2 interfaces that must be implemented to get the plugin to work with WMP. It doesn't appear to much more complicated than that.Here they are As I mentioned, my COM knowledge my not be the best. This is what I did to port it to C#.I converted the interfaces to following The code for the class implementing the interfaces is as follows As you can see my code is pretty empty, nothing more than stubs really. My debugging is simple but does the job.Once this is compiled with a strong name it can be registered with:regasm assemblyname.dll /tlbthen dropped in the gac. Open regedit and add the the following info: Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\Objects\Effects New Key: WmpTestPlugin Under the new key add a new string value: Name: classid Value: {C476FF24-5E5C-419d-9110-05EC2EED8511}So we have built a plugin that conforms to the interfaces, registered it in the GAC and told media player it's there.If you open media player and right-click on the visualization space a menu will appear. In that menu will be our new plugin. When you move your mouse down to the new item WMP will call GetPresetCount on the plugin (this will log to the file). Then WMP is supposed to call GetPresetTitle but it NEVER does for me.If you open tools\options from the menu bar and select the Plugins tab you can select the new plugin. If you click Properties WMP will call GetCapabilities then DisplayPropertyPage and a message box from the plugin will appear. WMP then crashes. In the C++ version FinalConstruct() is called on a CComCoClass interface - I don't have this and don't know what it is. I think it may be lower level than I am using??I have tried many many things to get this to work including changing the method declarations. Please can someone look at it and help. I've looked all over the web for a solution and found nothing.Thanks for reading, Nanook <code>  MIDL_INTERFACE(""D3984C13-C3CB-48e2-8BE5-5168340B4F35"")IWMPEffects : public IUnknown{public: virtual /* [helpstring][local] */ HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE Render( /* [in] */ TimedLevel *pLevels, /* [in] */ HDC hdc, /* [in] */ RECT *prc) = 0;

I found an example for encoding AES in Android and encoding/decoding AES in C# but am not sure if these are compatible (C# requires an IV, nothing is specified for this in the Android example). Also, a recommendation on a good way of encoding the encrypted string for transmission over HTTP (Base64?) would be helpful. Thanks. <code> ",Encryption compatible between Android and C#
DDD - How to implement performant repositories for searching.," I have a question regarding DDD and the repository pattern. Say I have a Customer repository for the Customer aggregate root. The Get & Find methods return the fully populated aggregate, which includes objects like Address, etc. All good. But when the user is searching for a customer in the UI, I just require a 'summary' of the aggregate - just a flat object with summarised information. One way I could deal with this is to call the find method on the repository as normal, and then in the application layer, map each customer aggregate to a CustomerSearchResult / CustomerInfo DTO, and send them back to the client. But my problem with this is performance; each Customer aggregate may require multiple queries to populate all of the associations. So if my search criteria matched 50 customers, that's quite a hit on the DB for potentially retrieving data I'm not even going to need.The other issue is that I may wish to include summarised data about the customer that is outside of the Customer's aggregate root boundary, such as the date of the last order made for example. Order has it's own aggregate and therefore to get the customer's order information I would have to call the OrderRepository, also degrading performance.So now I think I'm left with two options:Add an additional Find method to the CustomerRepository which returns a list of these summary objects by doing one efficient query.Create a purpose built readonly CustomerInfoRepository, that just has the find method described in 1.But both of these feel like I'm going against the principles of DDD. My repositories inherit from a generic base: Repository where T : IAggregateRoot. These summary info object are not an aggregates, and are of a different type to T, so really #1 goes against the design. Perhaps for #2 I would create an abstract SearchRepository without the IAggregateRoot constraint?There are many similar scenarios in my domain. How would you implement this scenario? Thanks, DaveUpdateAfter reading Theo's answer, I think I will go with option #2 and create a specialised SearchRepository within my infrastructure geared towards these scenarios. The application layer (WCF services) can then call these repositories that just populate the summary DTOs directly rather than mapping domain entities to DTOs.**** Update 2 ****Although I asked this over a year ago I thought I'd just add that I've since discovered CQRS which is aimed at solving this exact problem.

Clever Uses of C# Iterators," C# 2 and VB.Net 8 introduced a new feature called iterators, which were designed to make it easier to return enumerables and enumerators.However, iterators are actually a limited form of coroutines, and can be used to do many useful things that have nothing to do with collections of objects.What non-standard uses of iterators have you seen in real code? <code> ",Clever Uses of .Net 2 Iterators
List<T>::AddRange implementation suboptimal," Profiling my C# application indicated that significant time is spent in List<T>.AddRange. Using Reflector to look at the code in this method indicated that it calls List<T>.InsertRange which is implemented as such: One can argue that the simplicity of the interface (only having one overload of InsertRange) justifies the performance overhead of runtime type cheching and casting.But what could be the reason behind the 3 lines I have indicated with (*) ?I think it could be rewritten to the faster alternative: Do you see any reason for not using this simpler and apparently faster alternative?Edit:Thanks for the answers. So consensus opinion is that this is a protective measure against the input collection implementing the CopyTo in a defective/malicious manner. To me it seems like a overkill to constantly pay the price of 1) runtime type checking 2) dynamic allocation of the temporary array 3) double the copy operation, when all this could have been saved by defining 2 or a few more overloads of InsertRange, one getting IEnumerable as now, the second getting a List<T>, third getting T[]. The later two could have been implemented to run around twice as fast as in the current case.Edit 2:I did implement a class FastList, identical to List, except that it also provides an overload of AddRange which takes a T[] argument. This overload does not need the dynamic type verification, and double-copying of elements. I did profile this FastList.AddRange against List.AddRange by adding 4-byte arrays 1000 times to a list which was initially emtpy. My implementation beats the speed of standard List.AddRange with a factor of 9 (nine!). List.AddRange takes about 5% of runtime in one of the important usage scenarios of our application, replacing List with a class providing a faster AddRange could improve application runtime by 4%. <code>  public void InsertRange(int index, IEnumerable<T> collection){ if (collection == null) { ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentNullException(ExceptionArgument.collection); } if (index > this._size) { ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentOutOfRangeException(ExceptionArgument.index, ExceptionResource.ArgumentOutOfRange_Index); } ICollection<T> is2 = collection as ICollection<T>; if (is2 != null) { int count = is2.Count; if (count > 0) { this.EnsureCapacity(this._size + count); if (index < this._size) { Array.Copy(this._items, index, this._items, index + count, this._size - index); } if (this == is2) { Array.Copy(this._items, 0, this._items, index, index); Array.Copy(this._items, (int) (index + count), this._items, (int) (index * 2), (int) (this._size - index)); } else { T[] array = new T[count]; // (*) is2.CopyTo(array, 0); // (*) array.CopyTo(this._items, index); // (*) } this._size += count; } } else { using (IEnumerator<T> enumerator = collection.GetEnumerator()) { while (enumerator.MoveNext()) { this.Insert(index++, enumerator.Current); } } } this._version++;}private T[] _items; is2.CopyTo(this._items, index);",List<T>.AddRange implementation suboptimal

What is a good code structure for api-independant vertex processing?," Currently working on a 3D media engine using C# and I have come across a little conundrum. I have my rending loop figured out, I got a great plug-in architecture and content management system and even a material pipeline all planned out. Then engine is planned to use DirectX and OpenGL (via 'renderer' plug-ins), along with both APIs' programmable pipe-line. Anyways, at the beginning of this week I started on working on the engines abstract layer for processing vertices (I have been dreading this for weeks now). And as some of you know, vertex handling between graphic APIs' is not at all related or the same. Well kinda related ;), but not the same. In OpenGL handling vertices is very straight-forward, you create the custom vertex structure, send it to the GPU and then let your shaders handle the rest. This is perfect for a flexible graphics pipe-line, OpenGL is not required to know what elements are contained with each vertex. DirectX on the other-hand requires us to create declarations for each vertex structure and then send them to the GPU.The issue is that I will not know what type of vertex structure is being passed and I would definitely like to avoid creating the abstraction layer that involves declaring each element of a vertex through enumerations and some abstract 'VertexDeclaration' class; this would cause some issues:1) Getting vertex elements will be a pain to say the least. I could use some 'VertexSemantic' and ask for the positions of vertex 'a - z', but when processing a lot of vertices for something like skeletal animation, it can have a lot of overhead.2) Not very user-friendly considering the engines' main focus is 'newbies'. I would like for users to be able to create custom vertices and mesh buffers, without having to declare a ton of objects, consuming valuable development time. 3) more? Now I could do something with attributes and then create declarations for vertex structures inside the DirectX renderer. For instance, go ahead and create some enums: Now I can create an attribute that users can apply to the 'fields' of each element in their vertex structure: An example of what a custom vertex structure could look like: This would be nice. In the DirectX plug-in (renderer) I could just create a utility class that can create the semantics for each structure type and then cache the data so the declarations don't have to be recreated for each vertex. I could even add a NONE enumeration value to ELementUsage so that custom values may be used for what ever means... but then again they would only work in OpenGL because DirectX requires you to mark each vertex... unless there is something I am missing.My question(s):Is there a better way to go about this (besides using the attirbutes)? Is there a way to avoid using VertexDeclarations in DirectX?Is there any thing you may not understand about 'my' question?EDIT:An issue with using attributes would be getting element data from each vertex. Say I wanted to get the positions of each vertex in a mesh buffer. Since I went with attributes, I can't just do 'vertex.Position', I would have to create a utility method that could extract a field reference from a vertex structure, like 'Utility.GetElement(vertex, ElementUsage.POSITION)' . This method would need to use reflection to first find the attribute, then return the reference to the field value. Setting the value would not even (i think) be possible?Another way would be to create an IElement interface and implement each element (Positon, Normal, etc). The interface could have Name property that I can return directly inside the inherited element structure, like the PositionElements' Name property would just return ""Positon"". Next I could hold the array of IElement indside a Vertex struct that contains methods like AddElement(IElement), GetElement(string name), GetElement(int index), Insert, Replace, etc. I would implement all elements known to DirectX so that the renderer plug-in could parse a vertex structure to create an array of vertex declarations. The issue with this is that I am not sure if an array '[]' can be used as vertex element data. Like, what other bytes does an array contain (if any) that would hinder me from passing the Vertex struct (contains the IElement array) directly to DirectX, then to the GPU?Implementing it this way would be absolutely perfect for what I need it for. Another question is could the inheriting types of IElement (the elements) be a class, or do element values have to be value-types? <code>  // for getting the format layout of the elementpublic enum ElementFormat{ Float, Float2, Float3, Byte, etc, etc}// for determining the 'usage' // (here is 'another' where DirectX limits vertex structures ><)public enum ElementUsage{ Position, Normal, Color, TextureCoord, etc, etc} public class VertexElementAttribute : Attribute { #region Properties /// <summary> /// Gets the total size (in bytes) of the element. /// </summary> public int Size { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Gets the number of values contained with-in the element. /// </summary> public int Count { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Gets the type semantic of the element. /// </summary> public ElementType Type { get; set; } /// <summary> /// Gets the usage semantic of the element. /// </summary> public ElementUsage Usage { get; set; } #endregion #region Init /// <summary> /// Creates a new vertex element attribute. /// </summary> /// <param name=""count"">The number of values contained within the element.</param> /// <param name=""size"">The total size (in bytes) of the element.</param> /// <param name=""type"">The type semantic of the element.</param> /// <param name=""usage"">The usage semantic of the element.</param> public VertexElementAttribute(int count, int size, ElementType type, ElementUsage usage) { Count = count; Size = size; Type = type; Usage = usage; } #endregion } public struct VertexPositionColor{ [VertexElement(3, sizeof(Vector3), ElementType.FLOAT3, ElementUsage.POSITION)] public Vector3 Xyz; [VertexElement(4, sizeof(Color), ElementType.FLOAT4, ElementUsage.COLOR)] public Color Rgba; ... etc}",What is a good code structure for api-independent vertex processing?

"Why does C# decimal.ToString(string) round away from zero, apparently inconsistent with the language spec?"," I see that, in C#, rounding a decimal, by default, uses MidpointRounding.ToEven. This is expected, and is what the C# spec dictates. However, given the following:A decimal dValA format string sFmt that, when passed in to dVal.ToString(sFmt), will result in a string containing a rounded version of dVal...it is apparent that decimal.ToString(string) returns a value rounded using MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero. This would appear to be a direct contradiction of the C# spec.My question is this: is there a good reason this is the case? Or is this just an inconsistency in the language?Below, for reference, I've included some code that writes to console an assortment of rounding operation results and decimal.ToString(string) operation results, each on every value in an array of decimal values. The actual outputs are embedded. After that, I've included a relevant paragraph from the C# Language Specification section on the decimal type.The example code: The paragraph from section 4.1.7 of the C# Language Specification (""The decimal type"") (get the full spec here (.doc)):The result of an operation on values of type decimal is that which would result from calculating an exact result (preserving scale, as defined for each operator) and then rounding to fit the representation. Results are rounded to the nearest representable value, and, when a result is equally close to two representable values, to the value that has an even number in the least significant digit position (this is known as bankers rounding). A zero result always has a sign of 0 and a scale of 0.It's easy to see that they may not have been considering ToString(string) in this paragraph, but I'm inclined to think it fits in this description. <code>  static void Main(string[] args){ decimal[] dArr = new decimal[] { 12.345m, 12.355m }; OutputBaseValues(dArr); // Base values: // d[0] = 12.345 // d[1] = 12.355 OutputRoundedValues(dArr); // Rounding with default MidpointRounding: // Math.Round(12.345, 2) => 12.34 // Math.Round(12.355, 2) => 12.36 // decimal.Round(12.345, 2) => 12.34 // decimal.Round(12.355, 2) => 12.36 OutputRoundedValues(dArr, MidpointRounding.ToEven); // Rounding with mr = MidpointRounding.ToEven: // Math.Round(12.345, 2, mr) => 12.34 // Math.Round(12.355, 2, mr) => 12.36 // decimal.Round(12.345, 2, mr) => 12.34 // decimal.Round(12.355, 2, mr) => 12.36 OutputRoundedValues(dArr, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero); // Rounding with mr = MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero: // Math.Round(12.345, 2, mr) => 12.35 // Math.Round(12.355, 2, mr) => 12.36 // decimal.Round(12.345, 2, mr) => 12.35 // decimal.Round(12.355, 2, mr) => 12.36 OutputToStringFormatted(dArr, ""N2""); // decimal.ToString(""N2""): // 12.345.ToString(""N2"") => 12.35 // 12.355.ToString(""N2"") => 12.36 OutputToStringFormatted(dArr, ""F2""); // decimal.ToString(""F2""): // 12.345.ToString(""F2"") => 12.35 // 12.355.ToString(""F2"") => 12.36 OutputToStringFormatted(dArr, ""###.##""); // decimal.ToString(""###.##""): // 12.345.ToString(""###.##"") => 12.35 // 12.355.ToString(""###.##"") => 12.36 Console.ReadKey();}private static void OutputBaseValues(decimal[] dArr){ Console.WriteLine(""Base values:""); for (int i = 0; i < dArr.Length; i++) Console.WriteLine(""d[{0}] = {1}"", i, dArr[i]); Console.WriteLine();}private static void OutputRoundedValues(decimal[] dArr){ Console.WriteLine(""Rounding with default MidpointRounding:""); foreach (decimal d in dArr) Console.WriteLine(""Math.Round({0}, 2) => {1}"", d, Math.Round(d, 2)); foreach (decimal d in dArr) Console.WriteLine(""decimal.Round({0}, 2) => {1}"", d, decimal.Round(d, 2)); Console.WriteLine();}private static void OutputRoundedValues(decimal[] dArr, MidpointRounding mr){ Console.WriteLine(""Rounding with mr = MidpointRounding.{0}:"", mr); foreach (decimal d in dArr) Console.WriteLine(""Math.Round({0}, 2, mr) => {1}"", d, Math.Round(d, 2, mr)); foreach (decimal d in dArr) Console.WriteLine(""decimal.Round({0}, 2, mr) => {1}"", d, decimal.Round(d, 2, mr)); Console.WriteLine();}private static void OutputToStringFormatted(decimal[] dArr, string format){ Console.WriteLine(""decimal.ToString(\""{0}\""):"", format); foreach (decimal d in dArr) Console.WriteLine(""{0}.ToString(\""{1}\"") => {2}"", d, format, d.ToString(format)); Console.WriteLine();}","Why does .NET decimal.ToString(string) round away from zero, apparently inconsistent with the language spec?"

Any considerations before jumping into SQLLite?," I have a WCF application that at present is using XML based file storage to store data that gets used to generate reports. Besides this processing decisions are made based on information stored in these XML files. I'm now hitting volumes of around 30 000 text files. This is incredibly taxing, and the application at times comes to a grinding halt. I've always wanted to swop out the XML DAL in favor of an RDBMS, but project managers simply won't allow it. But they would be willing to look at a serverless solution for example SQLLite. I am really tempted to just dive right in and start using it as a replacement DAL (Data Access Layer). I would need no more than around 20 tables in the whole solution, and I would expect to get no more than around 20 000 - 100 000 transactions a day, however this is extreme, the real volumes would be less than this in most cases. Update I am not expecting a great deal of simultaneous connections, when I say transactions, I essentially mean 1 or 2 clients that make calls and execute against the database in order. At times there might be a possibility of external clients making quick calls to the DB. But the bulk of DB connections will be done by my WCF service, which is a back end scheduled task, not serving 100's of people across an organization. Another good point is that I only need to retain data for 90 days, so the DB shouldn't grow too big. My main concerns are:How reliable is SQLLite? What if the DB File gets corrupted, will I loose all processing Data. How easy is the DB to back up? Will it handle my volumes? And lastly how well does the .net provider work (located here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlite-dotnet2/). If you have any experience with SQLLite, please post your experiences so I can make aan informed decision to switch or not. Thanks in advance... <code> ",Any considerations before jumping into SQLite?
AppDomain Unload killing Parent AppDomain...," I am having trouble figuring something out about my AppDomain.Unload(...) call. I have a detailed explanation with code from my earlier question. As it turns out, I was performing a couple of steps that apparently, I don't need to. However, I am fairly certain that when an AppDomain is created and then held in a collection: ...when you are done with it, you must unload it: then remove domain from the collection. When I unload the domain, however, the entire application is ending. If I remove the unload, all is well...and we are simply left with removing the domain from the collection. But I fear that my child AppDomain is not really unloaded. It may eventually get GC'd I guess, but that doesn't give me a warm fuzzy. The child AppDomain assembly (a Windows Form application) is started asynchronously via an interface (IModule) that is referenced in my adapter class which inherits MarshalByRefObject. I am wondering if this reference to IModule's Start() (which the plugin module assembly implements) is not marshaling properly (because of my implementation). So, when the Shutdown() method is called, the entire application dies. Should I make my IModule an abstract class instead so it should inherit MBR as well? Puzzled...After looking at my code: ...my fear is that since IModule is an interface, even though I am creating an instance in a child domain, the assembly is leaking into my main AppDomain. Therefore, when I attempt to unload the child domain, both domains are being unloaded. Would this be correct? And what would likely be the best solution to provide Start() & Stop() methods via the MBR (adapter) object? UPDATE: see my answer below for changes --Okay, there is no leaking -- everything inherits MBR:Host : MarshalByRefObject -- instances the ModuleAdapter in a new AppDomainModuleAdapter : MarshalByRefObject -- IModule interface, interface methods (Start,Stop)MyModulePlugin : MarshalByRefObject -- Application.Run(myForm)Am I doing something wrong still? I've tried several things and it just seems to be wrong or incomplete. When I tell the ModuleAdapter to shutdown, it calls AppDomain.Unload(AppDomain.CurrentDomain) and the Host domain stops as well. I am still getting some first chance exceptions on the application exit. But the form (myForm) has been told to .Close().So, I am still looking for the correct way of doing this... <code>  private static Dictionary<string , AppDomain> HostDomains;void StartNewDomain(string domainName){ AppDomain domain = AppDomain.CreateDomain(domainName); HostDomains[domainName] = domain;} if (HostDomains.ContainsKey(domainName)){ AppDomain.Unload(HostDomains[domainName]); HostDomains.Remove(domainName);} // instances the module for access to the module's Start() method IModule module = (IModule)domain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap( ModuleManager.Modules[modName].Name, ModuleManager.Modules[modName].EntryPoint.FullName);",AppDomain Unload killing Parent AppDomain

How does a .NET exe work?," What happens exactly when I launch a .NET exe? I know that C# is compiled to IL code and I think the generated exe file just a launcher that starts the runtime and passes the IL code to it. But how? And how complex process is it?IL code is embedded in the exe. I think it can be executed from the memory without writing it to the disk while ordinary exe's are not (ok, yes but it is very complicated).My final aim is extracting the IL code and write my own encrypted launcher to prevent scriptkiddies to open my code in Reflector and just steal all my classes easily. Well I can't prevent reverse engineering completely. If they are able to inspect the memory and catch the moment when I'm passing the pure IL to the runtime then it won't matter if it is a .net exe or not, is it? I know there are several obfuscator tools but I don't want to mess up the IL code itself.EDIT: so it seems it isn't worth trying what I wanted. They will crack it anyway... So I will look for an obfuscation tool. And yes my friends said too that it is enough to rename all symbols to a meaningless name. And reverse engineering won't be so easy after all. <code> ",How do i prevent my code from being stolen?

This is not Windows Server 2008 R2 and is the same in 64 or 32 bits.If I put a Debugger.Break before the DLL execution then I see the code get to the point of the break and then never come back into the DLL again. I do get some debug assertion warnings from within the function, again only in Windows Server 2008, but I'm not sure this is related.I created a console application that runs the C# DLL, which in turn loads the C++ DLL, and this works perfectly on Windows Server 2008 (although it does show the assertion errors, but I have suppressed these now).The assertion errors are not in my code but within ICtypes.c, and not something I can debug.If I put a breakpoint in the DLL it is never hit and the compiler says: If I try to debug into the DLL using Visual Studio.I have tried wrapping the code used to call the DLL in: But this also does not help.I have the source code for this DLL so that is not a problem.If I delete the DLL from the directory I get an error about a missing DLL.

"Using IoC and Dependency Injection, how do I wrap an existing implementation with a new layer of implementation without changing existing code so as not to violate the Open-Closed principle?"," I'm trying to figure out how this would be done in practice, so as not to violate the Open Closed principle.Say I have a class called HttpFileDownloader that has one function that takes a url and downloads a file returning the html as a string. This class implements an IFileDownloader interface which just has the one function. So all over my code I have references to the IFileDownloader interface and I have my IoC container returning an instance of HttpFileDownloader whenever an IFileDownloader is Resolved.Then after some use, it becomes clear that occasionally the server is too busy at the time and an exception is thrown. I decide that to get around this, I'm going to auto-retry 3 times if I get an exception, and wait 5 seconds in between each retry.So I create HttpFileDownloaderRetrier which has one function that uses HttpFileDownloader in a for loop with max 3 loops, and a 5 second wait between each loop. So that I can test the ""retry"" and ""wait"" abilities of the HttpFileDownloadRetrier I have the HttpFileDownloader dependency injected by having the HttpFileDownloaderRetrier constructor take an IFileDownloader.So now I want all Resolving of IFileDownloader to return the HttpFileDownloaderRetrier. But if I do that, then HttpFileDownloadRetrier's IFileDownloader dependency will get an instance of itself and not of HttpFileDownloader.So I can see that I could create a new interface for HttpFileDownloader called IFileDownloaderNoRetry, and change HttpFileDownloader to implement that. But that means I'm changing HttpFileDownloader, which violates Open Closed.Or I could implement a new interface for HttpFileDownloaderRetrier called IFileDownloaderRetrier, and then change all my other code to refer to that instead of IFileDownloader. But again, I'm now violating Open Closed in all my other code.So what am I missing here? How do I wrap an existing implementation (downloading) with a new layer of implementation (retrying and waiting) without changing existing code?Here's some code if it helps: <code>  public interface IFileDownloader{ string Download(string url);}public class HttpFileDownloader : IFileDownloader{ public string Download(string url) { //Cut for brevity - downloads file here returns as string return html; }}public class HttpFileDownloaderRetrier : IFileDownloader{ IFileDownloader fileDownloader; public HttpFileDownloaderRetrier(IFileDownloader fileDownloader) { this.fileDownloader = fileDownloader; } public string Download(string url) { Exception lastException = null; //try 3 shots of pulling a bad URL.

C# How do I split a string by strings and include the delimiters?," There are many similar questions, but apparently no perfect match, that's why I'm asking.I'd like to split a random string (e.g. 123xx456yy789) by a list of string delimiters (e.g. xx, yy) and include the delimiters in the result (here: 123, xx, 456, yy, 789).Good performance is a nice bonus. Regex should be avoided, if possible.Update: I did some performance checks and compared the results (too lazy to formally check them though). The tested solutions are (in random order):GabeGuffaMafuRegexOther solutions were not tested because either they were similar to another solution or they came in too late.This is the test code: As you can see, it was really just a quick and dirty test, but I ran the test multiple times and with different order and the result was always very consistent. The measured time frames are in the range of milliseconds up to seconds for the larger datasets. I ignored the values in the low-millisecond range in my following evaluation because they seemed negligible in practice. Here's the output on my box: I compared the results and this is what I found:All 4 functions are fast enough for common usage.The naive version (aka what I wrote initially) is the worst in terms of computation time.Regex is a bit slow on small datasets (probably due to initialization overhead).Regex does well on large data and hits a similar speed as the non-regex solutions.The performance-wise best seems to be Guffa's version overall, which is to be expected from the code.Gabe's version sometimes omits an item, but I did not investigate this (bug?).To conclude this topic, I suggest to use Regex, which is reasonably fast. If performance is critical, I'd prefer Guffa's implementation. <code>  class Program{ private static readonly List<Func<string, List<string>, List<string>>> Functions; private static readonly List<string> Sources; private static readonly List<List<string>> Delimiters; static Program () { Functions = new List<Func<string, List<string>, List<string>>> (); Functions.Add ((s, l) => s.SplitIncludeDelimiters_Gabe (l).ToList ()); Functions.Add ((s, l) => s.SplitIncludeDelimiters_Guffa (l).ToList ()); Functions.Add ((s, l) => s.SplitIncludeDelimiters_Naive (l).ToList ()); Functions.Add ((s, l) => s.SplitIncludeDelimiters_Regex (l).ToList ()); Sources = new List<string> (); Sources.Add (""""); Sources.Add (Guid.NewGuid ().ToString ()); string str = """"; for (int outer = 0; outer < 10; outer++) { for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { str += i + ""**"" + DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks; } str += ""-""; } Sources.Add (str); Delimiters = new List<List<string>> (); Delimiters.Add (new List<string> () { }); Delimiters.Add (new List<string> () { ""-"" }); Delimiters.Add (new List<string> () { ""**"" }); Delimiters.Add (new List<string> () { ""-"", ""**"" }); } private class Result { public readonly int FuncID; public readonly int SrcID; public readonly int DelimID; public readonly long Milliseconds; public readonly List<string> Output; public Result (int funcID, int srcID, int delimID, long milliseconds, List<string> output) { FuncID = funcID; SrcID = srcID; DelimID = delimID; Milliseconds = milliseconds; Output = output; } public void Print () { Console.WriteLine (""S "" + SrcID + ""\tD "" + DelimID + ""\tF "" + FuncID + ""\t"" + Milliseconds + ""ms""); Console.WriteLine (Output.Count + ""\t"" + string.Join ("" "", Output.Take (10).Select (x => x.Length < 15 ?

Are there alternatives to UltraWinGrid (for C#)?," I've been using the Infragistics UltraWinGrid for a while in a C# project, and while it's very spiffy, it is sometimes a bit heavy to run (and editing it in Visual Studio can be hazardous).I'm looking for a lighter alternative.

Namely, I'm looking for a beefed up DataGridView which:has data binding (duh!)has lock control over editingallows for sub-tables on opening a rowcan have multiple headers to group columns together (say header 1 is composed of ""Group A"" and ""Group B"", and header 2 has various columns under each group)has sorting by column (and can sort numbers properly, even if it does not have a stock method at first)has filtering by column (perhaps the most demanding spec) la UltraWinGrid/Excel (text field with a way to specify if the filter is equal, not equal, greater, lesser, starts with, ends with, etc).supports check box, text box or data bound list/combo box cellsallows cells to be merged (not the control cells of course!)can have events bound to each row (say double click) <code> ",Are there alternatives to UltraWinGrid?
WPF Getting Control null reference  during InitializeComponent," So my InitializeComponent method call in the Window's constructor is running through the XML and adding the controls and plugging them into their events. So when a property of one of the controls changes it calls the Method that subscribes to the event. The method references a control that has not yet been built. Why does this happen in this order here? It worked in WinForms because the events were not fired until later, after all the controls were created. Is there a way to force this in WPF?The other solutions I see are I need to subscribe to the events after initialization. I need to check for null whenever I deal with a control.  <code> ",WPF Getting Control null reference during InitializeComponent

How can I take the first 100 characters of html content ( without stripping the TAGS! )," There are lots of questions on how to strip html tags, but not many on functions/methods to close them.Here's the situation. I have a 500 character Message summary ( which includes html tags ), but I only want the first 100 characters. Problem is if I truncate the message, it could be in the middle of an html tag... which messes up stuff.Assuming the html is something like this: How would I take the first ~100 characters or so? ( Although, ideally that would be the first approximately 100 characters of ""CONTENT"" ( in between the html tags )I'm assuming the best way to do this would be a recursive algorithm that keeps track of the html tags and appends any tags that would be truncated, but that may not be the best approach.My first thoughts are using recursion to count nested tags, and when we reach 100 characters, look for the next ""<"" and then use recursion to write the closing html tags needed from there.The reason for doing this is to make a short summary of existing articles without requiring the user to go back and provide summaries for all the articles. I want to keep the html formatting, if possible.NOTE: Please ignore that the html isn't totally semantic. This is what I have to deal with from my WYSIWYG.EDIT:I added a potential solution ( that seems to work ) I figure others will run into this problem as well. I'm not sure it's the best... and it's probably not totally robust ( in fact, I know it isn't ), but I'd appreciate any feedback <code>  <div class=""bd"">""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. <br/> <br/>Some Dates: April 30 - May 2, 2010 <br/> <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. <em>Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit</em> in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

Is there any performance difference between Debug and Release?," I'm using MySql Connector .NET to load an account and transfer it to the client.This operation is rather intensive, considering the child elements of the account to load.In Debug mode, it takes, at most, 1 second to load the account.

The average would be 1500ms.Since there is no #if DEBUG directive or the like in my code, I'm wondering where the difference is coming from.Is there a project build option I could change?

Tracking Down a Stack Overflow in My Linq Query ," I've written the following LINQ query: The objective is to retrieve a list of the countries represented by the competitors found in the system. 'countries' is an array of ISOCountry objects explicitly created and returned as an IQueryable<ISOCountry> (ISOCountry is an object of just two strings, isoCountryCode and Name). Competitors is an IQueryable<Competitor> which is bound to a database table through LINQ to SQL though I created the objects from scratch and used the LINQ data mapping decorators.For some reason, this query causes a stack overflow when the system tries to execute it. I've no idea why, I've tried trimming the Distinct, returning an anonymous type of the two strings, using 'select c', but all result in the overflow. The e.CountryID value is populated from a dropdown that was in itself populated from the IQueryable<ISOCountry>, so I know the values are appropriate but even if not, I wouldn't expect a stack overflow.Why is the overflow is occurring or why might it be happening?As requested, code for ISOCountry: It's initialised from a static utility class thus: How I finally got it to work, see below... I am still curious as to what specifically is wrong with the original query, I'm sure I've done similar things before. <code>  IQueryable<ISOCountry> entries = (from e in competitorRepository.Competitors join c in countries on e.countryID equals c.isoCountryCode where !e.Deleted orderby c.isoCountryCode select new ISOCountry() { isoCountryCode = e.countryID, Name = c.Name } ).Distinct(); public class ISOCountry{ public string isoCountryCode { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; }} public static IQueryable<ISOCountry> GetCountryCodes() { // ISO 3166-1 country names and codes from http://opencountrycodes.appspot.com/javascript ISOCountry[] countries = new ISOCountry[] { new ISOCountry { isoCountryCode= ""AF"", Name= ""Afghanistan""}, new ISOCountry { isoCountryCode= ""AX"", Name= ""Aland Islands""}, new ISOCountry { isoCountryCode= ""AL"", Name= ""Albania""}, new ISOCountry { isoCountryCode= ""DZ"", Name= ""Algeria""}, new ISOCountry { isoCountryCode= ""AS"", Name= ""American Samoa""}, ... new ISOCountry { isoCountryCode= ""YE"", Name= ""Yemen""}, new ISOCountry { isoCountryCode= ""ZM"", Name= ""Zambia""}, new ISOCountry { isoCountryCode = ""ZW"", Name = ""Zimbabwe""} }; return countries.AsQueryable(); } IList<string> entries = competitorRepository.Competitors.Select(c=>c.CountryID).Distinct().ToList();IList<ISOCountry> countries = Address.GetCountryCodes().Where(a => entries.Contains(a.isoCountryCode)).ToList();",Tracking down a stack overflow error in my LINQ query

"Reference a GNU C DLL built in GCC against Cygwin, from C#/NET"," Here is what I want: I have a huge legacy C/C++ codebase written for POSIX, including some very POSIX specific stuff like pthreads. This can be compiled on Cygwin/GCC and run as an executable under Windows with the Cygwin DLL.What I would like to do is build the codebase itself into a Windows DLL that I can then reference from C# and write a wrapper around it to access some parts of it programatically. I have tried this approach with the very simple ""hello world"" example at http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/dll.html and it doesn't seem to work. I believe I should be able to reference a DLL built with the above code in C# using something like: But this approach doesn't seem to work. LoadLibrary returns null. It can find the DLL (helloworld.dll), it is just like it can't load it or find the exported function.I am sure that if I get this basic case working I can reference the rest of my codebase in this way. Any suggestions or pointers, or does anyone know if what I want is even possible? Thanks.Edit: Examined my DLL with Dependency Walker (great tool, thanks) and it seems to export the function correctly. Question: should I be referencing it as the function name Dependency Walker seems to find (_Z5hellov)? Edit2: Just to show you I have tried it, linking directly to the dll at relative or absolute path (i.e. not using LoadLibrary): This fails with: ""Unable to load DLL 'C:.....\helloworld.dll': Invalid access to memory location.

Oleg's answer gave me the information I needed to find out what I was doing wrong. There are 2 ways to do this. One is to build with the gcc -mno-cygwin compiler flag, which builds the dll without the cygwin dll, basically as if you had built it in MingW. Building it this way got my hello world example working! However, MingW doesn't have all the libraries that cygwin has in the installer, so if your POSIX code has dependencies on these libraries (mine had heaps) you can't do this way. And if your POSIX code didn't have those dependencies, why not just build for Win32 from the beginning. So that's not much help unless you want to spend time setting up MingW properly.The other option is to build with the Cygwin DLL. The Cygwin DLL needs an initialization function init() to be called before it can be used. This is why my code wasn't working before. The code below loads and runs my hello world example.

How to produce precisely-timed tone and silence in C#," I have a C# project that plays Morse code for RSS feeds. I write it using Managed DirectX, only to discover that Managed DirectX is old and deprecated. The task I have is to play pure sine wave bursts interspersed with silence periods (the code) which are precisely timed as to their duration. I need to be able to call a function which plays a pure tone for so many milliseconds, then Thread.Sleep() then play another, etc. At its fastest, the tones and spaces can be as short as 40ms.It's working quite well in Managed DirectX. To get the precisely timed tone I create 1 sec. of sine wave into a secondary buffer, then to play a tone of a certain duration I seek forward to within x milliseconds of the end of the buffer then play. I've tried System.Media.SoundPlayer. It's a loser [edit - see my answer below] because you have to Play(), Sleep(), then Stop() for arbitrary tone lengths. The result is a tone that is too long, variable by CPU load. It takes an indeterminate amount of time to actually stop the tone. I then embarked on a lengthy attempt to use NAudio 1.3. I ended up with a memory resident stream providing the tone data, and again seeking forward leaving the desired length of tone remaining in the stream, then playing. This worked OK on the DirectSoundOut class for a while (see below) but the WaveOut class quickly dies with an internal assert saying that buffers are still on the queue despite PlayerStopped = true. This is odd since I play to the end then put a wait of the same duration between the end of the tone and the start of the next. You'd think that 80ms after starting Play of a 40 ms tone that it wouldn't have buffers on the queue.DirectSoundOut works well for a while, but its problem is that for every tone burst Play() it spins off a separate thread. Eventually (5 min or so) it just stops working. You can see thread after thread after thread exiting in the Output window while running the project in VS2008 IDE. I don't create new objects during playing, I just Seek() the tone stream then call Play() over and over, so I don't think it's a problem with orphaned buffers/whatever piling up till it's choked.I'm out of patience on this one, so I'm asking in the hopes that someone here has faced a similar requirement and can steer me in a direction with a likely solution. <code> ",How to produce precisely-timed tone and silence?

Does new `dynamic' variable type in .NET 4.0 solve the single/multiple method dispatch issue in CLR?," The problem of single dispatch is mostly familiar to people engaged in coding with statically typed languages like Java and C#. The basic idea is:While the runtime polymorphism allows us to dispatch to the right method call according to the type (runtime type) of receiver, for example: The method call will be performed according to the runtime type of mything, namely Cat.This is the single dispatch capability (which is present in Java/C#).Now, if you need to dispatch not only on the runtime type of receiver, but on the types of (multiple) arguments either, you face a little problem: The second method never gets called, because in our 'consumer' code we just tend to treat different types of objects (visitors in my example) by their common supertype or interface.That's why I ask - because dynamic typing allows the multiple dispatch polymorphism and C# 4.0 has that dynamic keyword ;) <code>  IAnimal mything = new Cat();mything.chop(); public class MyAcceptor { public void accept (IVisitor vst) {...} public void accept (EnhancedConcreteVisitor vst) {...} }",Does new 'dynamic' variable type in .NET 4.0 solve the single/multiple method dispatch issue in CLR?

ConcurrentDictionary and updating values," I am trying to update entries in a ConcurrentDictionary something like this: Essentially I need to iterate over the dictionary and update a field on each Value. I understand from the documentation that I need to avoid using the Value property. Instead I think I need to use TryUpdate except that I dont want to replace my whole object. Instead, I want to update a field on the object.After reading this blog entry on the PFX team blog: Perhaps I need to use AddOrUpdate and simply do nothing in the add delegate.Does anyone have any insight as to how to do this?I have tens of thousands of objects in the dictionary which I need to update every thirty seconds or so. Creating new ones in order to update the property is probably not feasible. I would need to clone the existing object, update it and replace the one in the dictionary. Id also need to lock it for the duration of the clone/add cycle. Yuck.What Id like to do is iterate over the objects and update the Counter property directly if possible.My latest research has led me to to Parallel.ForEach which sounds great but it is not supposed to be used for actions that update state.I also saw mention of Interlocked.Increment which sounds great but I still need to figure out how to use it on each element in my dictionary in a thread safe way. <code>  class Class1{ public int Counter { get; set; }}class Test{ private ConcurrentDictionary<int, Class1> dict = new ConcurrentDictionary<int, Class1>(); public void TestIt() { foreach (var foo in dict) { foo.Value.Counter = foo.Value.Counter + 1; // Simplified example } }}",Updating fields of values in a ConcurrentDictionary

Why does C# allow abstract class with no abstract members?," The C# spec, section 10.1.1.1, states: An abstract class is permitted (but not required) to contain abstract members.This allows me to create classes like this: Or even better: This is really a concrete class; it's only abstract in so far as one can't instantiate it. For example, if I wanted to execute the logic in B.Main() I would have to first get an instance of B, which is impossible. If inheritors don't actually have to provide implementation, then why call it abstract?Put another way, why does C# allow an abstract class with only concrete members?

How to calculate actual months difference between two given dates in C#?," Example: given two dates below, finish is always greater than or equal to startstart = 2001 Jan 01finish = 2002 Mar 15So from 2001 Jan 01 to the end of 2002 Febmonths = 12 + 2 = 14For 2002 March15/30 = 0.5so grand total is 14.5 months difference.It's very easy to work out by hand but how do I code it elegantly? At the moment I have the combination of a lot of if else and while loops to achieve what I want but I believe there are simpler solutions out there.Update: the output needs to be precise (not approximation) for example:if start 2001 Jan 01 and finish 2001 Apr 16, the output should be 1 + 1 + 1= 3 (for Jan, Feb and Mar) and 16 / 31 = 0.516 month, so the total is 3.516.Another example would be if I start on 2001 Jul 5 and finish on 2002 Jul 10, the output should be 11 month up to the end of June 2002, and (31-5)/31 = 0.839 and 10/31 = 0.323 months, so the total is 11 + 0.839 + 0.323 = 12.162.I extended Josh Stodola's code and Hightechrider's code: <code>  public static decimal GetMonthsInRange(this IDateRange thisDateRange){ var start = thisDateRange.Start; var finish = thisDateRange.Finish; var monthsApart = Math.Abs(12*(start.Year - finish.Year) + start.Month - finish.Month) - 1; decimal daysInStartMonth = DateTime.DaysInMonth(start.Year, start.Month); decimal daysInFinishMonth = DateTime.DaysInMonth(finish.Year, finish.Month); var daysApartInStartMonth = (daysInStartMonth - start.Day + 1)/daysInStartMonth; var daysApartInFinishMonth = finish.Day/daysInFinishMonth; return monthsApart + daysApartInStartMonth + daysApartInFinishMonth;}",How to calculate actual months difference (calendar year not approximation) between two given dates in C#?
C# Arrow key events not arriving," Basically, I have a form with a custom control on it (and nothing else). The custom control is completely empty, and the form has KeyPreview set to true.With this setup, I am not receiving any KeyDown events for any arrow keys or Tab. Every other key that I have on my keyboard works. I have KeyDown event handlers hooked up to everything that has such events, so I'm sure I'm not missing anything.Also of note is that if I remove the (completely empty) custom control, I DO get the arrow key events.What on earth is going on here?EDIT:I added this to both the form and the control, but I'm STILL not getting arrow keys: I also checked with Spy++, and determined that the form itself is not getting any WM_KEYDOWN messages, they're all going to the control. However, that said, the control IS getting the arrow key WM_KEYDOWN messages. Sigh.Edit 2: I've also updated the ZIP file with this version. Please look at it, if you want to help...Edit 3:I've figured this out, sort of. The form is eating the arrow keys, probably in an attempt to maintain focus amongst its children. This is proven by the fact that I DO get the events if the form is empty.Anyway, if I add this code to the form, I start getting the events again: When I override this, the form doesn't get a chance to do its dirty work, and so I get my KeyDown events as I expect. I assume that a side effect of this is that I can no longer use my keyboard to navigate the form (not a big deal in this case, as it's a game, and the entire purpose of this exercise is to implement keyboard navigation!)The question still remains about how to disable this ""properly"", if there is a way... <code>  protected override void WndProc(ref Message m) { switch (m.Msg) { case 0x100: //WM_KEYDOWN //this is the control's version. In the form, it's this.Text ParentForm.Text = ((Keys)m.WParam).ToString(); break; } base.WndProc(ref m);} public override bool PreProcessMessage(ref Message msg) { switch (msg.Msg) { case 0x100: //WM_KEYDOWN return false; } return base.PreProcessMessage(ref msg);}",Arrow key events not arriving

Partly crashing application? How is this possible?," I have a program written in C#, running on a Windows CE device (on Compact Framework). It processes minimal user actions (button clicks), uses serial port and TCP/IP communication.The problem is sometimes the software shuts down on its own. In the background the application (or parts of the application) seems to be still running (at least in one documented case it was) because it uses the serial port, so restarting the application doesn't help. I can't reproduce the problem since it happens in most of the cases when there is no user interaction, no serial port communication and the network communication is all ""I am still alive"" messages, the software just crashes seemingly without reason. (I try to make it happen in debug mode to know at least where is the problem in the code if it is a software bug but I have had no luck so far.)Since I'm running out of ideas, the question is: what bug or exception or OS action or hardware malfunction can cause such a behaviour? The problem has been seen on different devices of the same type, so it shouldn't be a hardware error. (Or all my hardware has the same error.) Exceptions are handled, so it shouldn't be an exception. Unhandled exceptions are handled too, so it shouldn't be an unhandled exception either. (My guess is that it is caused by a StackoverflowException because I don't know any other exceptions that can't be caught, but there isn't recursion in the code, at least not willingly, so it shouldn't be a possibility either.) <code> ",Partly crashing application?

Which class has the responsability of drawing a Piece on a Board? The Piece or the Board?," So, I currently have a Board class that is composed of Pieces.

Visual Studio 2008 Locks Custom MSBuild Task Assemblies," I'm developing a custom MSBuild task that builds an ORM layer, and using it in a project. I'm being hampered by Visual Studio's behaviour of holding onto MSBuild task DLLs and not letting go. I'd like to organize my solution like this; However, when project (2) builds, it locks onto the assembly from project (1). So now I can't build project (1) again without closing the solution and re-opening it. Is there any way I can organize things so that the custom build task is not kept locked by Visual Studio? <code>  My Solution | +- (1) ORM Layer Custom Task Project | | | +- BuildOrmLayerTask.cs // here's my task | +- (2) Business Logic Project // and here's the project that uses it. | +- <UsingTask TaskName=""BuildOrmLayerTask"" AssemblyFile=""$(TaskAssembly)"" />",Visual Studio 2008 locks custom MSBuild Task assemblies

C# how to let Timer skip tick if the previous thread is still busy," I created a windows service, that is supposed to check a certain table in the db for new rows every 60 seconds. For every new row that was added, I need to do some heavy processing on the server that could sometimes take more than 60 seconds.I created a Timer object in my service, that ticks every 60 seconds and invokes the wanted method.Since I don't want this timer to tick while processing the new lines found, I wrapped the method in a lock { } block, so this won't be accessible by another thread.It looks something like this : Now, I'm wondering -If my timer ticks, and finds a lot of new rows on the db, and now the processing will take more than 60 seconds, the next tick won't do any processing till the previous one finished. This is the effect I want.But now, will the serviceTimer_Elapsed method go off immediatly once the first processing was finished, or will it wait for the timer to tick again.What I want to happen is - if the processing requires more than 60 seconds, than the timer will notice the thread is locked, and wait another 60 seconds to check again so I will never get stuck in a situation where there are a queue of threads waiting for the previous one to finish.How can i accomplish this result ?What is the best practice for doing this ?Thanks! <code>  Timer serviceTimer = new Timer();serviceTimer.Interval = 60;serviceTimer.Elapsed += new ElapsedEventHandler(serviceTimer_Elapsed);serviceTimer.Start();void serviceTimer_Elapsed(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e){ lock (this) { // do some heavy processing... }}",How to let Timer skip tick if the previous thread is still busy

c# still confused about covariance and contravariance & in/out," ok i read a bit on this topic on stackoverflow, watched this & this, but still a bit confused about co/contra-variance. from here Covariance allows a ""bigger"" (less specific) type to be substituted in an API where the original type is only used in an ""output"" position (e.g. as a return value). Contravariance allows a ""smaller"" (more specific) type to be substituted in an API where the original type is only used in an ""input"" position.i know it has to do with type safety. about the in/out thing. can i say i use in when i need to write to it, and out when its read only. and in means contra-variance, out co-variance. but from the explanation above... and here For example, a List<Banana> can't be treated as a List<Fruit> because list.Add(new Apple()) is valid for List but not for List<Banana>.so shouldn't it be, if i were to use in/ am going to write to the object, it must be bigger more generic. i know this question has been asked but still very confused.  <code> ",still confused about covariance and contravariance & in/out

Avoiding the C# compiler's desire to automatically explicitly implement an interface," I ran into a strange C# edge case and am looking for a good work-around.There is a class that I do not control that looks like this: I'd like to inherit from this class in a class I do control.

Instead, I see ""MyCompany.IInterfaceIDoControl.SomeMethod"" for the output implying an extra stack frame.The reason is that under the covers, the C# compiler is changing ""ClassIDoControl"" to look like this: Is there a way to avoid this compiler-generated extra layer of indirection with explicitly implemented interfaces? <code>  namespace OtherCompany{ public class ClassIDoNotControl { public void SomeMethod(string argument) { Console.WriteLine((new StackFrame(1).GetMethod().Name)); } }} interface IInterfaceIDoControl{ void SomeMethod(string argument);}class ClassIDoControl : OtherCompany.ClassIDoNotControl, IInterfaceIDoControl{} namespace MyCompany{ class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { IInterfaceIDoControl i = new ClassIDoControl(); i.SomeMethod(""Hello World!""); // Prints ""Main"" } } } class ClassIDoControl : OtherCompany.ClassIDoNotControl, IInterfaceIDoControl{ void IInterfaceIDoControl.SomeMethod(string argument) { base.SomeMethod(argument); }}",Why does the C# compiler insert an explicit interface implementation?

Is a C# struct ever boxed when used as the return value of a function?," A simple question, but I haven't found a definitive answer on Stack Overflow. Is a C# struct (value type) always copied to the stack when returned from a function, no matter how large it might be? The reason I'm unsure is that for some instruction sets other than MSIL (such as x86), a return value usually needs to fit into a processor register, and the stack is not directly involved.If so, is it the call site that pre-allocates space on the CLR stack for the (expected) value return type?[edit: summary of replies:] For the intent of the original question, the answer is no; the CLR will never (silently) box a struct just for the purpose of sending it as a return value. <code>  struct MyStruct { int x, y, z; } MyStruct GetMyStruct() => new MyStruct(); static void Main() { var x = GetMyStruct(); // can boxing/unboxing ever occur? }",Is a C# struct ever boxed when declared as the return value of a function?

My company recently approved project to be written in C#, so we have a lot of VB.Net programmers, however, we have some legacy app developers as well that are in VB6. We have a time frame to re-write those apps into .Net web apps. So no matter what they will have to learn new stuff.One of the developers today specifically asked ""why should we switch to C#?"" I responded that the community largely has decided that C# is the way to go with about 80% of the examples in C#. I am a VB.Net programmer and I am excited to finally cut my teeth on C#, however, being that I'm so new I'm not sure I can answer the ""why?"" question.

Can a class property be of anonymous type in C# 4.0?," As in: Note: The above doesn't compile nor work (the var cannot be used there), it's only to show my point.Update: Just to clarify the question, I had already tried using and this works, but it doesn't generate intellisense because of the dynamic typing. I am aware that anonymous typing is just a compiler trick, so I hoped I could use this trick to my advantage by declaring a structured field without having to declare a class beforehand (mainly because there's only going to be one instance of this particular kind of field). I can see now that it's not possible, but I'm not sure why that is. If the compiler is simply generating an implicit type for an anonymous object, it should be fairly simply to have the compiler generate this implicit type for a field. <code>  public class MyClass { private static var MyProp = new {item1 = ""a"", item2 = ""b""};} private static dynamic MyProp = new {item1 = ""a"", item2 = ""b""};",Can a class property/field be of anonymous type in C# 4.0?

Ternary operator VB vs C#: why resolves to integer and not integer?," I just shoot myself in the foot and would like to know whether there were actual reasons to make this situation possible.And anyway, this question can stay for the convenience of the future foot shooters.Suppose we have a nullable value in vb.net: We want to assign a value to it, basing on a condition, and using a ternary operator, because it's so neat and stuff: That is, if a condition is true, employ the nullability, otherwise the value.At which point the shooting occurs. For no apparent reason VB compiler decides that the common base type for Nothing and Integer is Integer, at which point it silently translates the statement to: Now, if you were to do this in C#: You would immediately get a compiler error saying that <null> doesn't mix well with int. Which is great, as my foot would have been healthier had I went the C# way this time. And for this to compile, you have to explicitly write: Now, you can do the same in VB and get the correct null-ness you would expect: But that requires having your foot shot in the first place. There's no compiler error and there's no warning. That's with Explicit On and Strict On.So my question is, why?Should I take this as a compiler bug?Or can someone explain why the compiler behaves this way? <code>  Dim i as Integer? i = If(condition(), Nothing, 42) i = If(condition(), 0, 42) i = (condition()) ? null : 42; i = (condition()) ? null : (int?)42; i = If(condition(), Nothing, CType(42, Integer?))",Ternary operator VB vs C#: why resolves Nothing to zero?

How to replace an Paragraph's text using OpenXMLSdk," I am parsing some Openxml word documents using the .Net OpenXml SDK 2.0.

So Regex.Match(currentParagraph.InnerText, currentString).Successreturns true and tells me that the current paragraph contains the text I want.As I said, InnerText itself is not settable, so I tried created a new paragraph using outerxml is given below. Even though I am not too concerned about the formatting at this level and it doesn't seem to have any, the outerXML seems to have extra elements that defeat the regex. ...""16"" /><w:lang w:val=""en-AU"" /></w:rPr><w:t>a</w:t></w:r><w:proofErr w:type=""gramEnd"" /> <w:r w:rsidRPr=""00C73B58""><w:rPr><w:sz w:val=""16"" /><w:szCs w:val=""16"" /><w:lang w:val=""en-AU"" /></w:rPr><w:t xml:space=""preserve""> contract exclusively for construction work that is not building work.</w:t></w:r></w:p>So in summary, how would I replace the text in a Paragraph of OpenXml with other text.

Error: Deleted row information cannot be accessed through the row.

In C# when is a value/object copied and when is its reference copied?," I keep getting the same issue over and over again where an object I want to reference is copied or where an object I want to copy is referenced. This happens when I use the = operator.For example, if I am sending the object to another form, ie: ...and then modify the object in the form, the original object does not get modified. It is as if the object was copied and not referenced. Yet, when I do this: ...and then modify anotherObject, myObject gets modified as well.The most aggravating case is when I try to Clone one of my defined objects: when I do this... ...obj1 is referenced and any modifications to obj2 changes obj1.System objects such as int, double, string, etc seem to always be copied, except for in the case of the clone method above.My question is, not taking into account the use of the ref keyword in functions, when does an object get copied and when does an object get referenced in every case of the matter (i.e. when passing to functions, when setting as other objects (like the first two above examples), when copying member variables like the third example, etc.)? <code>  SomeForm myForm = new SomeForm();SomeObject myObject = new SomeObject();myForm.formObject = myObject; SomeObject myObject = new SomeObject();SomeObject anotherObject = new SomeObject();anotherObject = myObject; public class SomeObject{ double value1, value2; //default constructor here public SomeObject(val1, val2) { value1 = val1; value2 = val2; } public void Clone(SomeObject thingToCopy) { this.value1 = thingToCopy.value1; this.value2 = thingToCopy.value2; }} SomeObject obj1 = new SomeObject(1, 2);SomeObject obj2 = new SomeObject();obj2.Clone(obj1);",When is a C# value/object copied and when is its reference copied?

What is the proper way to save combined (new+modified) detached entities in Entity Framework?," What is the proper and fast way to save combined new and modified detached POCO entities?I was thinking about these methods: When you are working in detached environment you have to know which entity was added and which is modified - it is your responsibility to keep this information and provide it to ObjectContext.Well i agree with this statement if you found yourself in situation when you need to use EF code like this in EF definitely something is wrong with you decision.

TypeForwardedToAttribute is a joke?," I came across to this attribute in this post and this one. It seems that it's very useful when we need to upgrade an old system. Then I create a test solution(with 3 projects in it) in order to use this attribute. Firstly there is a class library project named ""Animal"". Then I create a console application project, add ""Animal"" as a reference, and in the Main method I have: Now it prints ""old version"". Great! Now I begin to ""upgrade"" the existing project. I remove the class Dog in ""Animal"" add another class library project named ""AdvancedAnimal"" which contains: Add ""AdvancedAnimal"" as a reference in ""Animal"". Also AssemblyInfo.cs of ""Animal"" is modified by adding: From the usage of this attribute, from now on all Animal.Dog is forwarded to the Dog class in ""AdvancedAnimal""(actually there is no Dog class in Animal any more). I re-compile the whole solution and hope the console application prints ""new version"". But it gives me a compile error:The type name 'Dog' could not be found in the namespace 'Animal'. This type has been forwarded to assembly 'AdvancedAnimal, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' Consider adding a reference to that assembly.Oh, I'm told to add ""AdvancedAnimal"" as a reference to my console application! But if I do so, I don't need the attribute any more, because if I add ""AdvancedAnimal"" as a reference in the console application, of course Animal.Dog refers the one in ""AdvancedAnimal""! What I expect is that modifying ""Animal"", Adding ""AdvancedAnimal"", no necessary to change all other projects/class libraries because the assembly info already provides enough information. That is really convenient when upgrading a system. Otherwise, I have 20 projects referring to ""Animal"", I need to add ""AdvancedAnimal"" as a reference to all of them. And more important is, I can't find any usage of ""TypeForwardedToAttribute"" in this solution, removing it doesn't matter anything. Can you tell me what's wrong with my test/idea? <code>  namespace Animal{ public class Dog { public static string Name = ""old version""; }} Console.WriteLine(Animal.Dog.Name); namespace Animal{ public class Dog { public static string Name = ""new version""; }} [assembly: TypeForwardedTo(typeof(Animal.Dog))]",What is the correct way to use TypeForwardedToAttribute?
[C#][Windows Internals] Securely erasing a file using simple methods?," Possible Duplicate: C# - Deleting a file permanently Hello,I am using C# .NET Framework 2.0. I have a question relating to file shredding. My target operating systems are Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. Possibly Windows Server 2003 or 2008 but I'm guessing they should be the same as the first three.My goal is to securely erase a file. I don't believe using File.Delete is secure at all. I read somewhere that the operating system simply marks the raw hard-disk data for deletion when you delete a file - the data is not erased at all. That's why there exists so many working methods to recover supposedly ""deleted"" files. I also read, that's why it's much more useful to overwrite the file, because then the data on disk actually has to be changed. Is this true? Is this generally what's needed? If so, I believe I can simply write the file full of 1's and 0's a few times.

When the service is called and that method throws an unexpected exception, I like to catch that to write it to the log.Solution:Obviously it is like in a normal C# application:Just add a handler to the UnhandledException event like this inside the OnStart() of the Role.

As far as I can tell, I need to write commands in to get useful output, and Visual Studio is better. So I open it with Visual Studio. I can choose to ""Debug with Native Only"", but I get lots of things that mean something to clever people like you, and I am not clever! I get these two screens: So, my question:How do I show Visual Studio to my source code?Also, is there a way to get a smaller dump file? It seems ridiculously big, even after compressing.

[C#] Random Number Generation - Same Number returned," Possible Duplicates: c# - getting the same random number repeatedly Random number generator not working the way I had planned (C#) I have a method that builds a queue of ints: JE_Rand.rInt() is just a function that delegates to a function of the Random class: But when I call generateTrainingInts, the same number is enqueued each time.

C#.NET - How do I save files to hard disk in a separate thread?," I've a camera and I'm reading the images in real time into an array.I'm applying some algorithm to the image and displaying it. Then I get the next image and display it as well. So I'm streaming images from the camera to the display. However I also want to save images to hard disk once I've displayed them. I tried using the main thread but everything slowed down too much.I then tried using ThreadPool (see code below). This doesn't slow the display down but I've found the images aren't being saved properly. It looks like they are not in the expected order and after about 50 images have been saved the subsequent image data looks garbled. I'm guessing too many threads are being started.Is there a better way to do this? I think I only need one thread to save the images. Maybe some kind of queue that saves each image sequentially. Just as long as its done in the background and doesn't slow down the display. If someone could post a code snippet that would be fantastic. <code>  short[] image1 = new short[20000];while(streaming){ ReadImageFromCamera(ref image1) ImageData data; data.fileName = imageNumber; data.image = image1; ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(WriteImageToFile, data); // Send the writes to the queue}private void WriteImageToFile(object imageData) { try { ImageData data = (ImageData)imageData; System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter bf = new System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter(); string fName = myDirectory + @""/"" + Convert.ToString(data.fileName) + @"".spe""; using (Stream myStream = new FileStream(fName, FileMode.Create)) { bf.Serialize(myStream, data.image); } } catch (Exception) { }}",How do I save files to hard disk in a separate thread?

CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x3b2d70 to COM context ," While debugging an application i am getting the following error. The CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x3b2d70 to COM context 0x3b2ee0 for 60 seconds. The thread that owns the destination context/apartment is most likely either doing a non pumping wait or processing a very long running operation without pumping Windows messages. This situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead to the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over time. To avoid this problem, all single threaded apartment (STA) threads should use pumping wait primitives (such as CoWaitForMultipleHandles) and routinely pump messages during long running operations.Why system throws this error. <code> ",CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x3b2d70 to COM context
C# Visual Studio 2010 suddenly can't see namespace?," My C# WinForms solution has two projects.A DLL which is the main project I'm working on, and an executable WinForms I call ""Sandbox"" so that I can compile/run/debug the DLL easily in one go.I'm working in .Net 4.0 for both projects.Everything was working fine until I added some seemingly innocent code, and a reference to System.Web in the DLL.Now my Sandbox project can't see the namespace of the DLL project. I didn't change anything which I believe should have affected this.If I delete the project reference to the DLL from the Sandbox references and re-add it, then the red underlines all disappear and the colour coding comes back for all my classes etc; but as as soon as I try to build the solution, the whole thing falls apart again.When I right-click the DLL project in the Sandbox's references and view in object browser, I can see the namespace and all the stuff in there.I have a feeling this might be some sort of bug?Is this some sort of VS2010 bug?

why is C# 4 optional parameters defined on interface not enforced on implementing class?," I noticed that with the optional parameters in C# 4 if you specify an optional parameter on an interface you don,t have to make that parameter optional on any implementing class: and therefore: Does anyone know why optional parameters are designed to work this way?On one hand I suppose the ability to override any default values specified on the interfaces is useful though to be honest I'm not sure if you should even be able to specify default values on the interface as that should be an implementation decision.On the other hand, this disconnect means you can't always use the concrete class and the interface interchangeably. This of course, wouldn't be a problem if the default value is specified on the implementation, but then if you're exposing your concrete class as the interface (using some IOC framework to inject the concrete class for instance) then really there's no point having the default value as the caller will have to always provide it anyway. <code>  public interface MyInterface{ void TestMethod(bool flag = false);}public class MyClass : MyInterface{ public void TestMethod(bool flag) { Console.WriteLine(flag); }} var obj = new MyClass(); obj.TestMethod(); // compiler errorvar obj2 = new MyClass() as MyInterface;obj2.TestMethod(); // prints false",Why are C# 4 optional parameters defined on interface not enforced on implementing class?

Authentication to FreshBooks oauth from C# ASP.NET MVC," I'm trying to use OAuth for authentication for the FreshBooks API from my ASP.NET MVC C# app. Here is what I have so far:I'm using DotNetOpenAuth here is the code I have in my controller action The TokenManager is the same class that is provided with the DotNetOpenAuth sample, I've set my consumer secret that FreshBooks gave me.On the consumer.Channel.Send(consumer.PrepareRequestUserAuthorization(...))

Safe (in the C# sense) way to solve problem easily solved by pointers," This is the obvious, easiest way to solve this problem. However, I'd prefer not to use an unsafe method if I can avoid it.

C# converting image to black and white," Before someone flames me for not checking the other posts, I have done that already. I have a specific question about one of the techniques that exist to convert an image to grayscale.I have read through the other posts on SO and basically copied technique 3 (ColorMatrix) from the tutorial at this site. It works very, very, quickly. The problem I'm having is that what I need is a pure BW image. (i.e.: if average(R,B,G) > 200 => white else black). I have implemented it the straightforward way, and it actually takes nearly 10x as long as the grayscale algorithm from the tutorial.I am no expert with image processing, and was wondering if there is any way to modify the snippet from the tutorial to convert images to pure black and white. If not, any efficient way would do.EDIT:Here's the code I'm using for the black and white (no brain approach): <code>  public Bitmap make_bw(Bitmap original) { Bitmap output = new Bitmap(original.Width, original.Height); for (int i = 0; i < original.Width; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < original.Height; j++) { Color c = original.GetPixel(i, j); int average = ((c.R + c.B + c.G) / 3); if (average < 200) output.SetPixel(i, j, Color.Black); else output.SetPixel(i, j, Color.White); } } return output; }",What is the fastest way to convert an image to pure black and white in C#?

c#: Ways to make use of 'using' directives less tedious.," Good programming practice these days tends to mean splitting your stuff up into lots of assemblies and namespaces (for example, see S#arp Architecture, MVC, etc.). However a side-effect of that is that you have to stick a whole bunch of 'using ' directives into every class file. You know the sort of thing: Every controller class needs to 'use' the models and viewmodels namespaces, etc., etc.Are there any techniques for making this easier? For example, is it possible to declare using directives at the namespace level instead of the file level - so that every class in a namespace 'foo' automatically is using namespace 'bar'? Or are there smart ways of setting the default 'usings' that Visual Studio adds, based on the folder you are in? Or other ways of making the adding of 'usings' less tedious? <code> ",Ways to make use of 'using' directives in C# less tedious

Is parsing null in to a method acceptable," Null is an odd data type for me, it seems as though it is wrong to ever use, maybe its the null pointer errors i got so often as a beginner that now have me associating any instance of null to some kind of evil!Anyway my question is in some cases is it ok to use null as a parameter? for example, a method may need a and b to do a task, but in some cases it may only need a. Is parsing in null ok for b in those odd instances and checking if(b==null) then we know what called it?Or am i way of the mark here? i must admit, what got me wondering whether this was acceptable was, the method in question could be overlaoded, but it would have a difference of possibly 5 or 6 lines out of the whole method. This made me worried about code duplication. <code> ",Is passing null in to a method acceptable

C# Is it slower to reference an array variable?," I've got an array of integers, and I'm looping through them: If I do: Is there any performance gain/loss?From my understanding, C/C++ array elements are accessed directly, i.e. an n-element array of integers has a contiguous memory block of length n * sizeof(int), and the program access element i by doing something like *data[i] = *data[0] + (i * sizeof(int)). (Please excuse my abuse of notation, but you get what I mean.)So this means C/C++ should have no performance gain/loss for referencing array variables.What about C#?C# has a bunch of extra overhead like data.Length, data.IsSynchronized, data.GetLowerBound(), data.GetEnumerator().Clearly, a C# array is not the same as a C/C++ array.So what's the verdict? Should I store int value = data[i] and work with value, or is there no performance impact? <code>  for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; i++){ // do a lot of stuff here using data[i]} for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; i++){ int value = data[i]; // do a lot of stuff with value instead of data[i]}","In C#, Is it slower to reference an array variable?"

What does the .NET/CLR C# String.Length property return?

The length of a string represents the number of characters regardless of whether the characters are formed from Unicode surrogate pairs or not. To access the individual Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object. - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228362%28v=vs.90%29.aspxVS 2010 Documentation Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. ...

To access the individual Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object. - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228362%28v=VS.100%29.aspxThe language used in both cases doesn't clearly differentiate between ""character"", ""Unicode character"", ""Char class"", ""Unicode surrogate pair"", and ""Unicode code point"".The language in the VS2008 documentation stating that a ""string represents the number of characters regardless of whether the characters are formed from Unicode surrogate pairs or not"" seems to be defining ""character"" as as object that may be the result of a Unicode surrogate pair, which suggests that it may represent a 4-byte sequence rather than a 2-byte sequence. It also specifically states at the beginning that a ""char"" object is encoded in UTF-16, which suggests that it could represent a surrogate pair (being 4 bytes instead of 2). I'm fairly certain that is wrong though.The VS2010 documentation is a little more precise. It draws a distinction between ""char"" and ""Unicode character"", but not between ""Unicode character"" and ""Unicode code point"". If a code point refers to half a surrogate pair, and a ""Unicode character"" represents a full pair, then the ""Char"" class is named incorrectly, and does not refer to a ""Unicode character"" at all (which they state it does not), and it's really a Unicode code point.So are both of the following statements true? (Yes, I think.)String.Length represents the Unicode code-point length, andString.Length represents neither the Unicode character length nor what we would consider to be a true character length (number of characters that would be displayed), but rather the number of ""Char"" objects, which each represent a Unicode code point (not a Unicode character). <code> ",What does the .NET String.Length property return?

.NET: Faster way to communicate using TcpClient?," I'm writing a client/server application in C#, and it's going great. For now, everything works and it's all pretty robust. My problem is that I run into some delays when sending packets across the connection.On the client side I'm doing this: (Left out some exception catching etc.) The server does the opposite, i.e. it blocks on NetworkStream.Read() until it has a whole request, then processes it and sends a response using Write().The raw speed of Write()/Read() isn't a problem (i.e. sending large packets is fast), but sending several small packets, one after another, without closing the connection, can be terribly slow (delays of 50-100 ms). What's strange is that these delays show up on LAN connections with typical ping times <1 ms, but they do not occur if the server is running on localhost, even though the ping time would effectively be the same (at least the difference should not be on the order of 100 ms). That would make sense to me if I were reopening the connection on every packet, causing lots of handshaking, but I'm not. It's just as if the server going into a wait state throws it out of sync with the client, and then it stumbles a bit as it reestablishes what is essentially a lost connection.So, am I doing it wrong? Is there a way to keep the connection between TcpServer and TcpClient synchronised so the server is always ready to receive data? (And vice versa: sometimes processing the request from the client takes a few ms, and then the client doesn't seem to be ready to receive the response from the server until it's had a few moments to wake up after blocking on Read().) <code>  NetworkStream ns = tcpClient.GetStream();// Send packetbyte[] sizePacket = BitConverter.GetBytes(request.Length);byte[] requestWithHeader = new byte[sizePacket.Length + request.Length];sizePacket.CopyTo(requestWithHeader, 0);request.CopyTo(requestWithHeader, sizePacket.Length);ns.Write(requestWithHeader, 0, requestWithHeader.Length);// Receive responsens.Read(sizePacket, 0, sizePacket.Length);int responseLength = BitConverter.ToInt32(sizePacket, 0);byte[] response = new byte[responseLength];int bytesReceived = 0;while (bytesReceived < responseLength){ int bytesRead = ns.Read(response, bytesReceived, responseLength - bytesReceived); bytesReceived += bytesRead;}",Faster way to communicate using TcpClient?
Which WCF exceptions should I retry and how would I approach it within this Using Statement," I'm attempting to extend this answer on SO to make a WCF client retry on transient network failures and handle other situations that require a retry such as authentication expiration.Question:What are the WCF exceptions that need to be handled, and what is the correct way to handle them?

Problems serializing types for a .NET WCF Service: Service Wsdl defines empty types in XSD.," I am writing a web service using WCF.I created data contracts.I created my service contract (interface). I defined methods (whose parameters are typed as for the data contracts).I implemented the service contract creating a service class.I hosted my service using a svc file and IIS.I tried my service, looked for http://localhost/myvirtdiriis/myservice.svc --> The service was loaded, and a nice web page describing the presence of my service showed.I wanted to look at the WSDL. Using the provided link I can see that types are only defined, I can see just the types definition (like <complexType>), but nothing inside (types are empty).I coded a simple client, a call to an operation went good, but when returning the type it is empty (internal fields have the construction values, while my service place some values there), for example, a call to an operation returning a type having three strings set by the operation contract method to ""Hello"", ""Hello2"" and ""Hello3"", returns the type having these strings set to """" (construction values, as if no changes happened).What happened?It seems that serialization fails.I am providing some:A1) A part of the service contract: A2) The service implementation: B) Types: C) WSDL (a part, the one concerning type definitions) The piece above is included here: NOTE:If I remove the MessageContract attribute from BrowseResponse and BrowseRequest (both removed otherwose the runtime gets crazy), the problem persists....Is it really an issue concerning messagecontracts???MAYBE THE SOLUTIONOK everybody, maybe I can see the light...If I remove all DataContract(s) and ServiceContract(s) attributes namespace and names (always without MessageContract(s)), everything works.

Compiler Version vs. NET Framework Version," Scenario:I have VS 2010 (C# 4 compiler) targeting 3.5 on my client machine.I am developing ASP.NET applications.

Later on an issue that is discovered at Runtime where an old (classic I believe) ASPX is using the function. No function accepts only x arguments where x is one less than the optional parameter is the runtime error.Does this mean normal classes and such use the C# compiler of the client, while the views (aspx) and such use the compiler on the server - thus causing issues if C# 4 is used in view/form files? <code> ",Compiler Version vs. NET Framework Version - Scenario with ASP.NET applications

Using an Icollection as a datasource for datagridview.," I've extracted the setting names and their respective values out of a configuration file into an ordered dictionary. The dictionary contains keys and values which are of the ICollection class. I want to bind that data and display it in a DataGridView. I've tried copying the strings to arrays and displaying those arrays, but when I ran the program the columns were blank and it did not seem to be binded at all.I've also attempted to set the DataGridView source directly to one the ordered dictionary collections (keys or values), but that also did not result in anything I wanted; the columns were still blank. However, a third column is made with the column name as ""length"" and displays the lengths of the entries in the ICollection. But needless to say I do not want the lengths, I want the entries themselves.Here is the code that I am using for this question: Upon the loading of the form, I load the configuration file and a private member called m_Settings has all the key-value pairs. Then I create a list and add the keys and the values separately. After setting the binding source to 'data', I run the program and both columns I added are both blank. Any ideas as to how I could get the ordered dictionary and display the entries in two columns labelled ""Settings"" and ""Values""? I believe that lists were compatible DataSources for DataGridViews, but now I'm starting to second-guess myself.Any help or direction is greatly appreciated!

C# generics: How to compare values of generic types?," How do I compare values of generic types?I have reduced it to a minimal sample: The error is: Operator '>=' cannot be applied to operands of type 'T' and 'T'.What on earth!? T is already constrained to IComparable, and even when constraining it to value types (where T: struct), we still can't apply any of the operators <, >, <=, >=, == or !=. (I know that workarounds involving Equals() exist for == and !=, but it doesn't help for the relational operators).So, two questions:Why do we observe this weird behaviour? What keeps us from comparing the values of generic types which are known to be IComparable? Doesn't it somehow defeat the entire purpose of generic constraints?How do I resolve this, or at least work around it?(I realize there are already a handful of questions related to this seemingly simple problem - but none of the threads gives an exhaustive or workable answer, so here.) <code>  public class Foo<T> where T : IComparable{ private T _minimumValue = default(T); public bool IsInRange(T value) { return (value >= _minimumValue); // <-- Error here }}",How to compare values of generic types?

Should I set my object properties default values to null or use the CLR default values for each type?," I have been trying to figure out the best way to handle default values. Setting a ID value to 0 makes sense, but if it is a money value or other that is not initially set, when you encounter it later in your code, it is impossible to tell if it has been set or was set to 0. If a money value is set to null, then you know it has not been set. Additionally, when dealing with the database, it is simple to know if you need to write a null value to a field vs trying to figure out if it is supposed to be null or not. What is the accepted way to handle this? vs <code>  Class MyModel{ public int Id {get;set;} public string Title {get;set;} public DateTime CreatedDate {get;set;} public bool IsActive {get;set;} //CLR will automatically set these values Public MyModel() { Id = 0; Title = String.Empty; CreatedDate = ""1/1/0001""; IsActive = false; }} Class MyModel{ public int?

How can I write methods to work with multiple number types?," I'm trying to write classes which handle different number types. I know that C# (and .Net in general, I believe) has no INumber interface, so I cannot use something like the following: That's okay, though, because I'd like to avoid the boxing/unboxing of every one of my numbers. I could, however, use conditional compilation for each type I want to support: This means I'll need to compile a different Library.dll and LibraryF.dll, however. Is there any more elegant solution to this?Obviously, in my example, I can simply write the code twice. I would like to use this process, however, to create large complicated data structures with an integer version and floating-point version, so do not want the possibility of copy-paste errors when updating my structure. Nor do I want the speed loss from wrapping the floating-point structure in an integral-wrapper, and unnecessarily converting all inputs to the more lenient data type. <code>  public class Adder<T> where T:INumber { public T Add(T a, T b) { return a + b; } } #if FLOAT public class AdderF { public float Add(float a, float b)#else public class Adder { public int Add(int a, int b)#endif { return a + b; } }",How can I write a single class to compile multiple times with different number types?
How to find the source of a request," I have a Web solution which contains two projects (A and B) with B referencing A.In A I have an Html extension method that obviously can be called from either A or B.My question is once the method is called (usually from a partial view) is there a way inside the method to figure out whether the call came from Assembly A or Assembly B without passing anything to it?I tried to see if I can do anything with HttpContext.Current.Request but could not find anything useful. I can get the URI but that still does not tell me which assembly the file that originated the Request is in.Thanks for your answers - the method returns a string and the string is from a string.resx file which I have one for each assembly. That is why I need to know which file to access to return the string. Since each assembly ""registers"" itself on start up if I add a new assembly my method will not change, since it will just look up the assembly.In fact my whole project will not change. The reason why I am not introducing another parameter at this time is b/c it will mean a HUGE amount of changes and I honestly don't see the benefit. While I see your point and I generally agree with it I think in my case it's not that the method returns different things , it's just grabbing the correct resource file based on the assembly. <code> ",How to find out which assembly handled the request

C#.NET Service to Linux Daemon," I am writing a portable service/daemon using .NET 3.5, my windows service is running, but I was wondering about the mono port...Mono-service is what I am looking for if I understand correctly. How exactly does this work though? I assume I need mono compatible code throughout my service, right? For example, I am using SQLite. Is it correct that in order to use this with mono I should refactor my code to use mono namespaces etc, such as Mono.Data.SQLite? May I still use Settings.settings?Also, I've read that daemons don't implement onStart/Stop methods, so do I need to change my code to run under mono/linux? i.e. is it ok to have these methods in my code, and ok to run ServiceBase.Run()? Does Mono-service accommodate these? <code> ",.NET Service to Linux Daemon

How to send continous keypress to a program?," I have been using SendKeys.Send() & SendKeys.SendWait() to send keys to the foreground program (a program different from the application written).I tried sending a continuous key-press by sending repeatedly the same key with a certain delay between them but the effect was not the same as a continuous keypress in that application.My question is: How can I send a continuous key-press to a program? The effect of that keypress must be the same as pressing myself that key continuously in the application.SOLUTION EDITThe solution was to call the method: with the parameters obtained from:public System.Diagnostics.Process[] p = System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessesByName(""process"");p[0].MainWindowHandle is hWndand using Spy on the window:right clicking on a message line in Spy shows the wMsg, wParam and lParam (all 3 in hexadecimal)SendMessage(p[0].MainWindowHandle, (uint)0x0100, (UIntPtr)0x00000041, (IntPtr)(0x001E0001));By sending only one WM_KEYDOWN message the effect is as the key is pressed continuously. To stop the program acting as the key is continuously pressed i have to press that key on the keyboard and release it, so that WM_KEYUP is generated.

easiest way to add code to all methods and properties that don't have a custom attribute," There are a a lot of questions and answers around AOP in .NET here on Stack Overflow, often mentioning PostSharp and other third-party products.

I haven't investigated the accuracy of this statement any further, but it's categoricality made me return back to Stack Overflow.So I'd like to get an answer to this very specific question:I want to inject simple ""if (some-condition) Console.WriteLine"" style code to every method and property (static, sealed, internal, virtual, non-virtual, doesn't matter) in my project that does not have a custom annotation, in order to dynamically test my software at run-time. This injected code should not remain in the release build, it is just meant for dynamic testing (thread-related) during development.What's the easiest way to do this? I stumbled upon Mono.Cecil, which looks ideal, except that you seem to have to write the code that you want to inject in IL. This isn't a huge problem, it's easy to use Mono.Cecil to get an IL version of code written in C#. But nevertheless, if there was something simpler, ideally even built into .NET (I'm still on .NET 3.5), I'd like to know.

CQRS and primary key," For my project, which is a potentially big web site, I have chosen to separate the command interface from the query interface. As a result, submitting commands are one-way operations that don't return a result. This means that the client has to provide the key, for example: Obviously I can't use an int for the primary key, so a Guid is a logical choice - except that I read everywhere about the performance impact it has, which scares me :)But then I also read about COMB Guids, and how they provide the advantages of Guid's while still having a good performance. I also found an implementation here: Sequential GUID in Linq-to-Sql?.So before I take this important decision: does someone have experience with this matter, of advice?Thanks a lot!Lud <code>  service.SubmitCommand(new AddUserCommand() { UserId = key, ... });",CQRS and primary key: guid or not?

C# - does passing Reference Types using ref save memory?," In C#, the parameters to a method can be either reference types or value types. When passing reference types, a copy of the reference is passed. This way, if inside a method we try to reassign the passed reference to another object instance, outside of the method the reassignment is not visible.To make this working, C# has the ref modifier. Passing a reference type with ref actually uses the original reference instead of a copy. (Correct me if I'm wrong).In this case, since we are not creating a copy of the reference, are we saving any memory? If a method is extensively called, does this improve the overall performance of the application?Thanks! <code> ",Does passing Reference Types using ref save memory?

Difference Between Extension Method and Member Method?," Consider this code: Will the above throw NullReferenceException?The answer is : it depends on what f() is. If it's a member method, then yes, it will throw exception. If it's an extension method, then no, it will not throw any extension.This difference leads to a question: how each type of method is implemeneted and viewed by C# compilers? Also, why member method must throw exception even if it doesn't access any member data? It seems that C# compiler makes an assumption in advance that member method will access member data, and so it throws exception if the object is null, as using null object member data cannot be accessed. However, in case of extension method, it postpones this decision till it actually attempts to access member data using null reference, only then it throws exception.How far my understanding is correct? And if that is so, why this difference?Yes, I know that if f() is an extension method, then a.f() is equivalent to writing AExt.f(a), so the latter shouldn't throw exception until a is used to access member. But my focus is mostly on the compiler implementations (which can implement even member methods in the same way). <code>  A a = null; a.f(); //Will it throw NullReferenceException?",Extension Method and Member Method :  why each is implemented differently by compilers (internally)?

C# Managed PNG Optimization Library Available?," I am looking to build in PNG optimization (a PNG ""sqeezer/squisher"" of sorts) into my builds (TFS 2010 Build Workflow). I want to create a new build activity and as with all my activities, I prefer to have all my code managed with little to no dependencies.I have searched (Googled) and found many different PNG libraries for PNG optimiaztion. PNGOUT, PNGCRUSH, OptiPNG, etc. None of them are really .NET. They all seem like great tools. I prefer not to call EXE files (separate processes) from my code activity because you never really know what will happen (less reliable).So i thought maybe PNGGauntlet would be an option.

REGEX error in C#: [x-y] range in reverse order," I am creating a Regex and so far I did this and tried it, and I get the following error.

Is that a bug? or am I missing something?UpdateThanks guys for pointing out that ""-"" is assumed as range if it is in middle or not escaped by ""\"".

How Inteface can achieve Multiple Inheritance," In many books it is written that interfaces are a replacement of multiple inheritance, but I don't find any similarity between both of them. Inheritance is mostly important for re-usability of code and functionality and multiple inheritance was helping to re-use code from more than one class, but in interface I didn't find any such feature except that a class can inherit from more than one interface. Interface is just declaration of functions/methods and it didn't contain any implementation part by itself, so class which are inheriting this interface should have to write their own implementation code. So I don't feel any re-usability of code in case of interface. Is any document or link which will clear my doubts with you answer please share. <code> ",How interfaces achieve multiple inheritance
Learning SRP with C#," I am trying to learn the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) but it is being quite difficult as I am having a huge difficult to figure out when and what I should remove from one class and where I should put/organize it.I was googling around for some materials and code examples, but most materials I found, instead of making it easier to understand, made it hard to understand. For example if I have a list of Users and from that List I have a class Called Control that does lots of things like Send a greeting and goodbye message when a user comes in/out, verify weather the user should be able to enter or not and kick him, receive user commands and messages, etc.From the example you don't need much to understand I am already doing too much into one class but yet I am not clear enough on how to split and reorganize it afterwards.If I understand the SRP, I would have a class for joining the channel, for the greeting and goodbye, a class for user verification, a class for reading the commands, right ?But where and how would I use the kick for example ?I have the verification class so I am sure I would have all sort of user verification in there including weather or not a user should be kicked.So the kick function would be inside the channel join class and be called if the verification fails ?For example: Would appreciate if you guys could lend me a hand here with easy to understand C# materials that are online and free or by showing me how I would be splitting the quoted example and if possible some sample codes, advice, etc. <code>  public void UserJoin(User user){ if (verify.CanJoin(user)) { messages.Greeting(user); } else { this.kick(user); }}",Learning Single Responsibility Principle with C#

Can this be replaced with a Linq query?," I have a Message object which wraps a message format I do not have control over. The format is a simple list of Key/Value pairs. I want to extract a list of Users from a given Message. For example given the following message... I want to extract four Users with the provided properties set. The initial keys 200/300....405 represent fields I don't need and can skip to get to the User data.

EF Competing SaveChanges() Calls," I am building a batch processing system. Batches of Units come in quantities from 20-1000. Each Unit is essentially a hierarchy of models (one main model and many child models). My task involves saving each model hierarchy to a database as a single transaction (either each hierarchy commits or it rolls back). Unfortunately EF was unable to handle two portions of the model hierarchy due to their potential to contain thousands of records. What I've done to resolve this is set up SqlBulkCopy to handle these two potentially high count models and let EF handle the rest of the inserts (and referential integrity).Batch Loop: Unit: Right now I'm essentially stuck between a rock and a hard place. If I leave the IsolationLevel set to ReadCommitted, I get deadlocks between EF INSERT statements in different Tasks. If I set the IsolationLevel to ReadUncommitted (which I thought would be fine since I'm not doing any SELECTs) I get DbConcurrencyExceptions.I've been unable to find any good information about DbConcurrencyExceptions and Entity Framework but I'm guessing that ReadUncommitted is essentially causing EF to receive invalid ""rows inserted"" information.UPDATEHere is some background information on what is actually causing my deadlocking issues while doing INSERTS:http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/562148/how-to-avoid-using-scope-identity-based-insert-commands-on-sql-server-2005Apparently this same issue was present a few years ago when Linq To SQL came out and Microsoft fixed it by changing how scope_identity() gets selected.

Here is my C++ code. I'm guessing I've done something a bit drastically wrong. Here is the C# version: Sorry this is so specific, but I'm stumped.EDIT - A lot of people have said they have tested this code, and it takes mere seconds for them. All I know is, if I comment out the call to this function, the program loads in seconds. With the function call it takes 5 minutes. Almost exactly. I'm really stumped. What could the problem be?Here is the PathTable it's using.EDIT - I tried running the function in a program on its own, and it took a few seconds, but I'm afraid I don't know enough to be able to know how to fix this problem. Obviously it's not the code. What could it be? I checked where it's being called to see if there were multiple calls, but there aren't. It's in a constructor of the game's level and that is only called once.EDIT - I understand that the code is not the best it could be, but that isn't the point here. It runs quickly on its own - about 3 seconds and that's fine for me. The problem I'm trying to solve is why it takes so much longer inside the project.EDIT - I commented out all of the game code apart from the main game loop. I placed the method into the initialize section of the code which is run once on start up. Apart from a few methods setting up a window it's now pretty much the same as the program with ONLY the method in, only it STILL takes about 5 minutes to run. Now I know it has nothing to do with dependencies on the pathLookupVectors. Also, I know it's not a memory thing where the computer starts writing to the hard drive because while the slow program is chugging away running the method, I can open another instance of Visual Studio and run the single method program at the same time which completes in seconds. I realise that the problem might be some basic settings, but I'm not experienced so apologies if this does disappointingly end up being the reason why. I still don't have a clue why it's taking so much longer. <code>  0 12 5 16 n //Parses the text path vector into the enginevoid Level::PopulatePathVectors(string pathTable){ // Read the file line by line. ifstream myFile(pathTable); for (unsigned int i = 0; i < nodes.size(); i++) { pathLookupVectors.push_back(vector<vector<int>>()); for (unsigned int j = 0; j < nodes.size(); j++) { string line; if (getline(myFile, line)) //Enter if a line is read successfully { stringstream ss(line); istream_iterator<int> begin(ss), end; pathLookupVectors[i].push_back(vector<int>(begin, end)); } } } myFile.close();} private void PopulatePathLists(string pathList){ // Read the file and display it line by line.

LINQ to SQL: How Can I define Nullable EntitySet<>?," For each entity that has a one to many relation with other entity when i trying to add a new item it seems like i have to define these list of items that relates to this entity.For example, lets say that i have a ProductType entity that has a list of Products as following: when i try to add a new ProductType like that: it gives me an exception that Products is null: the same problem with all the entities that has a one to many relation with other entities. so how can i allow null for the EntitySet<> that represents a one to many Relation <code>  [Table]public class ProductType{ [Column(IsPrimaryKey = true, IsDbGenerated = true)] public int Id { get; private set; } [Column] public string Name { get; set; } private EntitySet<Product> _products; [Association(Storage = ""_products"", ThisKey = ""Id"", OtherKey = ""ProductTypeId"")] public EntitySet<Product> Products { get { return _products; } set { _products.Assign(value); } }} ProductType newType = new ProductType { Name = ""newType"" };_productRepository.Add(newType); //InsertOnSubmit() and SaveChanges() Object reference not set to an instance of an object",How Can I define Nullable EntitySet<>?
Using an RSA Private Key to decrypt a string that was encrypted using RSA Public Key," I know the main answer I am likely to get is why the hell would you want to do that?! Unfortunately despite my protests I have to do it, even though I know it makes little sense.I have functions written in .Net to decrypt using a private key, encrypt using a public key.I also RSA sign and verify and have a reasonable understanding of how this all work I think.I am now being sent a value that is RSA encrypted using a private key which I am supposed to derive a usable value by decrypting using the public key.I can't seem to figure out how to do this. Am I being an idiot? Is this a normal thing to do?I am told by the person sending me the value that this is no problem in PHP. I don't know and haven't used PHP yet. I can't find a library to do it in any of the main languages I know i.e. C++, Java, C#. The server I am working on uses .Net.I am hoping someone might be able help me. It would be great if there is some kind of reasonable solution besides begging them to change what they are doing.This is my method (updated from my previous bad one as pointed out by Iridium) but when I try to decrypt the value I get an exception ""Error occurred while decoding OAEP padding.""If I use rsa.Decrypt(bytes, false) I get a bad key exception.

'Test.Integers' cannot implement 'ITest.Integers' because it does not have the matching return type of 'System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable'.As long as I can say my Test class implement the ITest contract because the List of int property is in fact an IEnumerable of int.So way the c# compiler is telling me about the error? <code>  interface ITest{ IEnumerable<int> Integers { get; set; }} class Test : ITest{ public List<int> Integers { get; set; }}",The return type of the members on an Interface Implementation must match exactly the interface definition?

C# - The performance cost to using ref instead of returning same types?," Hi this is something that's really bothering me and I'm hoping someone has an answer for me. I've been reading about ref (and out) and I'm trying to figure out if I'm slowing down my code using refs. Commonly I will replace something like: with because to my eyes this is easier to read AND code than this I know precisely what I'm doing on the code using ref, as opposed to returning a value. However, performance is something I take seriously, and apparently dereferencing and cleanup is a lot slower when you use refs.What I'd like to know is why every post I read says there is very few places you would typically pass a ref (I know the examples are contrived, but I hope you get the idea), when it seems to me that the ref example is smaller, cleaner and more exact.I'd also love to know why ref really is slower than returning a value type - to me it would seem to me, if I was going to edit the function value a lot before returning it, that it would be quicker to reference the actual variable to edit it as opposed to an instance of that variable shortly before it gets cleaned from memory. <code>  int AddToInt(int original, int add){ return original+add; } void AddToInt(ref int original, int add){ original+=add; } // 1st parameter gets the result AddToInt(ref _value, _add); _value = AddToInt(_value, _add);",The performance cost to using ref instead of returning same types?

Your best code improvements using LINQ," I've been reading about LINQ to Objects, and now my colleagues want me to present it to them. Now, I have an OK understanding of the operators and the syntax choices, but I've heard you can avoid heavy nested loops by using LINQ. I'm having trouble coming up with a good set of ""before and after"" code listings to demonstrate this though. I found a great example of sorting and grouping with and without LINQ in Magennis' book, and he also has an example of writing xml. But what about those nested loops? Is this even a realistic claim, given that we usually need a foreach loop or two to iterate over the results of the query anyway?If anyone can explain this idea to me (ideally with specific examples), I would greatly appreciate it. <code> ",How can I use LINQ to avoid nested loops?

How to properly architect a decoupled design," I am working on a game project using Microsoft XNA framework, although this question is a generic one that involves decoupling of classes/systems.Let's say i have a class (simplified to suit this example) as shown here: I would like to reuse as much code as i can between multiple platforms that use C#.The problem of directly referncing the Color struct is that this type is defined in the XNA assemblies, creating a strong coupling (or dependency) between my code and XNA.The other framework i will be using may (or may not) have its own Color object, with its own set of properties and API.I would like to have the same source file ""know"" to use either the XNA or other framework's implementation automagically.I know other types of decoupling methods such as IoC, but that would mean i would be plugging in different versions of a system/class, instead of reusing the same class in different contexts.Is this even possible to do? how would u suggest to keep such a system portable?I've seen some cases (in native C++ development) where you would define a set of classes that mirror the classes the framework you're using has (for example here - define Color again), and so it is possible to ""re-map"" this later on to use different classes, upon need.Another option is to mess around using #IFDEF to play with the using statements in the header of the class (switching from XNA to other platforms).What is the best alternative in this case? <code>  public class GameCell{ public Color Color { get; set; }}",How to properly decouple classes from frameworks (source level decoupling)

C# Many instances of a Singleton objetc," I'm having an issue with the Singleton pattern.It is really weird, but it looks like there are two or three instances of my Singleton Pattern.My website, is an actions site, with timers and I'm handling those timers and prices with my Singleton Object.What is happening is that some people see some prices, and other people see other prices always when they are in different networks.For example, In my office, my people see some auction at 0.56 cents, everybody sees the same, but in another network, for example, my house, I see 0.55 cents and also the timers have different values.Having said this, I've tested my Singleton, by generating a GUID and logging it in my log file. Here is some code In this code, I generate the token on the constructor, and log the creation of a new Singleton, then... in the SomeAction method, I log who is doing that action.After this, we made a couple of tests and downloaded the log file.To my surprise, I see only one ""New Singleton Instance bla"" which is correct. but then, many calls to the SomeAction Method with different GUIDs, which is weird.I checked that object is only created in the static constructor, and I also checked that there is no manual creation anywhere.For more information, this only happens on my production server, which is a goDaddy hosting. I've asked if there is more than one application pool for my website and they say there is only one app Pool. <code>  public class Singleton{ private static Singleton instance; private static System.Threading.Mutex mutex; System.Guid token; private Singleton() { token = System.Guid.NewGuid(); Logger.Log(""New singleton Instance"" + token.toString()); } static Singleton() { instance = new Singleton(); mutex = new System.Threading.Mutex(); } public static Singleton Acquire() { mutex.WaitOne(); return instance; } // Each call to Acquire() requires a call to Release() public static void Release() { mutex.ReleaseMutex(); } public void SomeAction() { Logger.Log(token.toString() + "" - SomeAction""); }}",C# Many instances of a Singleton object

Click Event noch fired in WPF Datagrid in unselected row," I have a DataGrid (WPF 4) like this: The issue I experience is, that a button of the DataGridTemplateColumn does not fire the click-event, if its row is not selected. So I have to click a button twice, one time to select its row and then to raise the click event.I read about similiar problems with checkbox-columns, but there the suggestion was obviously to use a template column. I tested to use the PreviewMouseDown-Event of the button, which works, but is not what I want, since then the button does not follow its usual grpahical click behaviour.What am I missing here? How can I get that click event by just clicking once, regardless of whether the row was selected or not? <code>  <DataGrid Margin=""0,0,0,5"" VerticalAlignment=""Top"" Height=""192"" BorderBrush=""#aaa"" Background=""White"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" ItemsSource=""{Binding Namen, Mode=OneWay}"" ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibility=""Visible"" AutoGenerateColumns=""False"" ColumnHeaderHeight=""24"" SelectionChanged=""DataGridAuslaendischeAlteNamen_SelectionChanged""> <DataGrid.Columns> <DataGridTextColumn Width=""*"" Header=""Namenseintrag"" Binding=""{Binding DisplayName, Mode=OneWay}"" /> <DataGridTextColumn Width=""75"" Header=""gltig von"" Binding=""{Binding GueltigAb, StringFormat=d, Mode=OneWay}"" /> <DataGridTextColumn Width=""75"" Header=""gltig bis"" Binding=""{Binding GueltigBis, StringFormat=d., Mode=OneWay}"" /> <DataGridTemplateColumn Width=""20"" IsReadOnly=""True""> <DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate> <DataTemplate> <Button Style=""{DynamicResource CaratRemoveButton}"" Click=""Button_Click"" CommandParameter=""{Binding}"" PreviewMouseDown=""Button_PreviewMouseDown"" /> </DataTemplate> </DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate> </DataGridTemplateColumn> </DataGrid.Columns> </DataGrid>",Click Event not fired in WPF Datagrid in unselected row

Redirecting Native DLL's STDOUT to Memory Stream?," How can I stream data (text) from a managed assembly to a native library and stream data (text) back to the managed assembly?Specifically, I want to expose a System.IO.Stream of some sort on the .NET side, and (most importantly) a FILE * on the native side.The signature of the native method should be:FILE * foo(FILE * bar);The signature of a wrapper around the native p/invoke call should be:CustomStream foo(CustomStream bar);I do not want to use callback methods on the native side (one for getting more data and one for setting more data). I want to use a FILE * on the native side - and all of the associated methods which operate upon it such as fprintf. I do not want any disk I/O. This needs to be an in-memory operation.I have complete control over both the managed assembly and the native library. The solution must work with .NET 2.0I'm willing to create any sort of managed or unmanaged shim layer required to pull this off.The ""obvious"" solution is to use STDIN and STDOUT and launch a child process - however I don't want a separate process. Also, my attempts to redirect the STDIN and STDOUT streams of a native library which isn't a console application on Windows have failed somewhat spectacularly (and with much head-banging).Based on this question:Redirect stdout+stderr on a C# Windows service I attempted to modify the approach to (at least) solve the ""response"" stream half of my problem - but without a FileStream (since I want something more analogous to a MemoryStream). However, FileStream is the only stream type which exposes a suitable low-level stream handle.Otherwise, I'm pretty well stuck and am currently thinking I'll need to dive deeper and come up with my own hand-rolled native<->managed stream implementation but don't really know where to start. SolutionFinally! I've posted a complete sample project here:http://pastebin.com/jcjHdnwzThis is for .NET 3.5 and uses the AnonymousPipeServerStream - but with a little bit of reflector-ing, it's easy enough to duplicate the inner workings of the AnonymousPipeServerStream in .NET 2.0.Thanks for your help shf301 for pointing me to the native pipe API, which got me looking into the Microsoft docs for a better understanding of what's going on, and for pointing out I needed to use the _open_osfhandle method to get the FILE * reference. <code> ",How can I stream data from a managed assembly to a native library and back again?

Grouping by week - C#," I am writing an Excel exporter for a bespoke application I am creating, and I have a question about LINQ grouping in C#.Basically, this new Excel exporter class is given two dates. The class then retrieves all consignments between this date range.As part of this exporter, I need to be able to group the dates into weeks, and get the values for that week. So for example, if I'm given 07/12/2011 and 22/12/2011 (dd/MM/yyyy format), I need to group all consignments between them ranges into weeks (each week beginning with Sunday). The ideal result using the above dates would be Any ideas? <code>  Week 1: (consignments between 04/12/2011 and 10/12/2011) Week 2: (consignments between 11/12/2011 and 17/12/2011) Week 3: (consignments between 18/11/2011 and 24/12/2011)",How to group dates by week?

Manipulating lines of data (C#)," I have millions of lines generated from data updated every second which look like this: The column on the left represents time (hhmmss format), and the column on the right is data which is updated second-by-second. As you can see however, it isn't actually second-by-second, and there are some missing times (10:45:04, 10:45:07, 10:45:08 are missing in this example). My goal is to add in the missing seconds, and to use the data from the previous second for that missing second, like this: I don't want the ""--"" in the result, I just put those there to mark the added lines. So far I've tried to accomplish this using StreamReader and StreamWriter, but it doesn't seem like they're going to get me what I want.

C# Mouse emulation in a different program," I'm working on my own software to operate the mouse on my computer using C# and the kinect SDK. I really want to try using it to play a game like Red Alert, or some sort of RTS, or even just for general navigation.The problem that I've found is that when using a program with a different mouse, like red alert or going into a virtual machine where mouse integration isn't supported, the program will not pick up on the calls that the C# program is making to the System.Windows.Forms.Cursor calls, let alone the mouse_event calls. I'm new to interfacing with windows and what is happening here, can someone explain/pose a solution?--UPDATE--As an update, I'm still not entirely sure what's going on, but I seem to have found a workaround for red alert in particular;Since red alert is a fairly low graphics program, it is trivial to run it within a virtual machine specifically for me, vmware workstation with an XP client. If you use the mouse_event code it works well, HOWEVER, something that I struggled with was finding the correct code to represent mouse movement. It would seem that the MOVE flag moves the mouse relatively, which I didn't want, and the absolute tag didn't move the mouse at all. It is, in fact, the OR of them that produces absolute movement on the screen, so my code for mouse movement and clicking emulation ended up looking like this: for clicking and for mouse movement, where x and y are the new coordinates out of 65535 (the absolute range). Is it perfect? Nah. But it works for now. I think there's something to do with the way windows ignores certain programs when it runs ra, maybe because of compatibility mode? I don't have another game to test it with right now, but I'll post results with a non-compatibility mode in the future.Pete(It wouldn't let me post as an answer for another two hours and I have to sleep to catch a flight in the morning!) <code>  mouse_event((int)0x00000002, cursor.X, cursor.Y, 0, 0); mouse_event((int)(0x00000001 | 0x00008000), x, y, 0 0);",Mouse emulation in a different program

Is Injection Possiable through Dynamic LINQ?," Using the Dynamic LINQ library (link), is it vulnerable to injection? and (if so) how can this be protected against?Some background from Security Considerations (Entity Framework): LINQ to Entities injection attacks: Although query composition is possible in LINQ to Entities, it is performed through the object model API. Unlike Entity SQL queries, LINQ to Entities queries are not composed by using string manipulation or concatenation, and they are not susceptible to traditional SQL injection attacks.Since Dynamic SQL is composed using strings does that mean that it might be susceptible to injection vectors? Or will LINQ to SQL automatically take care of parametrizing your values based on the underlying datatype within the Dynamic LINQ library?Or is it entirely safe since the dynamic query will be performed in memory rather than against the SQL (thereby negating any benefits from SQL indexes)?I have been working through understanding the DynamicLibrary.cs code but I'm sure I could be easily overlooking something.As this question is about the Dynamic LINQ Library itself, this question can be considered to apply to both linq-to-sql and linq-to-entities (despite above reference to Entity Framework). <code> ",Is Injection Possible through Dynamic LINQ?

If we relax the regime then the 3rdparty DLL will impact other builds and if I have two build which need two different versions I may have the wrong build compile against the wrong version (a very real possibility).QuestionAre there any other options besides registration to handle legacy DLLs which expose their interface via COM?Thanks for the helpPeter <code> ,How can C# use a legacy DLL simply without registration(regsvr32)

How to set CurrentUICulture/CurrentCulture correctly?," I'm working on a SL5 app with C# and I'm looking to internationalize it. I found the following to set the UI culture: Some controls like the DatePicker seem to pick this up. If I format any datetime by using the 'd' format string, I still get the default format ""M/dd/yyyy"" however.Exactly how does SL interpret culture and how can I set it correctly for the entire application?ThanksUPDATE:Found the answer:First of all, set the appropriate cultures in the Application_Startup: The key element however is to add the following to force the RootVisual's culture/language: <code>  var culture = new CultureInfo(Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture.TwoLetterISOLanguageName);Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = culture;Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = culture; var culture = new CultureInfo(""nl-BE"");Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = culture;Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = culture; var root = RootVisual as Page;if (root != null){ root.Language = XmlLanguage.GetLanguage(Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture.Name);}",How to set Silverlight CurrentUICulture/CurrentCulture correctly?
What version of Unicode is supported by the .NET platform or how can I use higher planes?," Updated question With regards to character classes, comparison, sorting, normalization and collations, what Unicode version or versions are supported by which .NET platforms?Original questionI remember somewhat vaguely having read that .NET supported Unicode version 3.0 and that the internal UTF-16 encoding is not really UTF-16 but actually uses UCS-2, which is not the same. It seems, for instance, that characters above U+FFFF are not possible, i.e. consider: and it stores the string ""9"".I'm basically looking for definitive references of answers to the following:If it isn't true UTF-16 in .NET, what is it?What version of Unicode is supported by .NET?If recent versions are not supported or planned in the near future, does anybody know of a (non)commercial library or how I can workaround this issue?) I updated the question as with passing time, it seems more appropriate with respect to the answers and to the larger community. I left the original question in place of which parts have been answered in the comments. Also the old UCS-2 (no surrogates) was used in now-ancient 32 bit Windows versions, .NET has always used UTF-16 (with surrogates) internally. <code>  string s = ""\u1D7D9""; // (""Mathematical double-struck digit one"") ",What version of Unicode is supported by which .NET platform and on which version of Windows in regards to character classes?

C# Visual Studio 2010 Track Bar Only fire event on final value not ever time value changes," I am working on a pretty basic C# visual studio forms application but am having some issue getting the track bar to act as I want it to so hoping someone in the community might have a solution for this. What I have is a pretty basic application with the main part being a track bar with a value of 0 to 100. The user sets the value of the track to represent ""the amount of work to perform"" at which point the program reaches out to some devices and tells them to do ""x"" amount of work (x being the value of the trackbar). So what I do is use the track bars scroll event to catch when the track bars value has changed and inside the handler call out to the devices and tells them how much work to do.My issue is that my event handler is called for each value between where the track bar currently resides and where ever it ends. So if it is slid from 10 to 30, my event handler is called 20 times which means I am reaching out to my devices and telling them to run at values I don't even want them to run at. Is there someway only to event when scroll has stopped happening so you can check the final value? <code> ",Track Bar Only fire event on final value not ever time value changes

Accessing dictionary items instantiated in child thread.," I'm currently grappling with threads and hoping that someone can clearly explain how to resolve the following error.I have a global Dictionary<string, BitmapImage> dic which I instantiate in the main thread.The main thread creates a child thread to populate the dictionary with images.The main thread then tries to access the dictionary and throws an exceptionThe calling thread cannot access this object because a different thread owns itI have no issues accessing the dictionary itself e.g. dic.ContainsKey(""key"") works just fine, it's just when I try to access a BitmapImage in the dictionary that the error occurs.I'm guessing it's because BitmapImages stored in the dictionary are instantiated in the child thread and it's causing an issue - any ideas how I can get around this?I've looked at loads of threading tutorials and advice here but it seems like everywhere else tells you how to access a parent thread object from a child thread whereas I'm trying to do the opposite.Thanks. <code> ",Accessing dictionary items instantiated in child thread

How to deal with run-time parameters when using instance scoping?," Warning, long post ahead.I've been thinking a lot about this lately and I'm struggling to find a satisfying solution here. I will be using C# and autofac for the examples.The problemIoC is great for constructing large trees of stateless services. I resolve services and pass the data only to the method calls. Great.Sometimes, I want to pass a data parameter into the constructor of a service. That's what factories are for. Instead of resolving the service I resolve its factory and call create method with the parameter to get my service. Little more work but OK.From time to time, I want my services to resolve to the same instance within a certain scope. Autofac provides InstancePerLifeTimeScope() which is very handy. It allows me to always resolve to the same instance within an execution sub-tree. Good.And there are times when I want to combine both approaches. I want data parameter in constructor and have have the instances scoped. I have not found a satisfying way to accomplish this.Solutions1. Initialize methodInstead of passing data into the constructor, just pass it to Initialize method.Interface: Class: Registration: Usage: After resolving the service for the first time and calling Initialize I can happily resolve within the same context and get the same initialized instance. I don't like the fact that before calling Initialize I have an unusable object. There is a danger that the instance will be resolved and used somewhere else before I call Initialize().2. Holder patternThis is a pattern that holds a reference to the data object and instead of injecting the data object itself I inject the holder object.Interface: Class: Registration: Usage: This is a little bit better as I moved the responsibility of holding an instance to a different class. I can now use the holder in other services too. Other advantage is that I can hot swap data in holder if necessary. I don't like the fact that it obfuscates the code and adds another interface I have to mock during testing.3. Let container hold the instanceInterface: Class: Registration: Usage: That's right. I don't store the result of a factory call anywhere, because autofac stores it for me. This is pretty surprising to anybody who will read the code. I'm not sure if autofac was even meant to be used like this. Nice thing about this is that I need neither an extra initialize method nor extra class for holding instance.QuestionWhat is your take on this? How do you handle a situation with run-time data parameters and lifetime scoping? Am I missing a better approach? <code>  interface IMyService{ void Initialize(Data data); void DoStuff();} class MyService : IMyService{ private Data mData; public void Initialize(Data data) { mData = data; } public void DoStuff() { //... }} builder.RegisterType<MyService>().As<IMyService>().InstancePerLifetimeScope(); var myService = context.Resolve<IMyService>();myService.Init(data);// somewhere elsevar myService = context.Resolve<IMyService>(); interface IMyService{ void DoStuff();} class MyService : IMyService{ private Data mData; public MyService(IDataHolder dataHolder) { mData = dataHolder.Data; } public void DoStuff() { //... }} builder.RegisterType<MyService>().As<IMyService>();builder.RegisterType<DataHolder>().As<IDataHolder>().InstancePerLifetimeScope(); var holder = context.Resolve<IDataHolder>();holder.Data = data;// somewhere elsevar myService = context.Resolve<IMyService>(); interface IMyService{ void DoStuff();} class MyService : IMyService{ private Data mData; public MyService(Data data) { mData = dataHolder.Data; } public void DoStuff() { //... }} builder.RegisterType<MyService>().As<IMyService>().InstancePerLifetimeScope(); var myServiceFactory = context.Resolve<Func<Data, IMyService>>();myServiceFactory(data);// somewhere elsevar myService = context.Resolve<IMyService>();",How to deal with run-time parameters when using lifetime scoping?

Flatten IEnumerable<IEnumerable<>>; understanding generics," I wrote this extension method (which compiles): The code below causes a compile time error (no suitable method found), why?: If I implement the extension like below, I get no compile time error: Edit(2): This question I consider answered, but it raised another question regarding overload resolution and type constraints. This question I put here: Why aren't type constraints part of the method signature? <code>  public static IEnumerable<J> Flatten<T, J>(this IEnumerable<T> @this) where T : IEnumerable<J>{ foreach (T t in @this) foreach (J j in t) yield return j;} IEnumerable<IEnumerable<int>> foo = new int[2][];var bar = foo.Flatten(); public static IEnumerable<J> Flatten<J>(this IEnumerable<IEnumerable<J>> @this){ foreach (IEnumerable<J> js in @this) foreach (J j in js) yield return j;}",Flatten IEnumerable<IEnumerable<>>; understanding generics
Understanding generics in C#: overload resolution and type constraints," UPDATE: As of C# 7.3, this should no longer be an issue. From the release notes: When a method group contains some generic methods whose type arguments do not satisfy their constraints, these members are removed from the candidate set.Pre C# 7.3:So I read Eric Lippert's 'Constraints are not part of the signature', and now I understand that the spec specifies that type constraints are checked AFTER overload resolution, but I'm still not clear on why this MUST be the case. Below is Eric's example: This doesn't compile because overload resolution for: Foo(new Giraffe()) infers that Foo<Giraffe> is the best overload match but then the type constraints fail and a compile-time error is thrown. In Eric's words: The principle here is overload resolution (and method type inference) find the best possible match between a list of arguments and each candidate methods list of formal parameters. That is, they look at the signature of the candidate method. Type constraints are NOT part of the signature, but why can't they be? What are some scenarios where it is a bad idea to consider type constraints part of the signature? Is it just difficult or impossible to implement? I'm not advocating that if the best chosen overload is for whatever reason impossible to call then silently fallback to the second best; I would hate that. I'm just trying to understand why type constraints can't be used to influence the choosing of the best overload.I'm imagining that internally in the C# compiler, for overload resolution purposes only (it doesn't permanently rewrite the method), the following: gets transformed to: Why can't you sort of ""pull in"" the type constraints into the formal parameter list? How does this change the signature in any bad way? I feel like it only strengthens the signature. Then Foo<Reptile> will never be considered as an overload candidate.Edit 2: No wonder my question was so confusing. I didn't properly read Eric's blog and I quoted the wrong example. I've edited in the example I think more appropriate. I've also changed the title to be more specific. This question doesn't seem as simple as I first imagined, perhaps I'm missing some important concept. I'm less sure that this is stackoverflow material, it may be best for this question/discussion to be moved elsewhere. <code>  static void Foo<T>(T t) where T : Reptile { }static void Foo(Animal animal) { }static void Main() { Foo(new Giraffe()); } static void Foo<T>(T t) where T : Reptile { } static void Foo(Reptile t) { }",Why aren't type constraints part of the method signature?

It would also be great if the event could get the Javascript code executed, or at least the function name in the arguments.EDIT:Even if the question is related to the webbrowser component, anything that allows the user to detect javascript activation (even via js) would be fine, being able to inject a js that handles the javascript event and passes it to the wb control triggering some event that it can handle. <code>  <a href=""javascript:void(0)"" onclick=""jsFunct();"">test</a> <script type=""text/javascript""> window.setTimeout(""jsFunct()"", 1000);</script>",How to detect Javascript execution in WebBrowser control

Dynamic View of ExpandoObjects drops Properties with null Values," I have some code that works with ExpandoObjects populated by database calls. Invariably some of the values are nulls. When I look at the objects as an ExpandoObject, I see all the keys and values (nulls included) in the underlying dictionary. But if I try to access them through a dynamic reference, any key that has a corresponding null value does not show up in the dynamic view of the object. I get an ArgumentNullException when I try to access it via property syntax on the dynamic reference.I know I could work around this by working directly with an ExpandoObject, adding a bunch of try catches, mapping the expando to a concrete type, etc., but that kind of defeats the purpose of having this dynamic object in the first place. The code that consumes the dyanmic object would work fine if some of the properties had null values. Is there a more elgent or succinct way of ""unhiding"" these dynamic properties that have null values?Here's code that demonstrates my ""problem"" <code>  dynamic dynamicRef = new ExpandoObject();ExpandoObject expandoRef = dynamicRef;dynamicRef.SimpleProperty = ""SomeString"";dynamicRef.NulledProperty = null;string someString1 = string.Format(""{0}"", dynamicRef.SimpleProperty);// My bad; this throws because the value is actually null, not because it isn't// present.

However, I can't figure out how to make the hosting interfaces do anything other than call a function with an int func(string) signature.Does anyone know how to call a C# function from C++ code with a different signature?(Note I cannot use C++/CLI for this. I need to use the hosting APIs.) <code>  int Foo(String arg) ICLRRuntimeHost *pClrHost = NULL;HRESULT hrCorBind = CorBindToRuntimeEx(NULL, L""wks"", 0, CLSID_CLRRuntimeHost, IID_ICLRRuntimeHost, (PVOID*)&pClrHost);HRESULT hrStart = pClrHost->Start();DWORD retVal;HRESULT hrExecute = pClrHost->ExecuteInDefaultAppDomain(L""C:\\Test.exe"", L""P"", L""Test"", L"""", &retVal); void SomeFunction(IFoo interface) IntPtr SomeFunction();",CLR Hosting: Call a function with an arbitrary method signature?
"Stackoverflow, Redis, and Cache invalidation"," Now that Stack Overflow uses redis, do they handle cache invalidation the same way? i.e. a list of identities hashed to a query string + name (I guess the name is some kind of purpose or object type name). Perhaps they then retrieve individual items that are missing from the cache directly by id (which bypasses a bunch of database indexes and uses the more efficient clustered index instead perhaps). That'd be smart (the rehydration that Jeff mentions?).Right now, I'm struggling to find a way to pivot all of this in a succinct way. Are there any examples of this kind of thing that I could use to help clarify my thinking prior to doing a first cut myself?Also, I'm wondering where the cutoff is between using a .net cache (System.Runtime.Caching or System.Web.Caching) and going out and using redis. Or is Redis just hands down faster?Here's the original SO question from 2009:https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6435/how-does-stackoverflow-handle-cache-invalidationA couple of other links:https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/69164/does-stackoverflow-use-caching-and-if-so-how/69172#69172https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/110320/stack-overflow-db-performance-and-redis-cache <code> ","Stack Overflow, Redis, and Cache invalidation"

Issue with VB.NET/C# data table Select statement," The following VB line, where _DSversionInfo is a DataSet, returns no rows: but inspection shows that the table contains rows with FileID's of 92, 93, 94, 90, 88, 89, 215, 216. The table columns are all of type string.Further investigation showed that using the ID of 88, 215 and 216 will only return rows if the number is quoted.ie _DSversionInfo.Tables(""VersionInfo"").Select(""FileID='88'"")All other rows work regardless of whether the number is quoted or not.Anyone got an explanation of why this would happen for some numbers but not others? I understand that the numbers should be quoted just not why some work and others don't?I discovered this in some VB.NET code but (despite my initial finger pointing) don't think it is VB.NET specific. <code>  _DSversionInfo.Tables(""VersionInfo"").Select(""FileID=88"")",Issue with data table Select statement

How can I check if a value can be casted to a generic type?," I have a method wrapping some external API call which often returns null. When it does, I want to return a default value. The method looks like this The problem is that (T)value might throw an invalid cast exception. So I thought I would change it to but this requires where T : struct, and I want to allow reference types as well.Then I tried adding an overload which would handle both. but I found you can't overload based on constraints.I realize I can have two methods with different names, one for nullable types and one for nonnullable types, but I'd rather not do that.Is there a good way to check if I can cast to T without using as? Or can I use as and have a single method which works for all types? <code>  public static T GetValue<T>(int input){ object value = ExternalGetValue(input); return value != null ? (T)value : default(T)} var value = ExternalGetValue(input) as Nullable<T>; public static T GetValue<T>(int input) where T : struct { ... }public static T GetValue<T>(int input) where T : class { ... }",How can I check if a value can be cast to a generic type?

ASP.NET: How to get user local time at Page_Load," I have a web page written in ASP.NET and I need to retrieve the end user's local time at Page_Load. I thought about using Javascript to get the local time (by using new Date()) but the problem is that the script is run after the server events. Any ideas on how to accomplish this?EDIT: My page is quite complex: it displays a chart with lots of calculated fields from a database, object/fields selection lists, etc; The customer now requested that it should consider the user's timezone and that the timezone should be determined automatically by the web page. The user date is important to determine the chart interval (which day to display data on).Data loading (since it is so complicated) is done in both Page_Load and Page_PreRender. Giving up these events would require a full page rewrite.FINAL SOLUTION INSPIRED BY ANSWER:Here is how I solved the problem eventually. I am keeping the local date in a cookie. Here is the method that sets the cookie: In my Master page I call this method on $(document).ready. On the page where I use this cookie I added the following code to Page_Init: Then I can just use the cookie value in the C# code.Thank you for your answers/comments! <code>  function SetLocalDateCookie() { var cookieName = 'LOCALDATE'; var localDate = new Date(); var realMonth = localDate.getMonth() + 1; var localDateString = localDate.getFullYear() + ""/"" + realMonth + ""/"" + localDate.getDate(); setCookie(cookieName, localDateString, 2); try { var exdate = new Date(); exdate.setDate(exdate.getDate() + 2); document.cookie = cookieName + ""="" + escape(localDateString) + "";expires="" + exdate.toGMTString(); } catch (e) { }} if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(CookieHandler.Instance.GetCookie(CookieKeys.LocalDate))){ Response.ClearContent(); Response.Write(@""<form id='local' method='post' name='local'> <script type='text/javascript'> SetLocalDateCookie(); document.getElementById('local').submit(); </script> </form>""); Response.Flush(); Response.End();}",How to get user local time at Page_Load

"async CTP: when the method return void, is the same that a task?"," I am trying the async CTP, the versin 4.5 that allow use async methods without needing to write the Begin/End methods.My first probe is to execute an async method that return void. I see a few examples and do the following: In my WPF project I have a textBox where to see the results and a button that execute the async method.In the async method, I use await, that is need because the method is async, and the TasEx.Run to create a new thread in which execute the code.My doubt is in this point. In a few examples that I see of how to create an async method that returns void, use this way, the Task.Run or TaskEx.Run.If I am not wrong, Task.Run create a new thread where to execute the method. Then why to use an async method, if with the Task, creating a new thread, I get what I want, not to block the main thread?Also, if the async method access some shared variable, I must be careful with the concurrency, right? So I don't know the advantage of using async methods, at least in this case.In fact, I use the same code without async and without await and the result is the same, the main program is not blocking and all works as I expect. The method is this: My question is, this is the correct way to use async when the method return void? <code>  private void btnAsync01_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e){ UpdateTxtLog(""click button: "" + System.DateTime.Now); method01Async(); UpdateTxtLog(""after ethod01Async: "" + System.DateTime.Now);}private async void method01Async(){ await TaskEx.Run(() => { UpdateTxtLog(""Enter method01Async: "" + System.DateTime.Now); Thread.Sleep(10000); UpdateTxtLog(""exit method01Async: "" + System.DateTime.Now); });} private void method01Async(){ TaskEx.Run(() => { UpdateTxtLog(""Enter method01Async: "" + System.DateTime.Now); Thread.Sleep(10000); UpdateTxtLog(""Exit method01Async: "" + System.DateTime.Now); });}","When the method return void, is the same that a task?"

Protobuf-net serialization/deserialization to/from byte[] without stream," I checked but seem to be unable to see how to directly serialize a class to a byte array and subsequently deserialize from a byte array using Marc Gravell's protobuf-net implementation. Edit: I changed the question and provided code because the original question of how to serialize into byte[] without having to go through stream was admittedly trivial. My apologies.Updated Question: Is there any way to not have to deal with generics and instead infer the type of the property ""MessageBody"" through reflection when it is passed through the constructor? I assume I cannot serialize object type, correct? The current solution looks very cumbersome in that I need to pass in the type of the MessageBody each time I instantiate a new Message. Is there a sleeker solution to this? I came up with the following: What I like to get to is something such as: Message newMsg = new Message(""Producer"", ""Consumer"", Foo);byte[] byteArray = newMsg.Serialize();andMessage msg = Message.Deserialize(byteArray);(where Deserialize is a static method and it always deserializes into an object of type Message and only needs to know what type to deserialize the message body into). <code>  class Program{ static void Main(string[] args) { Message<string> msg = new Message<string>(""Producer"", ""Consumer"", ""Test Message""); byte[] byteArray = msg.Serialize(); Message<string> message = Message<string>.Deserialize(byteArray); Console.WriteLine(""Output""); Console.WriteLine(message.From); Console.WriteLine(message.To); Console.WriteLine(message.MessageBody); Console.ReadLine(); }}[ProtoContract]public class Message<T>{ [ProtoMember(1)] public string From { get; private set; } [ProtoMember(2)] public string To { get; private set; } [ProtoMember(3)] public T MessageBody { get; private set; } public Message() { } public Message(string from, string to, T messageBody) { this.From = from; this.To = to; this.MessageBody = messageBody; } public byte[] Serialize() { byte[] msgOut; using (var stream = new MemoryStream()) { Serializer.Serialize(stream, this); msgOut = stream.GetBuffer(); } return msgOut; } public static Message<T> Deserialize(byte[] message) { Message<T> msgOut; using (var stream = new MemoryStream(message)) { msgOut = Serializer.Deserialize<Message<T>>(stream); } return msgOut; } }",Protobuf-net serialization/deserialization
How do i edit the MainWindow constructor of a WPF application?," My mainWindow needs to subscribe to some events from an object. The object is initialized before the MainWindow is created. I would like to pass this object to the mainWindow via its constructor.However I can't figure out from where the MainWindow constructor is called. Alternatively I tried to pass the object via a member function of the MainWindow, but the app.MainWindow is null before app.Run() is called. After app.Run() is called the code doesn't return until the program terminates.Another posibility would be storing the object in a static class and have the MainWindow access that, but this seems unnecessarily complicated.I realize I can just create the object in the MainWindow constructor, but that would mean having to put a lot of other code there as well, pretty much the entire Main function.How can I pass this object to my MainWindow?

why do I have to reference assemblies referenced by the assembly I reference? (sometimes)," I have an assembly A that defines an interface with some overloads: ...and an assembly B that references A (the binary, not the project) and calls one of the overloads: To be precise, it calls the System.Windows.Point overload of the InverseTransform method, because that is the type of the property Location in e. But when I build B in the IDE I get: error CS0012: The type 'System.Drawing.Point' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System.Drawing, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'.even though that's not even the overload I am calling.

C# - Own WinForms Control Flickers and Has Bad Performance," I have two problems with an own user control which uses bitmaps:It flickers if it's redrawn via .NET's 'Refresh' method.It has a bad performance.The control consists of three bitmaps:A static background image.A rotating rotor.Another image depending on rotor angle.All used bitmaps have a resolution of 500x500 pixels. The control works like this:https://www.dropbox.com/s/t92gucestwdkx8z/StatorAndRotor.gif (it's a gif animation)The user control should draw itself everytime it gets a new rotor angle. Therefore, it has a public property 'RotorAngle' which looks like this: Refresh raises the Paint event. The OnPaint event handler looks like this: But when I use this code - which works well in other own user controls - the user control is not drawn at all if control is double buffered via SetStyle(ControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffer, true). If I don't set this flag to true, the control flickers when being redrawn.In control constructor I set: First, I thought it flickers because the background is cleared everytime the control is drawn. Therefore, I set SetStyle(ControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint, true). But it didn't help.So, why does it flicker? Other controls work very well with this setup. And why is the controly not drawn if SetStyle(ControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffer, true).I found out that the control does not flicker if I invoke my Draw method directly after changing the property RotorAngle: But this results in a very bad performance, especially in full screen mode. It's not possible to update the control every 20 milliseconds. You can try it yourself. I will attach the complete Visual Studio 2008 solution below.So, why it is such a bad performance? It's no problem to update other (own) controls every 20 milliseconds. Is it really just due to the bitmaps?I created a simple visual Visual Studio 2008 solution to demonstrate the two problems:https://www.dropbox.com/s/mckmgysjxm0o9e0/WinFormsControlsTest.zip (289,3 KB)There is an executable in directory bin\Debug.Thanks for your help. <code>  public double RotorAngle{ get { return mRotorAngle; } set { mRotorAngle = value; Refresh(); }} private void StatorAndRotor2_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e){ // Draw the three bitmaps using a rotation matrix to rotate the rotor bitmap.

C# Recursion Limit when returning JSON," I ran into an annoying issue recently. I'm going to simplify my datamodel here, but the principle is just the same. I have a class ""User"". In that class I have a property that is a list of objects the user owns. I also have this class ""object"".

Now, what I'm trying to do is basically this When I load the page, it takes like 30 seconds and then I get the error ""RecursionLimit exceeded"".I guess this is because the objects are linking to each other.

"Mystical behavior of Dictionary<TKey, TSource>"," I'm working on a huge system based on Asp.net MVC 3.0 and working on Mono-2.10.8 (Windows 7).Everything was fine until a moment couple of days ago.Inside my API I have several utility classes using dictionaries. For example, like this one: And randomly I get exceptions like this: Most of the time everything is fine and KeyUtility works correct, but on rare occasions I get such an exception.Despite it looks like thread safety issue, the dictionary ReverseAlphabet is always accessed for reading only and never for writing. Once it's created in static constructor it's only accessed with TryGetValue. As I understand from MSDN article it should be thread safe in this case.Moreover, I haven't seen this problem before.What should I look at? I even can't create a reproduction as I have completely no idea what is wrong.Mono-2.10.8 and older versions proved to be stable with dictionaries. I've been using it for a couple of years intensively and have never seen this sort of exception before.How to fix this?UPD:I've remembered that near the time of the begining of troubles what i've done is statically linked mono with my executable (i'm embedding mono into my application). I simply downloaded sources of mono. Compilled it without any changes except i set up libmono's output to static library. I've also linked with libeay32 and sqlite3. All multithread (MT).

How to get good coverage of floating-point logic with Pex," I am hand-crafting new code.

Arithmetic constraints over floating point numbers are approximated by a translation to rational numbers, and heuristic search techniques are used outside of Z3 to find approximate solutions for floating point constraints....and also... Symbolic Reasoning. Pex uses an automatic constraint solver to determine which values are relevant for the test and the code-under-test. However, the abilities of the constraint solver are, and always will be, limited. In particular, Z3 cannot reason precisely about floating point arithmetic.Alternatively, do you know a tool under .NET that is better suited for the task of finding numerical anomalies under .NET?

protobuf-net support for serializing dictionary of object values?," i'm new to protocol buffers and I am using protobuf-net for VS2010. from what i'm reading here Dictionary in protocol buffers, it doesn't seem that protobuf can serialize a dictionary with object types as values. but here on his site i read this: Notes on types supported: custom classes that: are marked as data-contract have a parameterless constructor for Silverlight: are public many common primitives etc single dimension arrays: T[] List / IList Dictionary / IDictionary any type which implements IEnumerable and has an Add(T) method The code assumes that types will be mutable around the elected members. Accordingly, custom structs are not supported, since they should be immutable.which seems like it is supported.I can successfully compile a List of objects like so: This works fine for a List<SomeClass>. Why cannot I serialize using protobuf-net a Dictionary<int, SomeClass>?

thread safe event calls," A common practice to avoid race conditions (in multi-threaded apps) when triggering events is this: The problem (according to the book) is that ""this code could be optimized by the compiler to remove the local temp variable entirely. If this happens, this version of the code is identical to the first version, so a NullReferenceException is still possible"" According to CLR via C#, here is a better way to force the compiler to copy the event pointer. Here, CompareExchange changes the NewMail reference to null if it is null and does not alter NewMail if it is not null. In other words, CompareExchange doesn't change the value in NewMail at all, but it does return the value inside NewMail in an atomic, thread-safe way. Richter, Jeffrey (2010-02-12). CLR via C# (p. 265). OReilly Media - A. Kindle Edition. I am on .Net 4.0 framework, and not sure how this can possibly work, because Interlocked.CompareExchange expects a reference to a location, not a reference to a event. Either there is an error in the book, or I misinterpreted it. Has anyone implemented this method? Or have a better way to prevent race conditions here? UPDATEit was my mistake, the iterlocked code works. i just had wrong casting specified, but according to Bradley (below) it is not necessary in .net 2.0 and up on windows.  <code>  EventHandler<EventArgs> temp = SomeEvent;if (temp != null) temp(e);""Remember that delegates are immutable and this is why this technique works in theory.

C#.NET calculating directory sizes," I'm trying to calculate directory sizes in a way that divides the load so that the user can see counting progress. I thought a logical way to do this would be to first create the directory tree then do an operation counting the length of all the files.The thing that comes to me as unexpected is that the bulk of time (disk I/O) comes from creating the directory tree, then going over the FileInfo[] comes nearly instantly with virtually no disk I/O.I've tried with both Directory.GetDirectories(), simply creating a tree of strings of the directory names, and using a DirectoryInfo object, and both methods still take the bulk of the I/O time (reading the MFT of course) compared to going over all the FileInfo.Length for the files in each directory.I guess there's no way to reduce the I/O to make the tree significantly, I guess I'm just wondering why this operation takes significantly more time compared to going over the more numerous files?Also, if anyone could recommend a non-recursive way to tally things up (since it seems I need to just split up the enumeration and balance it in order to make the size tallying more responsive). Making a thread for each subdirectory off the base and letting scheduler competition balance things out would probably not be very good, would it?EDIT: Repository for this code <code> ",Calculating directory sizes

Getting the CurrentUserID from Websecurity directly after login," I have this website (C#/ASP.NET) with a form where the user can register for an account (it is the default template of VS11) and after everything is filled in and the user clicks to register, it creates the account and logs in the user (which works great).

I've put a breakpoint there to see the values of both ""currentuserid"" and ""WebSecurity.CurrentUserId"" but they only have a -1 value. Next step is the user gets redirected to the next page, and on that page these functions work.

const vs. readonly [NOT duplicate]," Today I found an article where a const field is called compile-time constant while a readonly field is called runtime constant. The two phrases come from Effective C#. I searched in MSDN and the language spec, find nothing about runtime constant.No offensive but I don't think runtime constant is a proper phrase. creates a variable named ""foo"", whose value is ""bar"", and the value is readonly, here it is a variable, no business on constant. A readonly variable is still a variable, it can't be a constant. Variable and constant are mutually exclusive.Maybe this question goes overboard, still I want to listen to others' opinions. What do you think? <code>  private readonly string foo = ""bar"";",const vs. readonly

C# compiler generated sealed class for delegate keyword contains virtual methods," When delegate keyword is used in C#, the C# compiler automatically generates a class derived from System.MulticastDelegate class.This compiler generated class contains 3 methods as well: Invoke, BeginInvoke and EndInvoke.All these three methods are marked public virtual extern but interestingly the class itself is marked sealed.Virtual methods defined in a sealed class not only strikes as counter-intuitive but are actually illegal in C#.So my question is, is there a specific reason for this or is it just one of those harmless things done keeping in mind some hypothetical future enhancement?Edit 1:Can the reason be to force use of 'callVirt' IL opcode as opposed to 'call' so that delegate object is always checked for null by the CLR before trying to execute any of the three methods? Though I fail to see why a delegate should be a special case in this respect.Also isn't it a performance hit to force use of callvirt (though it may be minuscule)Edit 2:Added CIL tag, as it turns out that the C# way of defining delegates is in fact mandated by the CIL standard. Standard states that (following is not full text) Delegates shall have a base type of System.Delegate. Delegates shall be declared sealed, and the only members a delegate shall have are either the first two or all four methods as specified here. These methods shall be declared runtime and managed. They shall not have a body, since that body shall be created automatically by the VES. Other methods available on delegates are inherited from the class System.Delegate in the Base Class Library. The delegate methods are: The instance constructor The Invoke method shall be virtual The BeginInvoke method, if present, shall be virtual The EndInvoke method shall be virtual So this is definitely not a side effect of compiler process or is similar to other interesting compiler outputs.If standard emphasizes something, it must be for some good reason and rationale. So the question now is why does CIL standard for delegates emphasizes on sealed and virtual at the same time?Does the catch lie here?: They shall not have a body, since that body shall be created automatically by the VES.Are they marked virtual so that the VES/CLR generated body can be executed on invocation of these methods? <code> ",Compiler generated sealed class for delegate keyword contains virtual methods

Convert.ToInt32 rounds to the nearest even number?," Looking at the msdn documentation for Convert.ToInt32() it states: If value is halfway between two whole numbers, the even number is returned; that is, 4.5 is converted to 4, and 5.5 is converted to 6.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ffdk7eyz.aspxWhy is this?

Where to convert model to view model?," In my ASP.NET MVC application, I am using unit of work and repository patterns for data access. Using the unit of work class and the repository defined inside it I am fetching the related set of entities in my controller. With my beginner knowledge, I can think of two ways to fetch the business model and convert it to view model.Repository returns the business model to controller, this model than mapped to view model, orRepository itself converts business model to view model and then it is returned to controller. Currently I am using first approach, but my controller code started to look ugly and long for view models with lots of properties.On the other hand, I am thinking, since my repository is called UserRepository (for example), it should be returning the business model directly, instead of some model that is useful only for single view. Which one of these do you think is better practice for large projects ? Is there an alternative way ? <code> ",Where to convert business model to view model?
C# equivalent of Java FileChannel?," I want to stream bytes directly from a TCP socket to a file on disk. In Java, it's possible to use NIO Channels, specifically SocketChannel and FileChannel. Quoting FileChannel#transferFrom(...): This method is potentially much more efficient than a simple loop that reads from the source channel and writes to this channel. Many operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the source channel into the filesystem cache without actually copying them.Obviously I can just write the standard ""copy loop"" to read and write the bytes, and even take advantage of asynchronous I/O to minimize waiting. Will that be comparable to the platform native functionality that Java is taking advantage of, or is there another approach? <code> ",.NET equivalent of Java FileChannel?

Difference between abstract and protected in my scenario - C#," What is the difference between a public abstract class with a public constructor, and a public class with a protected constructor. We don't have any functions that are abstract in our abstract class, but we want programmers to only be capable of creating objects that extend that class.Both scenarios compile and work, however I don't understand which would be better to use in what scenario. I have been brought up to understand that although you cannot instantiate an abstract class directly (only through a non abstract child class), the abstract class should normally contain abstract functions that are required to be implemented by the children of that class.Wouldn't having a protected constructor in a public class signify that instantiation of this class is not possible (this is the only constructor we have). <code> ",Whats the difference between abstract and protected in my scenario - C#

WPF how to detect unresponsive UI updates?," Suppose I have a WPF application where I have the following architecture:[Worker Thread] -> [Queue 1] -> [Queue Manager Thread] -> [Queue 2] -> [UI Thread]The Worker is listening to data from some service and receives that data at indeterminate times (could be multiple times per second or a few times every few seconds) then queues it to Queue 1, then the Queue Manager, depending on the ""health"" of the UI thread may decide to throttle up / down the rate that data items are queued to Queue 2, which the UI thread uses to update the UI, maybe dropping a few items, so as not to overwhelm the UI thread in the event it is receiving too many messages (eg it might decide that it will check the timestamp of each data message and only enqueue it to Queue 2 if the difference between messages is at least 5 seconds older than the last data item the UI updated itself with)The UI thread will have a timer that fires a set-interval to update the UI with new data from Queue 2. What I'd like to be able to do is determine how fast the UI is updating itself to measure it's ""responsiveness"" in order to throttle eg increase / decrease the timer-interval as to how often to update the UISuppose my UI had lots of controls (grids, charts etc) all bound to different filtered / grouped subsets of the data on Queue 2 in my UI shell and the UI starts becoming unresponsive and freeze between updates when updating those controls, how could I detect this from code in order to know how / when to increase / decrease the interval for UI updates?

The values of original Row are then free to change but we still have another saved copy which doesn't change. Is this the correct way to do it? Will this just set Snapshot's ItemArray reference to point to the one in Source or does it actually make a separate copy? Should I do this instead? EDIT: I don't think the second code snippet actually compiles. <code>  DataRow Source, Destination;// Assume we create some columns and fill them with valuesDestination.ItemArray = Source.ItemArray; Destination.ItemArray = Source.ItemArray.Clone();",Simple way to copy or clone a DataRow?

Do Code First classes need foreign object references?," I have some domain classes that look something like this, that I want to model with Code First (in EF 4.3). In every example I see though, foreign object references are added in the Foo class. Can my Foo class be agnostic of the Bar and Baz class, or do I really need to do something like this? According to this answer, classes do need to have navigation properties. I'm new at Code First, so can anyone explain why this might be the case? Is there a way I can avoid polluting my Foo class like this by using the Fluent API?It seems weird to me that Foo would need to know about every class that uses it. Is my design simply fundamentally flawed in some way? <code>  public class Foo { // ...}public class Bar { // ... public Foo Foo { get; set; }}public class Baz { // ... public Foo Foo { get; set; }} public class Foo { // ... public virtual Bar { get; set; } public virtual Baz { get; set; }}",Why do Code First classes need navigation properties?

WPF MVVM: Bind button in DataTemplate to command in the form's ViewModel," My problem is similar to the one described in this question:WPF MVVM Button Control Binding in DataTemplateHere is my XAML: It's just a ListBox, bound to an ObservableCollection<string> named CommandSets (which is in the ViewModel).This binding works (it displays a button for each item in the collection).Now I want to bind the button to a command (FireCommand), which is also in the ViewModel.Here's the relevant part of the ViewModel: The binding of this button does NOT work.From what I've understood from the question I linked above, the binding doesn't work because:(correct me if I'm wrong)The button is inside the ListBox, so it only ""knows"" the binding of the ListBox (the ObservableCollection, in this case), but not the binding of the main windowI'm trying to bind to a command in the main ViewModel of the main window (which the button doesn't ""know"")The command itself is definitely correct, because when I put the button outside the ListBox (see the XAML above for an example), the binding works and the command is executed. Apparently, I ""just"" need to tell the button to bind to the main ViewModel of the form.But I'm not able to figure out the right XAML syntax.I tried several approaches that I found after some googling, but none of them worked for me: Could someone please:give me the proper XAML to bind the button inside the ListBox to a command in the form's MainViewModel?point me to a link where this advanced binding stuff is explained in a way that a WPF/MVVM beginner can understand?I'm feeling like I'm just copying and pasting arcane XAML incantations, and so far I don't have any clue (and can't find any good documentation) how I would figure out by myself in which cases I'd need RelativeSource or StaticResource or whatever instead of a ""normal"" binding. <code>  <Window x:Class=""MissileSharp.Launcher.MainWindow"" xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"" xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"" Title=""MissileSharp Launcher"" Height=""350"" Width=""525""> <Grid> <!-- when I put the button here (outside the list), the binding works --> <!--<Button Content=""test"" Command=""{Binding Path=FireCommand}"" />--> <ListBox ItemsSource=""{Binding CommandSets}""> <ListBox.ItemTemplate> <DataTemplate> <!-- I need the button here (inside the list), and here the binding does NOT work --> <Button Content=""{Binding}"" Command=""{Binding Path=FireCommand}"" /> </DataTemplate> </ListBox.ItemTemplate> </ListBox> </Grid></Window> public class MainWindowViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged{ public ICommand FireCommand { get; set; } public ObservableCollection<string> CommandSets { get; set; } public MainWindowViewModel() { this.FireCommand = new RelayCommand(new Action<object>(this.FireMissile)); } private void FireMissile(Object obj) { System.Windows.MessageBox.Show(""fire""); }} <Button Content=""{Binding}"" Command=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Window}, Path=DataContext.FireCommand}"" /><Button Content=""{Binding}"" Command=""{Binding Path=FireCommand, Source={StaticResource MainWindow}}"" /><Button Content=""{Binding}"" Command=""{Binding Path=FireCommand, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type Window}}}"" />",Bind button in DataTemplate to command in the form's ViewModel

Is async and await exclusively for GUI-based (Winforms/WPF) asynchronous programming?," I've been reading about the new async and await operators in C# and tried to figure out in which circumstances they would possibly be useful to me. I studied several MSDN articles and here's what I read between the lines:You can use async for Windows Forms and WPF event handlers, so they can perform lengthy tasks without blocking the UI thread while the bulk of the operation is being executed. A method using await must be async, which means that the usage of any async function somewhere in your code ultimately forces all methods in the calling sequence from the UI event handlers up until the lowest-level async method to be async as well.In other words, if you create a thread with an ordinary good old ThreadStart entry point (or a Console application with good old static int Main(string[] args)), then you cannot use async and await because at one point you would have to use await, and make the method that uses it async, and hence in the calling method you also have to use await and make that one async and so on. But once you reach the thread entry point (or Main()), there's no caller to which an await would yield control to.So basically you cannot use async and await without having a GUI that uses the standard WinForms and WPF message loop. I guess all that makes indeed sense, since MSDN states that async programming does not mean multithreading, but using the UI thread's spare time instead; when using a console application or a thread with a user defined entry point, multithreading would be necessary to perform asynchronous operations (if not using a compatible message loop).My question is, are these assumptions accurate? <code>  async void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e){ // even though this call takes a while, the UI thread will not block // while it is executing, therefore allowing further event handlers to // be invoked. await SomeLengthyOperationAsync();}",Is async and await exclusively for GUI-based asynchronous programming?

Using base and this in constructor chaining C# .NET 4.0," Say there is a base class called Employee that looks like the following And a class Manager which inherits from Employee with a constructor like To the best my understanding, the this keyword is just like the base keyword only it applies to constructors in the same class. My biggest question is, while reading a reference book, it says if you don't use the chaining the construction of a Manager object will include seven 'hits'. Since Manager inherits from Employees, does this mean that every Manager object is 'born' as an Employee and then becomes a Manager later? And after it is a manager you only have two fields to add instead of seven? <code>  public Employee(string name, int id, float pay) : this(name, 0, id, pay, """") { }public Employee(string name, int age, int id, float pay, string ssn){ // Better! Use properties when setting class data. // This reduces the amount of duplicate error checks. Name = name; Age = age; ID = id; Pay = pay; SocialSecurityNumber = ssn;} public Manager(string fullName, int age, int empID, float currPay, string ssn, int numbOfOpts) : base(fullName, age, empID, currPay, ssn){ .

Portable class library:recommended replacement for [Serializable]," I am porting a .NET Framework C# class library to a Portable Class Library. One recurring problem is how to deal with classes decorated with the [Serializable] attribute, since this attribute is not part of the Portable Class Library subset. Serialization functionality in the Portable Class Library subset instead appears to be covered by DataContractAttribute.To preserve as much of functionality as possible in the Portable Class Library, is it sufficient to replace [Serializable] with the [DataContract] attribute (with the implication that all fields and properties subject to serialization would need to be decorated with [DataMember] as well)? What (if anything) will I not be able to do with this approach that I can do with [Serializable] applied? Is there a less intrusive approach?Given that [DataContract] and [DataMember] are used, I am considering to change the code along the following lines. Are there any obvious flaws with this approach? Is there any way to formulate the same thing less verbose? <code>  #if PORTABLE [DataContract]#else [Serializable]#endif public class SerializableClass : SerializableBaseClass { ...#if !PORTABLE protected SerializableClass(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) : base(info, context) { }#endif ...#if PORTABLE [DataMember]#endif private Type1 _serializableField;#if PORTABLE [DataMember]#endif private Type2 SerializableProperty { get; set; } ... }",Portable class library: recommended replacement for [Serializable]

How to work out if a file has been modified - C#," I'm writing a back up solution (of sorts). Simply it copies a file from location C:\ and pastes it to location Z:\To ensure the speed is fast, before copying and pasting it checks to see if the original file exists. If it does, it performs a few 'calculations' to work out if the copy should continue or if the backup file is up to date. It is these calculations I'm finding difficult.Originally, I compared the file size but this is not good enough because it would be very possible to change a file and it to be the same size (for example saving the character C in notepad is the same size as if I saved the Character T). So, I need to find out if the modified date differs. At the moment, I get the file info using the FileInfo class but after reviewing all the fields there is nothing which appears to be suitable. How can I check to ensure that I'm copying files which have been modified?EDIT I have seen suggestions on SO to use MD5 checksums, but I'm concerned this may be a problem as some of the files I'm comparing will be up to 10GB <code> ",How to work out if a file has been modified?

The problem is that the async operation takes some time and I want method responsible for process execution to end after all async IO operations are done.I have code like this: Now I'm looking for a way how to tell the program to wait until all IO (OnRecvStdOut) operations are done.I though about using one of System.Threading classes, but I'm not sure which class is the best for this and how to do this after all, the best way would probably be: And in main function: Note: I'd like to allow both StdErr and StdOut to be processed in parallel. Something can't rely that Wait will be called as much as Signal, because Increase() and DecreaseAndSignal() pairs will be called many times before Wait occurs.The second thing that came to mind was something that would be able to signal many times (without requirement to process signals) and use loop in main function like: Edit: Current working solution:I came up with this what seems to be working: But I'd appreciate any notes how to do this ""good practice way"" or what are possible risks of implementation I though of. <code>  using System.Diagnostics;Process process = new Process();// ...process.OutputDataReceived += new DataReceivedEventHandler(this.OnRecvStdOut);process.ErrorDataReceived += new DataReceivedEventHandler(this.OnRecvStdErr);// ...process.Start();process.BeginOutputReadLine();process.BeginErrorReadLine();// ...process.WaitForExit(); public void OnRecvStdOut(...){ something.Increase(); // the stuff that takes so long something.DecreaseAndSignal();} something.WaitUntilZero(); while( ioOperations > 0){ something.WaitForSignal(500);} using System.Threading;protected int IOCount = 0;protected AutoResetEvent _IOSyncEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);public void OnRecvStdOut(...){ Interlocked.Increase( ref IOCount); // the stuff that takes so long Interlocked.Decrease( ref IOCount); IOSyncEvent.Set();}// After process.WaitForExit()while( IOCount > 0){ // 250 for a case that signal occurs after condition and before wait IOSyncEvent.WaitOne(250); }",Synchronization of asynchronous reading from stdout of child process

Why adding suspendLayout and resumeLayout reducing performance?," I need to add a lot of controls to a parent control.But I find if I add ParentControl.SuspendLayout and ParentControl.ResumeLayout before and after I add those controls to the parent, I use stopwatch to measure the ticks:If I remove the code ParentControl.SuspendLayout and ParentControl.ResumeLayout, it will be faster. Why does it happen?So SuspendLayout and ResumeLayout are not supposed to reduce the time to add sub controls, right?

Optimizing time it takes for an empty method to run in C#?," Ive been working on a C# maze generator for a while which can generate mazes of like 128000x128000 pixels. All memory usage is optimized already so Im currently looking at speeding the generation up.A problem (well more off an interest point) I found was the following (just some example code to illustrate the problem):This code runs in about 1.4 seconds on my machine when pixelChanged is null: Where the following code runs actually 0.4 seconds faster It seems that when just calling an empty method takes about 20% of the cpu this algorithm uses. Isnt this strange? Ive tried to compile the solution in debug and release mode but havent found any noticeable differences.What this means is that every method call I have in this loop will slow my code down by about 0.4 seconds. Since the maze generator code currently consist of a lot of seperate method calls that excecute different actions this starts to get a substantial ammount.I've also checked google and other posts on Stack Overflow but haven't really found a solution yet.Is it possible to automatically optimize code like this? (Maybe with things like project Roslyn???) or should I place everything together in one big method?Edit:I'm also interested in maybe some analysis on the JIT/CLR code differences in these 2 cases. (So where this problem actually comes from)Edit2:All code was compiled in release mode <code>  public void Go(){ for (int i = 0; i < bitjes.Length; i++) { BitArray curArray = bitjes[i]; for (int y = 0; y < curArray.Length; y++) { curArray[y] = !curArray[y]; GoDrawPixel(i, y, false); } }}public void GoDrawPixel(int i, int y, Boolean enabled){ if (pixelChanged != null) { pixelChanged.Invoke(new PixelChangedEventArgs(i, y, enabled)); }} public void Go(){ for (int i = 0; i < bitjes.Length; i++) { BitArray curArray = bitjes[i]; for (int y = 0; y < curArray.Length; y++) { curArray[y] = !curArray[y]; if (pixelChanged != null) { pixelChanged.Invoke(new PixelChangedEventArgs(i, y, false)); } } }}",What is the overhead for a method call in a loop?

IEnumerable vs ICollection vs IList," I need to design my own custom GenericCollection class.

C# - WCF error : 405 Method Not Allowed," Going nuts with this issue. I have a solution with 2 projects, one of them is a plain old html with jquery ajax call while the other is a WCF service.

C# wpf: Thumbs on line corner points do not relocate points," I am developing a drawing application in which one can draw various types of lines. On the line corner points I have placed a thumb using an itemsControl. The thumbs should move that corner point when the user left mouse clicks on it and drags the mouse. What's happening now is that when I do this the point and thumb move a little bit, but then it loses mouse capture right away and doesn't move anymore. When I debug the first dragdelta event that gets fired correctly has a full visual tree traced up from the sending thumb to the itemscontrol and beyond, but sometimes when it fires the next time, the thumb's location has not been updated, and the containing content presenter has null parents in the visual tree. This is the portion of the xaml related to the line thumb points: The code for PointRelocateThumb: }Tooline is the line class.

Best practice to call ConfigureAwait(false) for all server-side code (using ASP.NET Web API)," When you have server-side code (i.e. some ApiController) and your functions are asynchronous - so they return Task<SomeObject> - is it considered best practice that any time you await functions that you call ConfigureAwait(false)?I had read that it is more performant since it doesn't have to switch thread contexts back to the original thread context. However, with ASP.NET Web Api, if your request is coming in on one thread, and you await some function and call ConfigureAwait(false) that could potentially put you on a different thread when you are returning the final result of your ApiController function.I've typed up an example of what I am talking about below: <code>  public class CustomerController : ApiController{ public async Task<Customer> Get(int id) { // you are on a particular thread here var customer = await GetCustomerAsync(id).ConfigureAwait(false); // now you are on a different thread! will that cause problems? return customer; }}",Best practice to call ConfigureAwait for all server-side code

If I were to define a new string variable called AnotherString in the derived class, why wouldn't this work: Lastly, when you do this the right way and type out this... ...what is the first parameter in the SubClass constructor used for?

Maintaining and Deploying Two Versions of an Application Simulataneously," I have a C# WinForms application in Visual Studio 2010 that is used by two different customers. The basic functionality of the application is the same for each customer, but certain lines of code (names of stored procedures, resources, certain behaviors) are different between versions. So far, I have kept the application in the same project, and used preprocessor directives when building/publishing to switch between which deployment to use. However, the scope of the project has grown to a point where this is no longer feasible. Since so much of the code is shared, I'm trying to avoid duplicating source code files. I'm wondering what the best approach is to maintaining an application that requires different versions to be deployed simultaneously.  <code> ",Maintaining and Deploying Two Versions of an Application Simultaneously

But, suppose I had the following code: This works without issue, it defines a Container (Entity) and a Component (Position) that is contained inside it.However, if I invoke p.Site.Container, it will return Entity, but as IContainer. That is, I would have to explicitly do something like (Console.WriteLine(p.Site.Container as Entity).Foo); if I wanted to access Foo. This seems quite cumbersome.

ObservableCollection Transform Wrapper," When creating ViewModels in WPF it's sometimes necessary to transform data that is available in an ObservableCollection (the source collection) into a collection of wrapper elements that extend/restrict/project the original elements (the target collection), while the number and order of the elements always mirror the original collection.Just like the Select extension method, except that it is continuously updated and can therefore be used for WPF bindings.If an element is added to the source at index x, the Wrapper of the same element is added at the same index x in the target collection. If the element at index y is removed in the source collection, the element at index y is removed in the target collection.Say there is an ObservableCollection<ClassA>, but what I need to bind to is an ReadOnlyObservableCollection<ClassB> (or equivalent), where ClassB -> ClassA as follows: I can write my own TemplatedTransformCollectionWrapper, where I can write this: TemplatedTransformCollectionWrapper ideally wraps all collections that implement INotifyCollectionChanged and correctly handles all possible add, remove, replace operations of the original, wrapped, collection.It's not trivial to write TemplatedTransformCollectionWrapper correctly and it seems to be the kind of thing that someone else has already done, maybe it's even part of the core framework. But I can't find it. <code>  class ClassB : INotifyPropertyChanged, IDisposable{ public ClassB(ClassA a) { Wrapped = a; (Wrapped as INotifyPropertyChanged).PropertyChanged+=WrappedChanged; } public ClassA Wrapped { get; private set; } public int SomeOtherProperty { get { return SomeFunction(Wrapped); } WrappedChanged(object s, NotifyPropertyChangedArgs a) { ... } ...} ObservableCollection<ClassA> source;TemplatedTransformCollectionWrapper theCollectionThatWillBeUsedInABinding = TemplatedTransformCollectionWrapper(source, classA => new ClassB(classA));",ObservableCollection element-wise Transform/Projection Wrapper

How to achive a search for certain year & amount C#," Here is a small demo of a SQL database, where one can add, update delete members from a SQL server. There are two tables in a single SQL Server DB, one is members second is overview. In members there is distinct ID column and members personal info like name, address telephone etc. In overview there are only three columns which are dID, year & amount.There is one single windows form, language is c# and project is built in Visual Studio 2010, and of course data base in SQL Server 2010. The windows form has a reset, insert, update & delete buttons. There is one more button besides the dID text box where a distinct ID can be inserted and after clicking Search button the last entry made about the member shows by filling all the text boxes where name address telephone appear. This serves the function that member full info can be seen and changes can be made or can be removed from dB. There are two text boxes in particular, which are Year & Amount, which shows that the member has paid a certain amount for the certain year. But as I mentioned in the text boxes you can only see the last entry made. What function I want to achieve is that after inserting dID of person x I could only in the year text box able to insert lets say any previous year and the press search which should like normally fill all the text boxes with info, and in the amount text box should show me the entry from the dB that according to the year I entered how much amount is there or there is nothing which means that may be member has not paid for a certain year.

Variable initialazation issue in switch statement," What I have is simple switch statement In this situation compiler tells me that local variable myControl might not be initialized before accessingSo, what is the best way to avoid this situation? One option is to initialize myControl before switch statement. But in this case I do one more unnecessary initalization.CASE 1: Next option is to change second case with default. After that compiler will ""understand"" that myControl will be anyway initialized and will not throw exception.CASE 2: But this case doesn't look so good, because after adding some new properties to my enum it will do default for all other types(developer can easily forget to change code here or it can be not necessary to initialize myControl for other enum types).What is best approach in such situations? <code>  Control myControl;switch(x){ case TabType.Edit: { myControl= ...; } case TabType.View: { myControl= ...; } } myPageView.Controls.Add(myControl); Control myControl = null;switch(x){ case TabType.Edit: { myControl= ...; } case TabType.View: { myControl= ...; } } myPageView.Controls.Add(myControl); Control myControl;switch(x){ case TabType.Edit: { myControl= ...; } default: { myControl= ...; } } myPageView.Controls.Add(myControl);",Variable initialization issue in switch statement
List references in c#, I have a list that gets filled in with some data from an operation and I am storing it in the memory cache. Now I want another list which contains some sub data from the list based on some condition. As can be seen in the below code I am doing some operation on the target list. The problem is that whatever changes I am doing to the target list is also being done to the mainList. I think its because of the reference is same or something.All I need is that operation on the target list not affect data inside the main list. <code>  List<Item> target = mainList;SomeOperationFunction(target); void List<Item> SomeOperationFunction(List<Item> target){ target.removeat(3); return target;},How do I change my new list without changing the original list?
Execute multiple commands in same environment," I'm developing a small C# GUI tool which is supposed to fetch some C++ code and compile it after going through some wizard. This works all nice if I run it from a command prompt after running the famous vcvarsall.bat. Now I would like the user not to go to a command prompt first but have the program call vcvars followed by nmake and other tools I need. For that to work the environment variables set by vcvars should obviously be kept.How can I do that?The best solution I could find yet was to create a temporary cmd/bat script which will call the other tools, but I wonder if there is a better way.Update: I meanwhile experimented with batch files and cmd. When using batch files vcvars will terminate the complete batch execution so my second command (i.e. nmake) won't be executed. My current workaround is like this (shortened): This works, but the output from the cmd call is not captured. Still looking for something better <code>  string command = ""nmake"";string args = """";string vcvars = ""...vcvarsall.bat"";ProcessStartInfo info = new ProcessStartInfo();info.WorkingDirectory = workingdir;info.FileName = ""cmd"";info.Arguments = ""/c \"""" + vcvars + "" x86 && "" + command + "" "" + args + ""\"""";info.CreateNoWindow = true;info.UseShellExecute = false;info.RedirectStandardOutput = true;Process p = Process.Start(info);",Execute multiple commands in same environment from C#
How create a new hard copy (clone) of a List<T>?," In the following piece of code, I use a Book object type to create a List<T> and I populate it with a few items giving them a unique title (from 'one' to 'five').Then I create List<Book> books_2 = new List<Book>(books_1).

Update Window Synchronously," What I am trying to do is to cause a control (in the same process, but which I have no control of) to redraw itself, and for my code to block until it finished redrawing.I tried using UpdateWindow but that doesn't seem to wait for the redraw to finish.The reason I need to wait for it to finish redrawing is that I would like to grab the screen afterwards.The control is not a dotNet control, it's a regular windows control.I've confirmed that:The handle is correct.UpdateWindow returns true.Tried sending InvalidateRect(hWnd, IntPtr.Zero, true) just before the call to UpdateWindow to make sure the window needs invalidating.Tried doing the same thing on the parent window of the control.Code used: <code>  [DllImport(""user32.dll"")][return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]private static extern bool InvalidateRect(IntPtr hWnd, IntPtr rect, bool bErase);[DllImport(""user32.dll"")][return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]private static extern bool UpdateWindow(IntPtr hWnd);public bool PaintWindow(IntPtr hWnd){ InvalidateRect(hWnd, IntPtr.Zero, true); return UpdateWindow(hWnd);}//returns true",Redraw Window Control Synchronously (with blocking method)

System.Drawing - Parameter is not valid. (C#)," After some more testing I've found that this problem may be due to the images somehow not being loaded in time to be cloned into bitmaps and displayed. Is this possible or no?NOTE: Yes, there are other questions with this error in the title, but from a bit of a research it seems to be an ambiguous error with many possible causes. I haven't found any questions with the same scenario as mine.I'm getting the following error. It arises from this code. seemingly at random (i.e., sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The more times it's run in a row without restarting VS and rebuilding the project, the more likely it is to fail): Specifically, the fourth line: The simplified objective of the code is to return a bitmap containing a sprite from a spriteset based on a spriteset index and a sprite index. This bitmap is displayed in a PictureBox until it is changed to a different image. I know for a fact that the logic works; that's not the issue here. The .png I'm using to test is 384*256.All the parameters are set properly, all the referenced files are there, everything seems to be in order. Strangest thing of all is that sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. This has led me to believe that it may be a memory leak within System.Drawing itself but I can't seem to track it down.EDIT: Updated the code and added the StackTrace. Still having the same issue despite disposing the Bitmaps when they are no longer used (see code below for example of how Bitmap is disposed).

Why is my SecurityCriticalAttribute ignored?," I have an assembly marked with the AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute which contains a custom exception class. I want to make it serializable by overriding GetObjectData.With .NET 4, GetObjectDatahas become a SecurityCritical method. This means that overrides also need to be SecurityCritical. Since my assembly is marked with the AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute, all code within is automatically SecurityTransparent unless specified otherwise. Therefore, I apply the SecurityCriticalAttribute to the GetObjectData override: This works fine in full trust scenarios, e.g., when I run code linking this assembly from my desktop.However, when I use this class from a security sandbox (see below), I'm getting a TypeLoadException: Inheritance security rules violated while overriding member: 'Library.MyException.GetObjectData(System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo, System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext)'. Security accessibility of the overriding method must match the security accessibility of the method being overriden.My questions:Why am I getting this exception? I did mark the override to be SecurityCritical, so where's the problem?Since the SecurityCriticalAttribute is ignored in my sandbox, how will this class behave in other partial trust hosts, such as IIS/ASP.NET or SQL Server?How do I implement a serializable exception class in .NET 4?Sandboxing Code: <code>  using System;using System.Runtime.Serialization;using System.Security;[assembly:AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers]namespace Library{ [Serializable] public class MyException : Exception { public string String; public MyException () { } protected MyException (SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) : base(info, context) { String = info.GetString (""String""); } [SecurityCritical] public override void GetObjectData (System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo info, System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext context) { info.AddValue (""String"", String); base.GetObjectData (info, context); } }} var evidence = new Evidence();evidence.AddHostEvidence (new Zone (SecurityZone.Internet));var setupInfo = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetupInformation;var permissionSet = SecurityManager.GetStandardSandbox (evidence);permissionSet.AddPermission (new ReflectionPermission (ReflectionPermissionFlag.MemberAccess));permissionSet.AddPermission (new SecurityPermission (SecurityPermissionFlag.ControlEvidence));var sandbox = AppDomain.CreateDomain (""Sandbox"", evidence, setupInfo, permissionSet);",How do I implement Exception.GetObjectData in .NET 4 in a library assembly that has the AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute?

How can I fix my ListBox templates?," I have a Silverlight application that displays a list of items in a ListBox. Each item represents a different 'page' of my application so I have a style that is applied to the ItemContainerStyle property that looks like this: The style is very simple. It simply displays the Border when the ListBoxItem's visual state is equal to 'Selected'. Notice that the content is hosted by a ContentControl as I want to be able to change the Foreground property when the item is in the 'Selected' state. This works brilliantly as can be seen by the screenshot below:Now I want the selected item to invoke navigation so the idea I had was to create a DataTemplate that sets the content of each item to a HyperLinkButton: Now this doesn't work as the ItemTemplate hosts it's content in a ContentControl rather than a ContentPresenter so I have had to update the ListBoxItem template to use a ContentPresenter instead. I now get the following result:When I click on the HyperLinkButton the ListBoxItem is now no longer selected (I can click just outside the HyperLinkButton and the ListBoxItem becomes selected). What I really want is for the ListBoxItem to become selected when the HyperLinkButton is clicked. The HyperLinkButton has no concept of selection so I cannot bind to the ListBoxItem's IsSelected property.Note: The actual navigation works perfectly, the problem is purely with the appearance of the ListBoxItems.So my questions are:Can I make it so that when the HyperLinkButton is clicked, the ListBoxItem becomes selected like the first image?I will also need some way of changing the foreground of the HyperLinkButton when it is selected as this is no longer done in the items template due to me swapping the ContentControl fro a ContentPresenter.Note: I could probably solve this problem by binding the SelectedItem property of the ListBox to my viewModel and handling the navigation there negating the requirement to have a HyperLinkButton hosted by each ListBoxItem but I am interested in knowing if it is possible using styles and templates to achieve my desired result.UpdateI have tried a couple of things to try and resolve this but so far have been unsuccessful. The first thing I tried was applying a new style to the HyperLinkButton control in my DataTemplate which essentially removes all of the default look and feel from the control but my application still behaves in the way described above.The second thing I tried was setting the IsHitTestVisible property to false. This allows me to click 'through' the HyperLinkbutton and select the ListBoxItem but this means that the navigation is now no longer invoked. <code>  <Style x:Key=""navigationItemContainerStyle"" TargetType=""ListBoxItem""> <Setter Property=""Margin"" Value=""5,3""/> <Setter Property=""FontSize"" Value=""16""/> <Setter Property=""Template""> <Setter.Value> <ControlTemplate> <Grid Cursor=""Hand""> <VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups> <!-- code omitted --!> </VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups> <Border x:Name=""contentBorder"" Background=""{StaticResource navigationHighlightBrush}"" CornerRadius=""3"" Opacity=""0""/> <ContentControl x:Name=""content"" Margin=""10,5"" Content=""{Binding}"" Foreground=""DarkGray""/> </Grid> </ControlTemplate> </Setter.Value> </Setter></Style> <DataTemplate x:Key=""navigationListBoxItemTemplate""> <HyperlinkButton Content=""{Binding}"" Background=""Transparent""/></DataTemplate> <ContentPresenter x:Name=""content"" Margin=""10,5""/>",How to correctly use a button in a listbox itemtemplate / datatemplate?

C#: How to pin an 'unmanaged' pointer?," I have an external method that receives some parameters, allocates memory and returns a pointer. I'm well aware that it is bad practice to allocate unmanaged memory in a managed application but in this case I have no choice as the dll is 3rd party.There is an equivalent function that releases the memory and I do know what is the size of the allocated array.How do I pin the returned pointer so the GC does not move it (without going unsafe)? 'fixed' won't do it as this pointer is widely used throughout the class?Is there a better methodology for this p/Invoke? <code>  [DllImport(""some.dll"", CallingConvention = CvInvoke.CvCallingConvention)]public static extern IntPtr cvCreateHeader( Size size, int a, int b);",How to pin an 'unmanaged' pointer?

EMGU: Access Violation Exception mystery," I've been working with EMGU+OpenCV for quite some time and ran into this AccessViolationException mystery.First thing first, the code: The code is simple. Allocate an array of images. Generate a random image and populate it with random numbers. Execute bilateral filter over the image. That's it.If I execute this program in a single thread, (Threads=1) everything seems to work normally with no problem.But, if I raise the number of concurrent threads to 5 I get an AccessViolationException very quickly.I've went over OpenCV code and verified that there are no allocations on the OpenCV side and also went over the EMGU code searching for un-pinned objects or other problems and everything seems correct.Some notes:If you remove the GC.Collect() you will get the AccessViolationException less often but it will eventually happen.This happens only when executed in Release mode. In Debug mode I didn't experience any exceptions.Although each Image is 675MB there is no problem with allocation (I have ALLOT of memory) and a 'OutOfMemoryException' is thrown in case the system ran out of memory.I used bilateral filter but I get this exception with other filters/functions as well. Any help would be appreciated.

"C# service - ServiceControlHandler used for device notifications, OnStop() not called"," I'd like to write a service that listens for device notifications (USB media plugged in, removed). The problem of listening for device notifications in a C# service is, that System.Windows.Forms.Control.WndProc isn't available because a windows service doesn't have any windows.I found this HowTo on how to write such a service. The author of that article found a workaround which lets the service listen for device notifications instead of service control messages and therefore, the service doesn't support OnStop() anymore.(Update 26.01.13:)Sadly, I don't really understand the service control manager and the windows API. I'm wondering if it is possible to register to both, service control messages AND usb device notifications or if this is really the only option for a service to listen to device notifications. I haven't yet found any (understandable for me) information which solves my problem.Might it be possible to use the System.Windows.Forms.Control.WndProc without generating windows (I'd just have to add the System.Windows.Forms assembly, right?).(Update 27.01.13:)I just found this question: Cannot start desktop application from Windows service on Windows 7The second answer there says, that Windows services received a security-centric makeover in Windows Vista and GUI elements are now created in Session 0 even if the ""Allow service to interact with desktop"" is checked. Does that mean, that I CAN create a Windows Form which then receives the USB device events (and therefore, I don't need to mess with the ServiceControlHandler? Are there any caveats or problems doing this?In short, I need a solution that does one of the following:Make OnStop available again, orprovide another method of listening for usb device notifications in a Windows C# serviceMy source code is currently the following. It is almost identical to the source code offered by the HowTo I linked in the first paragraph.

"ServiceControlHandler used for device notifications, OnStop() not called"," I'd like to write a service that listens for device notifications (USB media plugged in, removed). The problem of listening for device notifications in a C# service is, that System.Windows.Forms.Control.WndProc isn't available because a windows service doesn't have any windows.I found this HowTo on how to write such a service. The author of that article found a workaround which lets the service listen for device notifications instead of service control messages and therefore, the service doesn't support OnStop() anymore.(Update 26.01.13:)Sadly, I don't really understand the service control manager and the windows API. I'm wondering if it is possible to register to both, service control messages AND usb device notifications or if this is really the only option for a service to listen to device notifications. I haven't yet found any (understandable for me) information which solves my problem.Might it be possible to use the System.Windows.Forms.Control.WndProc without generating windows (I'd just have to add the System.Windows.Forms assembly, right?).(Update 27.01.13:)I just found this question: Cannot start desktop application from Windows service on Windows 7The second answer there says, that Windows services received a security-centric makeover in Windows Vista and GUI elements are now created in Session 0 even if the ""Allow service to interact with desktop"" is checked.

C# Net.Mail causing exchange server issues," I've recently designed a program in C# that will pull information from SQL databases, write an HTML page with the results, and auto-email it out. I've got everything working [sporadically], the problem I'm having is that I seem to be crashing our company's exchange server. After the first few successful runs of the program, I'll start getting this exception: Base exception: System.Net.Mail.SmtpException: Insufficient system storage. The server response was: 4.3.1 Insufficient system resourcesI'm wondering if I should be calling some sort of Dispose()-like method in my mailing? Or if there is any other apparent reason that I would be causing the mail system to stop responding? This affects all clients in our company, not just my code.This is Exchange 2010, and my code is compiled against .NET 3.5. My attachments are typically 27kb. If I log into the exchange server, it seems that messages just stick in a queue indefinitely. Clearing out the queue (remove without sending NDR) and rebooting the server will get it going again.The mailing portions look like this (username, password, and address changed): <code>  public void doFinalEmail(){ List<string> distList = new List<string>(); string distListPath = Environment.CurrentDirectory + ""\\DistList.txt""; string aLine; logThat(""Attempting email distribution of the generated report.""); if (File.Exists(distListPath)) { FileInfo distFile = new FileInfo(distListPath); StreamReader distReader = distFile.OpenText(); while (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(aLine = distReader.ReadLine())) { distList.Add(aLine); } } else { logThat(""[[ERROR]]: Distribution List DOES NOT EXIST!

What is the equivilent of MVC's DefaultModelBinder in ASP.net Web API?," I want to create a custom model binder in ASP.Net Web API. There are plenty of resources on how to do this from scratch, but I want to leverage existing functionality.I have looked around in the source on codeplex and can see plenty of modelbinders in there but most are sealed... and even then I can't work out which one would be used in which situations.Here is my api method header: What I want to do is basically intercept the modelbinder after it has populated all the basic properties, and then set some extra values based on http request headers that I'll be setting on the client side.As I say, I am comfortable with creating custom modelbinders and modelbinderproviders and wiring them in, the bit I'm having a problem with is trying to re-use the existing functionality provided.Thanks, Pete <code>  public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Post(long appId, [FromBody]Field field)",What is the equivalent of MVC's DefaultModelBinder in ASP.net Web API?
Is it safe (pun intended) to copy bitmaps using lockbits this way?," I think I've found a MUCH faster way to copy bitmaps in c#. (If it's valid, I'm sure I wasn't the first but I haven't seen it anywhere yet.)The simplest way I can think to ask this is to assert what I based my idea on and if no one shoots holes in it, assume the idea is sound: 1) LockBits simply copies a block of pixel data out of a bitmap to fixed memory to be edited and copied back in using UnlockBits2) Using LockBits does not affect the copied memory block so it should have no effect on the image copied from.3) Since you never enter unsafe code, there should be no risk of corrupting memory.Possible holes I see:1) If the PixelFormats of the two bitmaps are different, this method may not always copy correctly. However, since LockBits requires specifying a pixelformat, it seems this is handled. (If so, hooray for that overhead the other 99.9% of the time we're not switching pixelformats! /EndSarcasm)2) If the stride of the two bitmaps doesn't match, there could be a problem (because stride is the outer for loop's incrementor in the copy operation.) This problem would limit copying to bitmaps with equal stride.Edit: I think assertion #2 must be wrong... I just found an error when trying to later access the bitmap passed through CopyMe. Workaround below, but I'm not sure if it leaves a block of fixed memory lying around. (memory leak alert!) <code>  void FastCopyRegion(Bitmap CopyMe, ref Bitmap IntoMe, Rectangle CopyArea) { //`IntoMe` need not be declared `ref` but it brings // attention to the fact it will be modified Debug.Assert(CopyMe.PixelFormat == IntoMe.PixelFormat, ""PixelFormat mismatch, we could have a problem""); Debug.Assert(CopyMe.Width == IntoMe.Width, //This check does not verify ""Stride mismatch, we could have a problem"");// sign of `stride` match BitmapData copyData = CopyMe.LockBits(CopyArea, ImageLockMode.ReadWrite, CopyMe.PixelFormat); IntoMe.UnlockBits(copyData); } void FastCopyRegion(Bitmap CopyMe, ref Bitmap IntoMe, Rectangle CopyArea) { //`IntoMe` need not be declared `ref` but it brings attention to the fact it will be modified Debug.Assert(CopyMe.PixelFormat == IntoMe.PixelFormat, ""PixelFormat mismatch, we could have a problem""); Debug.Assert(CopyMe.Width == IntoMe.Width, ""Width mismatch, we could have a problem""); BitmapData copyD = IntoMe.LockBits(CopyArea, ImageLockMode.ReadWrite, CopyMe.PixelFormat); BitmapData copyData = CopyMe.LockBits(CopyArea, ImageLockMode.ReadWrite, CopyMe.PixelFormat); CopyMe.UnlockBits(copyData); IntoMe.UnlockBits(copyData); }",Is it safe (pun intended) to copy bitmap regions using lockbits this way?
Web.API and jQuery JSON Post- null value?," I can't seem to get this to work... I have some jQuery like this on the client: And in my Web.API controller I have a method like this: I'm just checking to see if a file lives on the server, and to return a bool as to whether it does or not. The report string I am sending is a UNC path, so reportpath looks like '\\some\path\'.I can fire the script okay, and hit a breakpoint in my ReportExists method, but the report variable is always null.What am I doing wrong?I also see a way to post with .post and postJSON. Maybe I should be using one of those? If so, what would my format be?Update: An additional clue maybe- if I remove [FromBody] then my breakpoint doesnt get hit at all- 'No http resource was found that matches the request'. Examples I am looking at show that [FromBody] isn't needed...? <code>  $.ajax({ type: ""POST"", url: ""api/report/reportexists/"", data: JSON.stringify({ ""report"":reportpath }), success: function(exists) { if (exists) { fileExists = true; } else { fileExists = false; } }}); [HttpPost]public bool ReportExists( [FromBody]string report ){ bool exists = File.Exists(report); return exists;}",jQuery posts null instead of JSON to ASP.NET Web API

what's the difference between DbContext and ObjectContext, From MSDN: Represents a combination of the Unit-Of-Work and Repository patterns and enables you to query a database and group together changes that will then be written back to the store as a unit. DbContext is conceptually similar to ObjectContext.I though DbContext only handle the connection to the DB and the number of threads working against the DB. Now I understand it contains the tracking mechanism? I thought this was in the ObjectContext.So what is (in plain English) the difference between them? <code> ,What's the difference between DbContext and ObjectContext

How to handle exceptions in Tasks with TPL?," I studied this article on MSDN, as well as some questions/answers on SO regarding this topic, but cannot figure why below code does not work (in a sample console app).AggregateException is expected to be thrown, according to MSDN, which would contain one inner exception with hello message. Instead, this hello exception is unhandled. It happens when inside a debugger.If you press continue or run standalone, it works as expected. Is there any way to avoid pressing continue all the time in VS? After all, whatever is within a Try...Catch block is considered handled in a single threaded programming model. Otherwise, debugging could be a nightmare.VB.NET C# Is there something obvious I am missing here? <code>  Sub Main() Try Task.Factory.StartNew(AddressOf TaskThatThrowsException).Wait() Catch ex As AggregateException Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString) 'does not get here until you hit Continue End TryEnd SubPrivate Sub TaskThatThrowsException() Throw New Exception(""hello"") 'exception was unhandledEnd Sub namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { try { Task.Factory.StartNew(TaskThatThrowsException).Wait(); } catch (AggregateException ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString()); //never gets here } } static void TaskThatThrowsException() { throw new Exception(""hello""); //exception was unhandled } }}",How to handle exceptions in Tasks with debugger?

DataSet Update Operation," I have an application which uses DataSet.WriteXML to export data and DataSet.ReadXML to import data. During the import process I need to change certain primary keys as part of the application logic. When there are over 500K records, it writes to XML and read from XML successfully. Once I change the primary key it waits some time and throws an OutOfMemory exception. The reason as I believe is, it has to do a lot of cascade updates. I tried BeginEdit and EndEdit during primary key change, but still failing in EndEdit in that case.As I have understood, DataSets keeps some of previous data also in memory. Is there any way to optimize DataSet update operations in a way it consumes minimum memeory? <code> ",DataSet Cascade and Memory consumption

Url.Content threw NullReferenceException," I have an MVC3 application, which is suddenly giving me some strange behavior. First some background (although I'll try to make this as brief as possible).In my controller action, I have this code: This controller action hides a fair amount of complex logic, because ListViewResult is a custom result ActionResult designed specifically for formatting JSON lists. Now, it seems that occasionally a NullReferenceException's being thrown at the line vm => Url.Content(...) and vm => Url.Action(...). This does not always happen, but if I refresh a few times, I can reliably reproduce it.UpdateAfter digging around in the source code for a while, I believe I've uncovered the offending code. The issue seems to be with the UrlRewriterHelper.WasThisRequestRewritten method which calls ServerVariables.Get(""IIS_WasUrlRewritten""). It seems that method makes use of a private field named _request which is null at this point in the code (for some reason).

Url.Content / Url.Action threw NullReferenceException," I have an MVC3 application, which is suddenly giving me some strange behavior. First some background (although I'll try to make this as brief as possible).In my controller action, I have this code: This controller action hides a fair amount of complex logic, because ListViewResult is a custom result ActionResult designed specifically for formatting JSON lists. Now, it seems that occasionally a NullReferenceException's being thrown at the line vm => Url.Content(...) and vm => Url.Action(...). This does not always happen, but if I refresh a few times, I can reliably reproduce it.UpdateAfter digging around in the source code for a while, I believe I've uncovered the offending code. The issue seems to be with the UrlRewriterHelper.WasThisRequestRewritten method which calls ServerVariables.Get(""IIS_WasUrlRewritten""). It seems that method makes use of a private field named _request which is null at this point in the code (for some reason). My best guess is that some time between the action returning and the result executing, the ServerVariables collection either looses it's internal reference to _request - OR - the ServerVariables collection is being recreated without a valid reference to _request.I've also realized that this may be an issue with IIS Express.

Why do we need static contructor," First of all, I got an answer in What is the use of static constructors?, but I want an answer in this context.Here is my C# static class: Inside this I have a static variable i which is initialized to 10 when it is first called. So basically it may be the purpose of a static constructor but the same thing can be achieved without declaring a static constructor by initializing the static int i = 10 which serves the same purpose that is gets initialized only once.Then why do we need a static constructor? Or am I completely wrong in understanding the concept or use of static constructors? <code>  public static class BasicClass{ static int i = 0; static BasicClass() { i = 10; } public static void Temp() { //some code } public static void Temp1() { //some code }}",Why do we need static constructors?

Here's the scenario, I have a list of data pulled from the database, this little bit is a filter function (so no [HttpPost]) that filters the content based on user input. The first thing it checks is the review list in the review database, if this returns empty I want it to check the user list in the review database.here's the code: I've messed about with it a bit, the if statement used to check if it was null, then .any(), then != null and now both, the variable just walks on by, laughing as it goes. I ran debugger and put it on a few spots. When I input a value that I know will not return results this is what the debugger says the review value is:""IEnumerable did not yield any results"" In a pathetic attempt to prevent this I even chucked that sentence in the if statement. the variable laughed so hard I swear I could hear it through my speakers.Anyways guys, if I could get the best way to do this, and why. There will be cookies. <code>  var review = from m in _db.Reviews select m; if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(searchString)) { review = review.Where(s => s.review.Contains(searchString)); if (review != null && review.Any()) { return View(review); } else { review = review.Where(s => s.user.Contains(searchString)); return View(review); }",mvc 4 IEnumerable checking if its null

Remove Signing from assembly," I have a project open in Visual Studio (it happens to be Enyim.Caching). This assembly wants to be delay-signed. In fact, it desires so strongly to be delay-signed, that I am unable to force Visual studio to compile it without delay signing.I have unchecked ""Delay sign only"" and ""Sign the assembly"" on the Visual Studio project properties box, and rebuilt. The assembly is still marked for delay sign (as shown by sn.exe -v).I have unloaded the project and verified that the signing is set to false. When reloading the project, the check boxes for ""Sign"" and ""Delay Sign"" are checked.I have verified that no attributes are present in the AssemblyInfo (or elsewhere) that would cause this.I have searched the Internet for a solution, but have found none.How can I do this? <code> ",Remove signing from an assembly

Process involved:Create a build for windows servicePush the setup file (.msi) to remote locationCall the .msi and install the service silently without user interaction.What i did so far:Created a powershell script to push files to remote locationExecute powershell script and install the servicePlease keep in mind that powershell script is used for installing service from a project directory not for installing .msi file created using Setup Project these are two vast different things. If you don't understand this don't answer please.Possible solutions:Use (http://www.msbuildextensionpack.com/help/4.0.5.0/html/258a18b7-2cf7-330b-e6fe-8bc45db381b9.htm) msbuild extension pack.Use buildarguments to call msbuild extension pack to install windows service. Use (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x8zx72cd.aspx) Exec TaskUse WIX(Windows Installer Xml)Now my question is. How can i push windows service installer to remote location? And how can create custom build arguments and use either msbuild extension pack or Exec Task and install the service?I know this sounds stupid and irritating question for someone who hasn't installed the service using (.MSI) created by the Setup Project.

Is it possible to have a REST querystring with an ampersand?," Using the System.ServiceModel libraries for routing, I have a REST service with a simple template that looks like ""{searchTerm}?opt={someSearchOpt}So the call would look like: http://myhost.contoso.com/searchapi/river%20expeditionsto search for the phrase ""river expeditions"" with no options.This simply accepts a search phrase and returns results. It works just fine. However, if searching for a phrase that contains a literal ampersand, such as ""Lewis&Clark"", i tried the obvious of url encoding the ampersand Lewis%26Clarkbut even so the request is never even routed, but the server immediately returns a 400 Bad Request. It is clear that it is being interpreted as a query string delimiter, and makes the request invalid since this particular template is expecting a url parameter and has no preceeding '?' delimiter. Since these search phrases may have other restricted characters, they are expected to by url encoded by the client, and when they are successfully routed, the REST api calls HttpUtility.UrlDecode on the parameter. So my question is really if there is some technique to getting a url encoded ampersand correctly routed as a rest url parameter and not pre-emptively interpreted and rejected as a query string delimiter?Update: For the record, if the search term were expected as a query string parameter (not a url parameter), sending Lewis%26Clark works fine. For example http://myhost.contoso.com/searchapi?searchTerm=lewis%26clarkSo to clarify, I am looking to get the same result when using a url parameter in a REST template. <code> ",Is it possible to have a REST url parameter with an ampersand?

Can't find the memory leak in code. Assistance would be great," Ok, I've been trying to do something specific with video feed from a webcam. I have a Lumenera Infinity 2 microscope that I am trying to pull feed from, and want to be able to modify the feed as it comes in. Since I couldn't find a way to do that using Video Source Player, I decided to instead pull each frame (max of 15fps for the camera) as a bitmap so I can do my modifications there.The problem is: I have a HUGE memory leak. When I run the video just using the videoSourcePlayer, it hovers at using around 30 megs. When I run pulling the frames as bitmaps, it breaks 1 gig of memory in a matter of seconds.What am I missing, here? I figured auto-garbage collection would scoop up the old frames as they became inaccessible. Should I try to force garbage collection on bitmap? Or is it something else entirely and I am noobishly missing it. <code>  FilterInfoCollection captureDevices;VideoCaptureDevice cam;Bitmap bitmap;public Form1(){ InitializeComponent();}private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e){ try { captureDevices = new FilterInfoCollection(FilterCategory.VideoInputDevice); if (captureDevices.Count == 0) throw new ApplicationException(); CameraSelectComboBox.Items.Clear(); foreach (FilterInfo device in captureDevices) { CameraSelectComboBox.Items.Add(device.Name); } CameraSelectComboBox.SelectedIndex = 0; CameraSelectComboBox.Enabled = true; } catch (ApplicationException) { CameraSelectComboBox.Enabled = false; }}private void connectButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e){ cam = new VideoCaptureDevice(captureDevices[CameraSelectComboBox.SelectedIndex].MonikerString); cam.NewFrame -= Handle_New_Frame; //Just to avoid the possibility of a second event handler being put on cam.NewFrame += new AForge.Video.NewFrameEventHandler(Handle_New_Frame); videoSourcePlayer1.Visible = false; cam.Start(); //videoPictureBox1.Visible = false; //videoSourcePlayer1.VideoSource = new VideoCaptureDevice(captureDevices[CameraSelectComboBox.SelectedIndex].MonikerString); //videoSourcePlayer1.Start();}private void Handle_New_Frame(object sender, NewFrameEventArgs eventArgs){ bitmap = (Bitmap)eventArgs.Frame.Clone(); videoPictureBox1.Image = bitmap;}",Memory leak in webcam code

"Which pattern is more preferable: test-create, try-create, create-catch?"," Let's assume there is an operation that creates a user. This operation may fail if specified email or username exists. If it has failed, it is required to know exactly why. There are three approaches of doing this as I see it and I'm wondering whether there is a clear winner.So, here's a class user: And there are 3 ways of accomplishing create operation:Test-Create UserExists and UsernameExists make request to db server to do a validation. These calls are again repeated in CreateUser to ensure API is used correctly. In case validation has failed, I throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException in both cases. So there is a performance hit.Try-Create This pattern does the validation only once, but we resort to using the so called error codes which isn't considered a good practice.Create-Catch I don't use error codes here, but I now have to create a separate exception class for every case. It's more or less how exceptions are supposed to be used, but I wonder if creating a separate exception instead of enum entry is worthwhile.So, do we have a clear winner or it's more a matter of taste? <code>  class User{ public string Email { get; set; } public string UserName { get; set; }} if (UserExists(user)) act on user exists error;if (UsernameExists(user)) act on username exists error;CreateUser(user); enum CreateUserResultCode{ Success, UserAlreadyExists, UsernameAlreadyExists}if (!TryCreate(user, out resultCode)){ switch(resultCode) { case UserAlreadyExists: act on user exists error; case UsernameAlreadyExists: act on username exists error; }} try{ CreateUser(user);}catch(UserExistsException){ act on user exists error;}catch(UsernameExistsException){ act on username exists error;}","Which design is most preferable: test-create, try-create, create-catch?"

Here is my current code and the controller <code>  $(document).ready(function () { var uploader = new plupload.Uploader({ runtimes: 'html5', browse_button: 'pickfiles', container: 'container', // max_file_size: '20000mb', url: '@Url.Action(""Upload"", ""Home"")', chunk_size: '4mb', //filters: [ // { title: ""Excel files"", extensions: ""xls,xlsx"" }, // { title: ""Text files"", extensions: ""txt"" } //], multiple_queues: true, multipart: true, multipart_params: { taskId: '' } }); [HttpPost] public ActionResult Upload(int? chunk, string name, string taskId) { string filePath = """"; var fileUpload = Request.Files[0]; var uploadPath = Server.MapPath(""~/App_Data/Uploads""); chunk = chunk ?? 0; string uploadedFilePath = Path.Combine(uploadPath, name); var fileName = Path.GetFileName(uploadedFilePath); try { using (var fs = new FileStream(filePath, chunk == 0 ?

Treat control as either ComboBox or TextBox in C#," What is the best way to solve the following problem? You see it's complicated enough to get the AutoCompleteMode-property. You can assume that it is guaranteed that I have either a ComboBox or a TextBox.My first idea was to use generic with multiple types for T, but it seems that this is not possible in .NET: Sadly the both Controls don't have a common base class.Note: This is meant to be a more general question used with a minimized example. In my case, I also want to access / manipulate other the AutoComplete*-proprties (which also both Controls have in common).Thanks for ideas! <code>  foreach (Control control in this.Controls){ if (control is ComboBox || control is TextBox) { ComboBox controlCombobox = control as ComboBox; TextBox controlTextbox = control as TextBox; AutoCompleteMode value = AutoCompleteMode.None; if (controlCombobox != null) { value = controlCombobox.AutoCompleteMode; } else if (controlTextbox != null) { value = controlTextbox.AutoCompleteMode; } // ... }} public string GetAutoCompleteModeProperty<T>(T control) where T: ComboBox, TextBox // this does not work, of course",Treat control as either ComboBox or TextBox

Deprecation behavior using the [Obsolete] keyword in C#," While removing some obsolete code I came across an unexpected scenario, recreated below: Based in the output it seems that functions deprecated with a warning are permitted to call functions deprecated with an error and the code will execute.

Why recursive constructor calls make invalid C# code compile?," After watching webinar Jon Skeet Inspects ReSharper, I've started to play a little withrecursive constructor calls and found, that the following code is valid C# code (by valid I mean it compiles). As we all probably know, field initialization is moved into constructor by the compiler. So if you have a field like int a = 42;, you will have a = 42 in all constructors. But if you have constructor calling another constructor, you will have initialization code only in called one.For example if you have constructor with parameters calling default constructor, you will have assignment a = 42 only in the default constructor.To illustrate second case, next code: Compiles into: So the main issue, is that my code, given at the start of this question, is compiled into: As you can see, the compiler can't decide where to put field initialization and, as result, doesn't put it anywhere. Also note, there are no base constructor calls. Of course, no objects can be created, and you will always end up with StackOverflowException if you will try to create an instance of Foo.I have two questions:Why does compiler allow recursive constructor calls at all?Why we observe such behavior of the compiler for fields, initialized within such class?Some notes: ReSharper warns you with Possible cyclic constructor calls. Moreover, in Java such constructor calls won't event compile, so the Java compiler is more restrictive in this scenario (Jon mentioned this information at the webinar).This makes these questions more interesting, because with all respect to Java community, the C# compiler is at least more modern.This was compiled using C# 4.0 and C# 5.0 compilers and decompiled using dotPeek. <code>  class Foo{ int a = null; int b = AppDomain.CurrentDomain; int c = ""string to int""; int d = NonExistingMethod(); int e = Invalid<Method>Name<<Indeeed(); Foo() :this(0) { } Foo(int v) :this() { }} class Foo{ int a = 42; Foo() :this(60) { } Foo(int v) { }} internal class Foo{ private int a; private Foo() { this.ctor(60); } private Foo(int v) { this.a = 42; base.ctor(); }} internal class Foo{ private int a; private int b; private int c; private int d; private int e; private Foo() { this.ctor(0); } private Foo(int v) { this.ctor(); }}",Why does a recursive constructor call make invalid C# code compile?
Why won't my $.ajax call return a json object?," I have this jquery that uses ajax in an attempt to return a json object, but I am no pro at ajax, though I have used it before with json, only I was loading a json file and not trying to return a string from a cshtml page that queries a database for information (as I am doing here).Here is the jQuery: (Also I have tried ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"" as the contentType, but it changes no behavior).Here is the cshtml page that I point AJAX to: It is very important to note a couple of things:I get no server-side error or error code.I have written the output to a simple .txt file to test the contents, and by pasting it into jsonLint (found here: http://jsonlint.com/) I was easily able to determine that this is, indeed, valid json syntax.I am still always getting the alert message that runs only under the ""error: function()"" option of the $.ajax call.I am getting no white space either before or after the entire jsonString (not that that probably matters).I am in a WebMatrix, C#, asp.net-webpages environment.My only two suspicions are 1) The dataType and/or contentType is not set correctly, or 2) The last time I had to use ajax for json (targeting an actual .json file) I had to change a setting in ""IIS Express"" to allow it to receive data from json files, however, I thought that this was only needed if actually using ajax to parse a json ""file"" and not just json data. Also, no matter where I look, I can't seem to find this resource anymore.The textStatus and error parameter values are: textStatus: parsererror error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token & but this doesn't seem to throw any red flags in my mind, because I know that the json syntax by itself checks out okay.Thanks to everyone for all of your help.

Challenge from a book I'm reading on C#," I'm doing a challenge from a book and it's asking me to create a loop that counts down from 20 to 0 and has me print a message for each number.

How does Visual Studio know if the source file matches the original version? C#," I figured out how a .NET assembly .dll file maps to a .pdb using a GUID (blog). When I debug into an assembly and it asks for the source code, if I navigate to a file, it may tell me that the source code is different from the original. How does it know this? I was expecting the .pdb file to contain a checksum for each file, but it doesn't appear to. The best tool I found to dump the debug information is dia2dump. The C++ .pdb files had MD5 entries, but the C# .pdb files did not.

Deleting users in CRM Dynamics," I'm fully aware that deleting users (SystemUser Entity) in CRM Dynamics 2011 is not supported by Microsoft.However, we're currently developing a tool to support our User Provisioning needs. In order to be able to write integration tests for this tool, it seems necessary to be able to remove users afterwards, so that we can rollback our test environment to the original state.Currently, we're doing this by restoring organizations from SQL backups, but this is too time consuming to do for each test run.UpdateSo far, the best solution we have is to create a user in the integration test, assert everything we need to assert, and afterwards ""clean it up"" by disabling the user and removing its AD credentials, so that we can re-use those credentials for the next run of the test. However, as we're only looking for a solution for a test environment, I would really like to have a solution that cleans everything up properly: deleting the records in SQL seems like the way to go. Due to the complex DB structure, however, I was hoping that someone could provide scripts for this.Update2We've created the script to manually delete the user from SQL (see accepted answer). This is not supported, so only use it in test environments, if you know what you're doing. <code> ",Deleting users in CRM Dynamics 2011

Design patter for dynamic c# object," I have a queue that processes objects in a while loop. They are added asynchronously somewhere.. like this: And they are processed like this: Now, the thing is that I'd like to modify this to support a TTL-like (time to live) flag, so the file path would be added o more than n times.How could I do this, while keeping the bool process(String path) function signature? I don't want to modify that. I thought about holding a map, or a list that counts how many times the process function returned false for a path and drop the path from the list at the n-th return of false. I wonder how can this be done more dynamically, and preferably I'd like the TTL to automatically decrement itself at each new addition to the process. I hope I am not talking trash. Maybe using something like this <code>  myqueue.pushback(String value); while(true){ String path = queue.pop(); if(process(path)) { Console.WriteLine(""Good!""); } else { queue.pushback(path); }} class JobData{ public string path; public short ttl; public static implicit operator String(JobData jobData) {jobData.ttl--; return jobData.path;}}",Design pattern for dynamic C# object

c# objects modification: a strange behaviour...," I'm developing a WPF C# application and I have a strange behaviour in modification of objects. I try to explain it in general way.Suppose that you have an object of a class described as follows: where B is: I pass an instance of A class and an instance of B class from a window to another, only defining two variables of type A and B in the second window and passing them before the Show() method, with the following code, executed into an instance of window FirstWindow: If I have to repeat this code twice(that is, opening twice the window), in the first execution everything works as expected, infact if I modify values in instanceOfB variable, I see the modification also in instanceOfA variable. But, in the second execution, the modification in instanceOfB does not affect instanceOfA...The modifications are done in newWindow. For example: Imagine that you are in the FirstWindow. Click on a button and SecondWindow opens, passing both variables as described above. In SecondWindow, do some modifications, click on OK and SecondWindow closes, returning control to FirstWindow. If I reclick on the same button, I reopen SecondWindow. If I do modifications now, they do not affect both variables.I try to have a look (in VS2012) at both variables in the console with control expression and I see that, in the first pass of code, both variables changes when code above is executed but, in the second pass of code, only instanceOfB changes...EDIT:Following the code that I use to pass parameters to SecondWindow...types are explaind below Consider that obj is given by a button selection into a datagrid, in which each row represents an IntermediatePosition object. In the datagrid, there is a column button and, clicking by buttons, IntermediatePositionsSettingsWindow is opened with the proper dataEDIT:I've performed the folloqing check: where i is the index of related IntermediatePosition object. At first usage of IntermediatePositionsSettingsWindow the objects result equals, but in second usage they are different Why this thing happens? If it is needed any other clarification, I will edit the questionThanks <code>  public class A{ int one; bool two; List<B> listofBObjects;} public class B{ int three; int four;} SecondWindow newWindow = new SecondWindow();newWindow.instanceOfA = this.instanceOfA; //instanceOfA is of type AnewWindow.instanceOfB = this.instanceOfA.listOfBObjects[0]; //instanceOfB is of type BnewWindow.Show(); this.instanceOfB.three++;this.instanceOfB.four--; IntermediatePosition obj = ((FrameworkElement)sender).DataContext as IntermediatePosition; //IntermediatePosition is Class B IntermediatePositionsSettingsWindow ips = new IntermediatePositionsSettingsWindow(); ips.currentIntermediatePosition = obj;//this is the instanceOfB ips.idxOfIpToModify = obj.index; ips.currentSingleProperty = this.currentPropertyToShow; //this is the instanceOfA object ips.sideIndex = this.sideIndex; ips.ShowDialog(); this.currentPropertyToShow.sides[this.sideIndex].intermediatePositionList[i].GetHashCode() == obj.GetHashCode()",c# objects modification: a strange behaviour
When to cleanup static variables?," When can i cleanup objects stored in static variables in C#?I have a static variable that is lazily initialized: Note: That i've just changed Foo to be a static class. It doesn't change the question in any way if Foo is static or not. But some people are convinced that there is no way that an instance of Sqm could be constructed without first constructing an instance of Foo. Even if i did create a Foo object; even if i created 100 of them, it wouldn't help me solve the problem (of when to ""cleanup"" a static member).Sample usage Now, my Sqm class implements a method that must be called when the object is no longer needed, and needs to clean itself up (save state to filing system, release locks, etc). This method must be called before the garbage collectors runs (i.e. before my object's finalizer is called): When, and where, can i call my Shutdown() method? Note: I don't want the developer who uses the Sqm class to have to worry about calling Shutdown. That's not his job. In other language environments he would not have to. The Lazy<T> class does not seem to call Dispose on the Value it lazily owns. So i cannot hook the IDisposable pattern - and use that as the time to call Shutdown. I need to call Shutdown myself.But when?It's a static variable, it exists once for the life of the application/domain/appdomain/apartment.Yes, the finalizer is the wrong timeSome people do understand, and some people don't, that trying to upload my data during a finalizer is wrong. Why is it wrong? Because values might not be there anymore. You don't control what objects are finalized in what order. It is entirely possible that values was finalized before the containing Sqm.What about dispose?The IDisposable interface, and the Dispose() method is a convention. There is nothing that dictates that if my object implements a Dispose() method that it will ever be called. In fact, i could go ahead and implement it: To the person actually reading the question, you might notice that i didn't actually change anything. The only thing i did was to change the name of a method from Shutdown to Dispose. The Dispose pattern is simply a convention. i still have the problem: when can i call Dispose?Well you should call dispose from your finalizerCalling Dispose from my finalizer is just as incorrect as calling Shutdown from my finalizer (they are identically wrong): Because, again, values might not be there anymore. For completeness, we can return to the full original correct code: i've come full circle. i have an object which i need to ""cleanup"" before the application domain shuts down. Something inside my object needs to be notified when it can call Cleanup.Make the developer call itNo.i'm migrating existing concepts from another language into C#. If a developer happens to use the global singleton instance: then the Sqm class is lazy initialized. In a (native) application, the reference to the object is held. During (native) application shutdown, the variable holding the interface pointer is set to null, and the singleton object's destructor is called, and it can clean itself up.Nobody should ever have to call anything. Not Cleanup, not Shutdown, not Dispose. Shutdown should happen automatically by the infrastructure.What is the C# equivalent of i see myself going away, clean myself up?It's complicated by the fact that if you let the garbage collector collect the object: it's too late. The internal state objects i want to persist are likely already finalized.It would be easy if from ASP.netIf i could guarantee that my class were being used from ASP.net, i could ask the HostingEnvironment to notify before the domain shuts down by registering my object with it: And implement the the Stop method: Except my class doesn't know if i'll be called from ASP.net, or from WinForms, or from WPF, or a console application, or shell extension. Edit: People seem to be confused by what the IDisposable pattern exists for. Removed references to Dispose in order to remove the confusion.Edit 2: People seem to be demanding full, detailed, example code before they will answer the question. Personally i think the question already contains too much example code, as it doesn't serve to help ask the question. And now that i've added sooo much code, the question has been lost. People refuse to answer a question until the question has been justified. Now that it's been justified, nobody will read it.It's like diagnosticsIt's like the System.Diagnostics.Trace class. People call it when they want: and never have to think of it again.And then desperation sets ini was even desperate enough, that i considered hiding my object behind an COM IUnknown interface, which is reference counted And then hopefully i could trick the CLR into decrementing the reference count on my interface. When my reference count becomes zero, i know everything is shutting down.The downside of that is that i cannot make it work. <code>  public class Sqm{ private static Lazy<Sqm> _default = new Lazy<Sqm>(); public static Sqm Default { get { return _default.Value; } }} Foo.Default.TimerStart(""SaveQuestion"");//...snip...Foo.Default.TimerStop(""SaveQuestion""); public class Sqm{ var values = new List<String>(); Boolean shutdown = false; protected void Cleanup(ICollection stuff) { WebRequest http = new HttpWebRequest(); http.Open(""POST"", ""https://stackoverflow.com/SubmitUsageTelemetry""); http.PostBody = stuff; http.Send(); } public void Shutdown() { if (!alreadyShutdown) { Cleanup(values); alreadyShutdown = true; } }} ///WRONG: Don't do this!~Sqm{ Shutdown(_values); //<-- BAD! _values might already have been finalized by the GC!} public class Sqm : IDisposable{ var values = new List<String>(); Boolean alreadyDiposed = false; protected void Cleanup(ICollection stuff) { WebRequest http = new HttpWebRequest(); http.Open(""POST"", ""https://stackoverflow.com/SubmitUsageTelemetry""); http.PostBody = stuff; http.Send(); } public void Dispose() { if (!alreadyDiposed) { Cleanup(values); alreadyDiposed = true; } }} public class Sqm : IDisposable{ var values = new List<String>(); Boolean alreadyDiposed = false; protected void Cleanup(ICollection stuff) { WebRequest http = new HttpWebRequest(); http.Open(""POST"", ""https://stackoverflow.com/SubmitUsageTelemetry""); http.PostBody = stuff; http.Send(); } public void Dispose() { if (!alreadyDiposed) { Cleanup(_values); // <--BUG: _values might already have been finalized by the GC! alreadyDiposed = true; } } ~Sqm { Dispose(); }} public class Sqm : IDisposable{ var values = new List<String>(); Boolean alreadyDiposed = false; protected void Cleanup(ICollection stuff) { WebRequest http = new HttpWebRequest(); http.Open(""POST"", ""https://stackoverflow.com/SubmitUsageTelemetry""); http.PostBody = stuff; http.Send(); } protected void Dispose(Boolean itIsSafeToAlsoAccessManagedResources) { if (!alreadyDiposed) { if (itIsSafeToAlsoAccessManagedResources) Cleanup(values); alreadyDiposed = true; } } public void Dispose() { this.Dispose(true); GC.SuppressFinalize(this); } ~Sqm { Dispose(false); //false ==> it is not safe to access values }} Foo.Sqm.TimerStart(); System.Web.Hosting.HostingEnvironment.RegisterObject(this); public class Sqm : IDisposable, IRegisteredObject{ var values = new List<String>(); Boolean alreadyDiposed = false; protected void Cleanup(ICollection stuff) { WebRequest http = new HttpWebRequest(); http.Open(""POST"", ""https://stackoverflow.com/SubmitUsageTelemetry""); http.PostBody = stuff; http.Send(); } protected void Dispose(Boolean itIsSafeToAlsoAccessManagedResources) { if (!alreadyDiposed) { if (itIsSafeToAlsoAccessManagedResources) Cleanup(values); alreadyDiposed = true; } } public void Dispose() { this.Dispose(true); GC.SuppressFinalize(this); } Sqm { //Register ourself with the ASP.net hosting environment, //so we can be notified with the application is shutting down HostingEnvironment.RegisterObject(this); //asp.net will call Stop() when it's time to cleanup } ~Sqm { Dispose(false); //false ==> it is not safe to access values } // IRegisteredObject protected void Stop(Boolean immediate) { if (immediate) { //i took too long to shut down; the rug is being pulled out from under me. //i had my chance.

Random Word Generator Help C#," So I made a pretty simple word generator program in c# that works relatively well. It generates a word based on the length defined by the user. The algorithm adds a consonant and then a vowel for each consecutive letter in the sequence, which isn't ideal, but works well enough for basic words. My only issue is that I told it to add a ""u"" to the letter sequence if a ""q"" shows up right before it, but no matter what I've done it makes the word at least 1 letter too long.I have marked my problem area with a star in the comment above it. Here is the code: <code>  public void WordFinder(){ string word = null; int cons; int vow; //counter int i = 0; bool isword = false; Random rnd = new Random(); //set a new string array of consonants string[] consonant = new string[]{""b"",""c"",""d"",""f"",""g"",""h"",""j"",""k"",""l"",""m"",""n"",""p"",""q"",""r"",""s"",""t"",""v"",""w"",""x"",""y"",""z""}; //set a new string array of vowels string[] vowel = new string[]{""a"",""e"",""i"",""o"",""u""}; while (isword == false) { word = null; Console.WriteLine(""Pick the length of a word""); int num = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); //set the counter ""i"" to 1 i = 1; if (num%2 == 0) { while (i <= num) { if (num != 1) { // current consonant = random consonant cons = rnd.Next(0, 20); // get the consonant from the string array ""consonant"" and add it to word word = word + consonant[cons]; // add 1 to counter i ++; //* if the consonant is ""q"" if (cons == 12) { // add ""u"" right after it word = word + vowel[4]; // add 1 to counter i++; } } vow = rnd.Next(0, 4); word = word + vowel[vow]; i ++; } } if (num % 2 != 0) { while (i <= num - 1) { //repeat same code as done to even length if (num != 1) { cons = rnd.Next(0, 20); word = word + consonant[cons]; i ++; if (cons == 12) { word = word + vowel[4]; i ++; } } vow = rnd.Next(0, 4); word = word + vowel[vow]; i ++; } // if the length is not equal to 1 if (num != 1) { // add a consonant to the end of the word cons = rnd.Next(0, 20); word = word + consonant[cons]; } //if the length is 1 else if (num == 1) { // pick a vowel vow = rnd.Next(0, 4); word = word + vowel[vow]; } } i = 1; Console.WriteLine(word); Console.WriteLine(""Is this a word?

"In C#, how to satisfy the compiler when only partially implementing an interface with an abstract class?"," I have an interface here named IFish.

Entity Framework Looking for Column that does not exist," I am getting the message ... *Invalid column name 'PartLot_Id'*I suppose that it is referring to the ID field of the PART_LOT in the databse. Clearly this table, and no others (not as clear but trust me) possess a field ""PartLot_Id"" so on the surface this makes sense.When I wrote the corresponding entity for this table I wanted to make it a little more friendly so I changed the case of the tables and fields, and in some cases rename the fields completely (trying to distinguish business concerns from data). I did, however decorate the class and properties with the approriate attributes which is supposed to signal to EF what the actual names are in the DataStore. This has worked on all my entities up until now. It appears that EF is ignoring these attributes and implementing it's convention whichis, as I understand it, to assume that the Key field name is the Entity Name plus ""Id"".Can anyone shed any light why it seems that these attributes are being ignored?UPDATE@kirtsen g- Thanks for your response. I feel like we might be on the right track or somewhere closer than where Iam now anyway. I am updating the OP with some additional informationm that I originally excluded in an attempt to keep the post clean and as uncluttered as possible. The PartLot IS being references by a navigation property on another entity model, but it is also annotated correctly(?) The ""Lot"" property of the StrategicPart model returns a ""PartLot"" entity (I changed the name to simply ""Lot"" as StrategicPart.PartLot seemed redundant), but I did assign the ForeignKeyAttribute to the ""PartLotId"" in an attempt to override any CodeFirst assumptions/conventions (one of my problems with the convention over configuration model).Ya' know, it just occured to me, and I am not sure if this is potentially important or not, but the StrategicPart entity, and thusly the STRATEGIC_PART table in the database, is actually a join for a many-to-many relationship between Products and PartLots.Thanks again!UPDATE@kirsten_g - Thanks for hanging in there with me!! I have added the Product class as requested. UPDATE : SOLUTIONI figured out the problem thanks to kirsten_g. By asking to see the Product class it occured to me that I had not added a reference to the STRATEGIC_PART (StrategicPart) entity in it. When I added it, it did not help but then I remembered ... STRATEGIC_PART's only purpose is to facilitate a many-to-many join. If I had left EF to create the models itself, it would not bother with Nav Properties to the joining entity. So I manually did the same. Ignoring the StrategicPart entity I added Nav Properties from the two entities directly to each other and removed any Nav Property referencing StrategicPart. So the updated Product and PartLot classes look like ... Now my entities reference each other properly and my error has gone away! I have marked Kirsten_g's answer as the answer with the above extension!Thanks for everybody'd help.

"await should throw AggregateException, not just the first Exception"," When awaiting a faulted task (one that has an exception set), await will rethrow the stored exception. If the stored exception is an AggregateException it will rethrow the first and discard the rest.How can we use await and at the same time throw the original AggregateException so that we do not accidentally lose error information?Note, that it is of course possible to think of hacky solutions for this (e.g. try-catch around the await, then call Task.Wait). I really wish to find a clean solution. What is the best-practice here?I thought of using a custom awaiter but the built-in TaskAwaiter contains lots of magic that I'm not sure how to fully reproduce. It calls internal APIs on TPL types.

Example of how to use AutoFixture with NSubstitue," I use NSubstitute a lot. And I love it.I am just looking into AutoFixture. It seems great!I have seen AutoFixture for NSubstitute and seen a few examples in Moq on how to use this feature.But I can't seem to translate it into NSubstitute.I tried this: Using: And I get an object, but none of the properties are populated (kind of the point of AutoFixture).I also tried: That also gave me an object with no populated properties. (Note if I do the above with a PersonEntity class, then the properties are all populated.)I am sure that there is a way to make this work, but I can't seem to find it.So, given my IPersonEntity interface above, does anyone know how to use AutoFixture and NSubstitute to give me a populated IPersonEntity object? <code>  var fixture = new Fixture().Customize(new AutoNSubstituteCustomization()); var addDest = Substitute.For<IPerson>(); public interface IPersonEntity{ int ID { get; set; } string FirstName { get; set;} string LastName { get; set;} DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; } char Gender { get; set; } } var fixture = new Fixture().Customize(new AutoNSubstituteCustomization());var result = fixture.Create<IPersonEntity>();",Example of how to use AutoFixture with NSubstitute
Why is HttpContext.Current null?," I have the following test WebAPI code, I don't use WebAPI in production but I made this because of a discussion I had on this question: WebAPI Async questionAnyways, here's the offending WebAPI method: I had hereto believed that the second exception is expected because when the await completes, it will likely be on a different thread where HttpContext.Current as a thread-static variable will no longer resolve to the appropriate value. Now, based on the synchronization context, it could actually be forced to go back to the same thread after the await but I'm not doing anything fancy in my test. This is just a plain, naive use of await.In comments in another question I was told that HttpContext.Current should resolve after an await. There's even another comment on this question indicating the same. So what's true? Should it resolve? I think no, but I want an authoritative answer on this because async and await is new enough that I can't find anything definitive.TL;DR: Is HttpContext.Current potentially null after an await? <code>  public async Task<string> Get(int id){ var x = HttpContext.Current; if (x == null) { // not thrown throw new ArgumentException(""HttpContext.Current is null""); } await Task.Run(() => { Task.Delay(500); id = 3; }); x = HttpContext.Current; if (x == null) { // thrown throw new ArgumentException(""HttpContext.Current is null""); } return ""value"";}",Why is HttpContext.Current null after await?

wpf how to prevent double thickness borders at overlap?," If you have: and put a border of thickness 1 into each grid, you will get double thickness on the border between the grid rows. Is the only way to deal with this to specify the thickness on each edge of the border or is there some control that will create borders around the grid for each column without having double thickness?Currently attempting it with this: However, I started making changes to the old code so this isn'ta really good example of the double borders. However, I am also getting double borders from this template. as each item ends up with a double thickness border where it touches the next item.edit 2: After reading the comments I realized I probably should not have a border defined on the datatemplate for the control and instead just set the border through the control and change the template on the controltemplate.

Nested indexed Select with ImmutableArray<> behaves differently than with Array<>," I am encountering what seems to be a very weird bug in ImmutableArray<> (with BCL Immutable collections v1.0.12.0, runtime .NET 4.5):I have the following two identical structs exactly in the same source file under the same namespace: The following will throw an exception: If I project elements1 into ToArray() on the first line instead of ToImmutableArray(), everything works fine.The only difference between the two structs is that WeightedComponent is used extensively by the code before, while WeightedComponent2 is never used before (this is why it may not be obvious to reproduce the bug).Iterating on elements1 twice in the same expression seem to be related to the issue, as if I remove it the Select works fine, but there is no such problem with elements2. It really seems to be related to the way the code behind ImmutableArray<> is considering both structs (maybe there is a caching mechanism?)Do you have any idea what could be causing this? <code>  public struct WeightedComponent { public readonly IComponent Component; public readonly decimal Weight; public WeightedComponent(IComponent component, decimal weight) { this.Component = component; this.Weight = weight; }}public struct WeightedComponent2 { public readonly IComponent Component; public readonly decimal Weight; public WeightedComponent2(IComponent component, decimal weight) { this.Component = component; this.Weight = weight; }} var elements1 = new[] { 1, 2, 3 }.Select(wc => new WeightedComponent(null, 0)).ToImmutableArray();var foo = elements1.Select((e1, i1) => elements1.Select((e2, i2) => 0).ToArray()).ToArray();if (foo.Length != 3) throw new Exception(""Error: "" + foo.Length); //Error: 1var elements2 = new[] { 1, 2, 3 }.Select(wc => new WeightedComponent2(null, 0)).ToImmutableArray();var foo2 = elements2.Select((e1, i1) => elements2.Select((e2, i2) => 0).ToArray()).ToArray();if (foo2.Length != 3) throw new Exception(""Error: "" + foo.Length);",ImmutableArray<> behaves differently than Array<> for nested Select with index

RangeFileContentResult not working as expected," I have an application which intended to stream videos back from our local DB. I spent a lot of time yesterday attempting to return the data a either a RangeFileContentResult or RangeFileStreamResult without success.In short, when I return the file as either of these two results I cannot seem to get a video to stream correctly (or play at all).The request from the browser gets sent with the following headers: And the response comes provided gives these headers as an example: In terms of network traffic, I get a series of 206's for partial results, then a 200 at the end (according to fiddler) which seems correct. Chrome's network tab disagrees with this and see's an initial request (always 13 bytes which I assume is a handshake) then a couple more requests which have a status of either cancelled or pending. As far as I understand, this is more or less correct, 206 - cancel, 206 - cancel etc. But the video never plays.If I switch the result from my controller to a FileResult, the video plays and Chrome, IE10 and Firefox and appears to begin playing before the end of the download is completed (which feels a little like it's streaming! although I suspect it's not)But with the range result I get nothing in chrome or IE and the entire video downloads in one drop in firefox.As far as I understood, the RangeFileContentResult should handle responding to the client with a range of bytes to download (which mine doesn't seem to do, it just tells it to get the whole file (illustrated by the response above)). And the client should respond to that, which it doesn't seem to do.Does anyone have any thoughts in this area? Specifically:a) Should RangeFileContentResult be sending a range of bytes back to the client?b) Is there any way I can explicitly control the range of bytes requested from the client side?c) Is there any reason or anything I'm doing wrong here which would cause browsers not to load the video at all, when requesting a RangeFileContentResult?EDIT: Added a diagram to help describe what I'm seeing:EDIT2: Ok, so the plot thickens. Whilst playing around with the RangedFile gubbins we needed to push another system test version out and I left the 'RangeFileContentResult' on my controller action as below: Rather oddly, this now seems to work as expected on our Azure system test environment but still not on my local machine.

Making binding property internal instead of public in ViewModel," I am trying some different things using MVVM. In our ViewModel properties which are bind to View are public. I am taking example of a button binding. Here is a simple sample.View.xaml: ViewModel.cs Here my question is that can we make TestButtonCommand internal instead of public? Internal means it is accessible to current project so their should not be any problem doing that? But when I tried to do that it didn't worked. Adding a breakpoint in getter was not hit. So why we cannot make it internal?Here is the link from msdn.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms743643.aspx The properties you use as binding source properties for a binding must be public properties of your class. Explicitly defined interface properties cannot be accessed for binding purposes, nor can protected, private, internal, or virtual properties that have no base implementation.Why we cannot do this? In case of access internal is same as public if working in the same project. Then why we cannot use internal here? There must be a reason that these should be public, and I am looking for that reason. <code>  <Button Content=""Test Button"" Command=""{Binding TestButtonCommand}"" /> private ICommand _testButtonCommand;public ICommand TestButtonCommand{ get { return _testButtonCommand??

If the type doesn't implement IEquatable<T>, non-generic overload of Equals is called irrespective of whether it is class or struct. <code>  public struct Animal : IEquatable<Animal>{ public string Name { get; set; } public bool Equals(Animal other) //<- he is the man { return Name == other.Name; } public override bool Equals(object obj) { return Equals((Animal)obj); } public override int GetHashCode() { return Name == null ? 0 : Name.GetHashCode(); }}var animals = new[] { new Animal { Name = ""Fred"" } };animals.Contains(new Animal { Name = ""Fred"" }); // calls Equals(Animal) public class Animal : IEquatable<Animal>{ public string Name { get; set; } public bool Equals(Animal other) { return Name == other.Name; } public override bool Equals(object obj) //<- he is the man { return Equals((Animal)obj); } public override int GetHashCode() { return Name == null ? 0 : Name.GetHashCode(); }}var animals = new[] { new Animal { Name = ""Fred"" } };animals.Contains(new Animal { Name = ""Fred"" }); // calls Equals(object)",T[].Contains for struct and class behaving differently

Simple Injector:Factory classes that need to create classes with dependencies," I have a factory class that creates a couple of different types of class. The factory is registered with the container. What is the recommended way of creating the classes inside the factory, given that they also have dependencies. I clearly want to avoid a dependency on the container but if I new those classes then they won't be using the container.e.g. So the question is where do I get those dependencies from.One option could be to make them dependencies of the factory.e.g. Another could be to register the worker types and make those dependencies of the factorye.g. With the first option I feel like I am leeching the dependencies of the workers into the factory. With the second option the workers are created when the factory is created. <code>  public class MyFactory{ public IMyWorker CreateInstance(WorkerType workerType) { if (workerType == WorkerType.A) return new WorkerA(dependency1, dependency2); return new WorkerB(dependency1); }} public class MyFactory{ private Dependency1 dependency1; private Dependency2 dependency2; public MyFactory(Dependency1 dependency1, Dependency2, dependency2) { this.dependency1 = dependency1; this.dependency2 = dependency2; } public IMyWorker CreateInstance(WorkerType workerType) { if (workerType == WorkerType.A) return new WorkerA(dependency1, dependency2); return new WorkerB(dependency1); }} public class MyFactory{ private IWorkerA workerA; private IWorkerB workerB; public MyFactory(IWorkerA workerA, IWorkerB, workerB) { this.workerA = workerA; this.workerB = workerB; } public IMyWorker CreateInstance(WorkerType workerType) { if (workerType == WorkerType.A) return workerA; return workerB; }}",Simple Injector: Factory classes that need to create classes with dependencies

Relation between DLLs and Namespaces in C# / C++," High-level question here:I have spent a lot of time today educating myself on basic high-level concepts such as APIs, static and dynamic libraries, DLLs and marshaling in C#. Gaining all of this knowledge led me to what seems like a pretty basic question, and probably demonstrates a hole in my understanding of these concepts:What I know:DLLs may contain classes which in turn contains various class-members such as methods and fields, several of which I might want to utilize in my programIn C# we use the keyword ""using"" at the top of the code, to define a namespace wewant to include in our programWhat I do not get:I was under the impression that the actual methods were defined in the DLLs. How does my program find the actual functions that are defined in the DLLs, when all i give them is a namespace? It seems more intuitive to me to have ""using XYZ.dll"" at top, rather than ""using XYZ_namespace"".Thanks a lot for helping me fill in the gaps here.EDIT: Modified post to be specific to C#.EDIT 2: For other people that wonder how their C# application actually gets a hold of the types made available through ""using namespaceX"", this is a good resource (in addition to the helpful posts below): http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/07/understanding-c-namespaces-and.html.Basically the type you would like to use resides in libraries and you have to set Visual Studio to reference these libraries in order to make it possible to ""use"" its namespace in your code. <code> ",Relation between DLLs and Namespaces in C#

"Empty Interface vs Attrtibute, what about generic constraints?"," I have a class, which uses an empty interface as a ""marker interface"", like this: I read in some other posts, but also on MSDN (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182128.aspx) that this should be avoided, and you should use custom attributes instead of this empty interface. So, I could refactor my code like this: Everything works fine, but the main question is:When I have a generic method elsewhere in my program, for instance: In the above function, I do need to add some generic type constraints on T, so only IMessages are allowed. How could I accomplish this when using a custom attribute instead of an empty interface?And does this justify the use of an empty interface? Or should I use an empty abstract class Message (instead of interface IMessage, since MyMessage is actually a Message).Very curious about what you think about this. <code>  namespace MyNameSpace{ public interface IMessage { //nothing in common here... } public class MyMessage : IMessage { public void SendMyMessage() { //Do something here } }} namespace MyNameSpace{ public class MessageAttribute : Attribute { //nothing in common here... } [MessageAttribute] public class MyMessage { public void SendMyMessage() { //Do something here } }} public IEnumerable<T> GetAll<T>() where T : IMessage{ //Return all IMessage things here}","Empty Interface vs Attribute, what about generic constraints?"

"WaitHandle blocks the owner Thread of my CollectionView, kind of deadlock"," I've written a WPF WizardFramework which performs some actions in the background using some BackgroundWorker. While processing it can happen that I have to update an ObservableCollection which is bound to my UI. For this case I've written a ThreadableObservableCollection, which provides threadsafe methods for Insert, Remove and RemoveAt. Though I'm using .NET 4.5 I was not able to get BindingOperations.EnableCollectionSynchronization working without many other invalid access exceptions. My Collection looks like: This is working as expected, while I am using the wizard in my application. Now I'm using NUnit to write some integrationtests for the application. There's a listener which waits for the WizardViewModel to finish it's work and looking for some pages which are injected in the Steps-Collection. After the asyncrone work is done I can use Validate to check the viewmodel state. Unfortunately I'm using a ManualResetEvent to wait for the wizard to close. This looks like following: Now there's a problem:While the Application is running the UI Thread is not blocked, the Collection can be updated without any problems. But in my testcases the ""main"" Thread where I initialize the ViewModel (and because of that the Collections) is an AppDomainThread which is blocked by the testcode. Now my ThreadsafeInsert wants to update the collection but cannot use the AppDomain Thread. But I have to wait for the wizard to finish, how can I solve this kind of deadlock? Or is there a more elegant solution for this one?edit:I worked around this problem with a check if there's a user interface, and only then I invoke on the Application-Thread, otherwise I change the collection intentionally on another thread. This does not prevent the exception, but it is not recognized from the test... the items are inserted nevertheless, only the NotifyCollectionChanged-Handler is not called (which is only used in the UI anyway). This is an ugly workaround and I am still interested in a clean solution. Is there a way to use an alternate Dispatcher to create (e.g.) the whole ViewModel and use this to change my collection? <code>  public class ThreadableObservableCollection<T> : ObservableCollection<T> { private readonly Dispatcher _dispatcher; public ThreadableObservableCollection() { _dispatcher = Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher; } public void ThreadsafeInsert(int pos, T item, Action callback) { if (_dispatcher.CheckAccess()) { Insert(pos, item); callback(); } else { _dispatcher.Invoke(() => { Insert(pos, item); callback(); }); } } [..] } public class WizardValidator : IValidator, IDisposable { private WizardViewModel _dialog; private readonly ManualResetEvent _dialogClosed = new ManualResetEvent(false); [..] public void ListenTo(WizardViewModel dialog) { _dialog = dialog; dialog.RequestClose += (sender, args) => _dialogClosed.Set(); dialog.StepsDefaultView.CurrentChanged += StepsDefaultViewOnCurrentChanged; _dialogClosed.WaitOne(); } [..] } if (Application.Current != null) { Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() => { Steps.Insert(pos, step); stepsView.MoveCurrentTo(step); }); } else { new Action(() => Steps.Insert(pos, step)).BeginInvoke(ar => stepsView.MoveCurrentToPosition(pos), null); }",ManualResetEvent WaitOne blocks the owner Thread of my CollectionView

Missing first pixel column after a Graphics Transform Scale," I have noticed that the half of the first pixel column of the image is not drawn after a Graphics Transform Scale on the OnPaint event.All the code needed to reproduce it is at the end of the post. Basically I've created a Class derived from PictureBox called PictureBox2 and it overrides the OnPaint method to perform the Scale transformation. It also changes the InterpolationMode to NearestNeighbor to prevent Graphics from changing the pixels look.The PictureBox control was added to a Form called Form6_GraphicsTest. The control is anchored in all sides.

Specifying property values when instantiating immutable objects with AutoFixture," My test requires that I set the Response property on an immutable Rsvp object (see below) to a specific value. I initially tried to do this using Build<Rsvp>().With(x => x.Rsvp, ""Attending""), but realized this only supports writable properties.I replaced that with Build<Rsvp>().FromFactory(new Rsvp(""Attending"")). This works, but is cumbersome for more complex objects where it doesn't matter what some of the properties are. For instance, if the Rsvp object had a CreatedDate property, this method of instantiating the object would force me to write Build<Rsvp>().FromFactory(new Rsvp(""Attending"", fixture.Create<DateTime>())). Is there a way to only specify values for meaning properties for an immutable object? <code>  public class Rsvp{ public string Response { get; private set; } public Rsvp(string response) { Response = response; }}",Specifying [readonly] property values [via ctor args] when instantiating [immutable] objects with AutoFixture

Also, in the local property of the type of each entity in the dbContext I have all the entities of each type.However, if i do the same with a N:N relationship, I don't have the entity of the middle table of the relation, and when I execute the queries I have in the local of the dbContext the entities of each type, but the property navigation is not populated.I would like to know why and if it exists some alternative.I use this way because I want to use T-SQL for create dynamic queries. If I use eager loading I don't have the same flexibility to dynamic queries than when I use TSQL, and it is less efficient. If I use explicit loading I to do N additional queries, one of each record in the results of the main entity With my way, I only one additional query, because I get all the related entities at once.

How to use CultureInfo to format depricated currencies?," In dotnet, the recommended way of formatting currencies in a culture-specific way, is (as far as I can find): This returns: However. No specific currency is given here. So if Great Britain ever converts to Euro, the same method would suddenly return something like: This has just happened to Latvia. This year, it converted to the euro. Various systems contain both amounts in letvian lats and euros. I need to be able to still print and format old currencies. And I need to be sure new currencies can also be handled. This formatting is not just about the symbol, but also about the placement (before, after, with or without space) and the local number format (decimal separator and thousands separator).Every amount in our database has a currency (e.g. EUR) and a corresponding culture (e.g. nl-NL). Euro amounts are formatting differently depending on if they originate from our German or our Dutch office. (they both use euros, but format the amounts differently)Does dotnet provide access to older currencies?What is a future-proof way of writing the formatting amounts?Right now, the only way I can think of, is to copy the culture-database to my database. <code>  using System.Globalizationvar info = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(""en-GB"")return string.Format(info, ""{0:c}"", 1234.5678) 1,234.57 1,234.57",How to use CultureInfo to format deprecated currencies?
"Equivalent of `ContinueWith(delegate, CancellationToken)` with `await` continuation"," I have that situation: In particular, the behavior that interests me here is detailed in MSDN's page about Continuation Tasks in the following terms: A continuation goes into the Canceled state in these scenarios: [...] When the continuation was passed a System.Threading.CancellationToken as an argument and the IsCancellationRequested property of the token is true before the continuation runs. In such a case, the continuation does not start and it transitions to the Canceled state. The code above works.

The exact same code will give the expected 204 if I duplicate it in a Windows forms application. If i point the Windows Forms app to client code contained in a PCL it gives me the 404 Again.Update2:This resolves the issue (though it bothers me no end that I should need to do it): This reintroduces the 404 (fiddler still says 204 and non-silverlight client runs fine) Update 3 (resolved):Finally figured this out.

Should I implement IEquatable or IComparable?," I have a class. The thing that this class is meant to represent is such that we may speak about such things being equal to each other, and we may also come up with a scheme to rank them for purposes of comparison.However, it so happens that it is rare that one feels the need to rank these things, but one often needs to check if two such things are equal.So, I can implement both IEquatable for my class as well as IComparable. While IComparable provides some extra functionality, it is very unlikely that anyone will care about this extra functionality. Neither one seemingly provides a clear advantage, either logically or functionality-wise.Which interface should I implement, IEquatable, IComparable, or both? Why? (I am specifically wondering about framework-wide implications either interface)This question is similar, but the answers only state the obvious, which doesn't help me.In case you are wondering, the class is meant to represent a nucleotide. Nucleotides can readily be equated, but they can also be compared (eg. alphabetically). <code> ","Should I implement IEquatable, or IComparable?"

C# implicitly updates parameter passed to method with no return type and no out or ref usage," This is so funky to me, obviously the developer should have used the keyword out but I can't believe this is even working: My coworker said this is called ""deep reference"", I can't believe this works in C#.

Seems the sentiment is, that as a C# developer I should immediately know, since the argument passed into processResult is a reference type on the heap being passed in by value that a copy of the reference itself is made and that copied reference still points to the same object. <code>  public BusinessResponse<MyResultType> MyMethod(){ BusinessResponse<MyResultType> res = new BusinessResponse<MyResultType>(); ProcessResult(res); return res; //this has the values set by ProcessResult!!!

Moq and DbFunctions," I'm currently attempting to run some unit tests on a query that is running through the Entity Framework. The query itself runs without any issues on the live version, but the unit tests are always failing.I've narrowed this down to my usage of DbFunctions.TruncateTime, but I don't know of a way around this to get the unit tests to reflect what is happening on the live server.Here is the method that I am using: If I comment out the lines with DbFunctions in, the tests all pass (except for the ones that are checking that only valid results for a given date are run).Is there a way I can provide a mocked version of DbFunctions.TruncateTime to use in these tests?

Doing a postback without AutoPostBack," I've got a WebForm with two drop down lists, where the contents of the second one depend on the first.So if the user changes the category, the second dropdown needs to be filled with the list of subcategories.This sounds like a typical job for AutoPostBack.However, there's a bit of a problem with AutoPostBack: if the list isn't dropped open, and the user uses the keyboard to make the choice, the postback happens right after the first keystroke. This prevents the user from scrolling down the list with the down arrow, or typing the name of the category.This happens in Chrome and IE and Opera, but not in Firefox. Firefox fires the onchange event only when leaving the control (tabbing to the next control), just like it would when the list was dropped open, and that's what I want the other browsers to do too.Any solutions how I can achieve this?I tried to remove the AutoPostBack attribute and use onblur, but apparently the page works differently with AutoPostBack than without, because the browsers start complaining about Javascript errors.Now since we're all so fond of jsFiddle, here's one. It doesn't actually do anything, but it can demonstrate the problem. Click on the first dropdown, then click again to close the list. (This is what happens when you navigate through the form with the tab key: dropdown lists don't open up.) Now type a letter or the down arrow. Firefox changes the current selection and waits for you to do anything else, but Chrome and IE and Opera all attempt to submit the form immediately, with drastic results.So how can I avoid that?

How can one achieve the effect of overriding a base member with more specific type in C#?," I'm trying to figure out a way for a derived class to be made up of members that have more specific types than those specified in the abstract base class. Here is some code that works which does what I want, but does not follow the stipulations I mention. As a result, the client code (in Main) must use a cast on the ""BarProperty"" which is what I'm trying to avoid, I guess. What I'd like instead would be to do something like the code below, which of course doesn't compile because ConcreteFoo is trying to override BarProperty using a more specific type than AbstractFoo declared. You may be thinking ""rethink your design"" but it's tricky because I'm trying to incorporate some third party code (without changing that code) which doesn't contain some much needed abstract/interface classes to give interchangeable facades to two very similar halves of the code base. As a result, I've basically had to write my entire program twice, with only minor changes in what types are being used. I need some way to handle either of two very similar types which unfortunately don't have an interface to demonstrate their similarity to the compiler. <code>  using System;using System.Collections.Generic;using System.Linq;using System.Text;namespace Stackoverflow{ class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { ConcreteFoo myFoo = new ConcreteFoo(); myFoo.BarProperty = new ConcreteBar(); ((ConcreteBar)myFoo.BarProperty).ConcreteBarPrint(); Console.ReadKey(); } } abstract class AbstractFoo { protected void FooMethod() { Console.WriteLine(""The Foo method!""); } public abstract AbstractBar BarProperty { get; set; } } class ConcreteFoo : AbstractFoo { private ConcreteBar _concreteBar; public override AbstractBar BarProperty { get { return _concreteBar; } set { _concreteBar = (ConcreteBar)value; } } } abstract class AbstractBar { protected void BarMethod() { Console.WriteLine(""The Bar method!""); } } class ConcreteBar : AbstractBar { public List<int> concreteBarIntList; public ConcreteBar() { concreteBarIntList = new List<int>(); concreteBarIntList.Add(1); concreteBarIntList.Add(2); concreteBarIntList.Add(3); } public void ConcreteBarPrint() { foreach (int item in concreteBarIntList) { Console.WriteLine(item); } } }} using System;using System.Collections.Generic;using System.Linq;using System.Text;namespace Stackoverflow{ class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { ConcreteFoo myFoo = new ConcreteFoo(); myFoo.BarProperty = new ConcreteBar(); myFoo.BarProperty.ConcreteBarPrint(); Console.ReadKey(); } } abstract class AbstractFoo { protected void FooMethod() { Console.WriteLine(""The Foo method!""); } public abstract AbstractBar BarProperty { get; set; } } class ConcreteFoo : AbstractFoo { private ConcreteBar _concreteBar; public override ConcreteBar BarProperty { get { return _concreteBar; } set { _concreteBar = (ConcreteBar)value; } } } abstract class AbstractBar { protected void BarMethod() { Console.WriteLine(""The Bar method!""); } } class ConcreteBar : AbstractBar { public List<int> concreteBarIntList; public ConcreteBar() { concreteBarIntList = new List<int>(); concreteBarIntList.Add(1); concreteBarIntList.Add(2); concreteBarIntList.Add(3); } public void ConcreteBarPrint() { foreach (int item in concreteBarIntList) { Console.WriteLine(item); } } }}",How can one achieve the effect of overriding a base member with more specific type?

Generic method where T inherits from Interface<T>," I'm trying to create a generic data retrieval process. What I have currently works, but there is a part of it that doesn't seem right and I'm hoping there is a better way to accomplish it.So the idea is that I have classes for each table in the database, here is an example of a class: You'll notice that the class implements an interface of its own type. The interface simply defines a method called ToObject, which is used to convert a datatable to a class of that particular type: Now, here is the method that I am using to execute a query: So the main question is:How can the generic method know that T should implement IFacetsObject<T>? That way I don't have to pass IFacetsObject<T> as a parameter.

Now i want to create a Navigation property from my EF6.1 Code first approach in my View to MyTable2.

Also with the approaches in codes that i tried, i always get an error that the migration can't be completed. Because the Migration tries to add an foreign key to the view, which isn't possible.EDIT2: To elaborate a bit more on my explanation. I want to be able to approach it in code the following way: EDIT3:I will eleborate a bit more, to see if i can get my problem better explained. When i added the following to my view Entity: EF will automaticly generate the following migration: Which on running update-database gives the following error :""Cannot create index on view 'MyView1' because the view is not schema bound""EDIT4: With help of the comment that the migration aren't of stone.. and are changeable i made it. I used the following fluentAPI: And changing my tables to this: (The FK to the MyTable2 and removed from the view)MyTable1+idMyTable2+id+myTable1MyView1+idWhich in the end is better because this way i have less Null values in my model. <code>  Guid table2Id = context.MyView1.FirstOrDefault().MyTable2.id; public virtual MyTable2 Table2 { get; set;} public override void Up() { CreateIndex(""MyView1"", ""MyTable2Id""); AddForeignKey(""MyView1"", ""MyTable2Id"", ""MyTable2"", ""id"")} // Map one-to-zero or one relationship modelBuilder.Entity<MyTable2>() .HasRequired(t => t.MyTable1) .WithOptional(t => t.MyTable2); modelBuilder.Entity<MyTable1>() .HasOptional(t => t.MyTable2);",How can you add a navigation property on a view in EF 6.1 CodeFirst
"Why doesn't Stack, Queue and List halve the internal array after removing an item?"," In .NET, Stack, Queue and List (as well as their generic implementations) use an array internally to hold the items.When adding new element, the size of the internal array doubles on Push(), Enqueue() or Add() if it is full.The question is, why doesn't these data structures halve an internal array when item is being removed? It would be a good idea to halve the size of the array on Pop(), Dequeue() or Remove() if it is less than one-quarter full to prevent the waste of memory.I used the following code to check this behavior: <code>  var s = new Stack<int>();for (int i = 0; i <= 512; i++) s.Push(i); // Increases the array capacity to 1024.for (int i = 0; i <= 512; i++) s.Pop(); // Doesn't decrease array capacity.// Stack is empty, but internal array capacity is still 1024:var fieldInfo = typeof(Stack<int>).GetField(""_array"", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);Console.WriteLine((fieldInfo.GetValue(s) as int[]).Length);","Why doesn't Stack, Queue and List shrink the internal array after removing an item?"

Asyncronous Streaming in WCF," I am working with Streaming with WCF and I have a question about what the paragraph on ""Enabling Asynchronous Streaming"" means from the MSDN article on Large Data and Streaming in WCF. To enable asynchronous streaming, add the DispatcherSynchronizationBehavior endpoint behavior to the service host and set its AsynchronousSendEnabled property to true. We have also added the capability of true asynchronous streaming on the send side. This improves scalability of the service in scenarios where it is streaming messages to multiple clients some of which are slow in reading possibly due to network congestion or are not reading at all. In these scenarios we now do not block individual threads on the service per client. This ensures that the service is able to process many more clients thereby improving the scalability of the service.I understand that the above means I add To my web.config file and referencing the AsyncStreaming behavior in my endpoint, however I don't understand what doing those steps accomplishes for me. Do I need to modify my code at all to take advantage of this asynchronousness?Also on a similar topic (but if it is too different I will move it to a new question), how does using async/await effect using Streams in WCF? Can I do Task<Stream> Foo() in my service contract? I make some database calls whose results I eventually wrap in to a custom stream that I will be returning from the WCF service. Being able to use things like ExecuteDataReaderAsync() is very useful, can I still use it when dealing with streamed instead of buffered messages? I have tested it and I know it ""works"" using Tasks but I don't know if doing it causes the function to fall back to ""Buffered"" mode like when you provide more than one parameter to the function (See the 3rd paragraph of ""Programming Model for Streamed Transfers"" on the same MSDN page) and I don't know how to check to see if that is happening. <code>  <behaviors> <endpointBehaviors> <behavior name=""AsyncStreaming""> <dispatcherSynchronization asynchronousSendEnabled=""true"" /> </behavior> </endpointBehaviors> ...",Asynchronous Streaming in WCF

How to use new ASP.NET Identiy 2.0 Roles and Authorize Attribute?," I am using the new ASP.NET Identity 2.0 system. I know I can check if a user is in a role like this: I guess this code can be written to check before certain code is run but what about the [Authorize] attribute. I used to be able say: This doesn't work anymore because I am not using the old membership or Role Management anymore. How can I put the two together? Or how do I guard against certain parts of the application not being available to members of the right role?Edit1: I don't believe that it's working. I put the following Authorize attribute on an Admin page and I am able to execute the code as a ""Customer Account User"" Also, I would like to block that page from being seen by unauthorized users. We have code to block the menu but I can still type the URL to the Admin page and it can be seen by unauthorized users EDIT2: We created the roles manually in the ASpNetRoles table and mapped users to roles in the ASPNetUsersToRoles table. There is a mapping from users to roles like ""Customer Service Admin."" We add users to roles with the following but I don't believe it works: When a regular user logs in they don't get an Admin menu to the Admin page by typing into the address bar: How do I stop that?Edit3: I tried to block all users to the Admin page per your example Eric but once again, I can log in as a Customer User and still type the above in the address bar and get to the page.

TFS Build Issues With Multiple Versions of the Same Assembly in different Projects," I keep running into an issue with our TFS build server. I've got 2 projects (both in the same solution), 1 is a WebForms project, running .Net 4.0. The second is an ASP .Net MVC5 project running .Net 4.5. There is also a Silverlight project, but the problem is reproducible with just the first two.Both of these projects use NuGet packages for various libraries. Sometimes there are different assemblies within a package for their respective environments. A .Net 4.0, 4.5, SL assembly, etc.The build server seems to dump all of the libraries required into a single folder, then pulls from that to build the solution. This causes problems in many cases, with the wrong project getting the wrong assembly version. This does not occur locally, only on the build server. I can't figure out what I need to do to keep this from happening. Any ideas? <code> ",TFS Build Issues With Multiple Versions of the Same Assembly in Different Projects

C# priorities of multiple constraints on a generic type parameter," In the following example, I have two constraints, Foobar and IFoobar<T>, on type T in generic class FoobarList<T>. But the compiler gives an error: Cannot implicitly convert type 'Foobar' to 'T'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?) It seems the compiler considers CreateFoobar as a method in Foobar, but not the one in IFoobar. I can fix the compile by dividing Foobar into a base class FoobarBase, and implementing the interface IFoobar in its derived class, as follows: It is cumbersome to divide Foobar into two classes. Is there a better way to fix this? <code>  interface IFoobar<T>{ T CreateFoobar();}class Foobar : IFoobar<Foobar>{ //some foobar stuffs public Foobar CreateFoobar() { return new Foobar(); }}class FoobarList<T> where T : Foobar, IFoobar<T>{ void Test(T rFoobar) { T foobar = rFoobar.CreateFoobar(); //error: cannot convert Foobar to T }} interface IFoobar<T>{ T CreateFoobar();}abstract class FoobarBase{ //some foobar stuffs}class Foobar : FoobarBase, IFoobar<Foobar>{ public Foobar CreateFoobar() { return new Foobar(); }}class FoobarList<T> where T : FoobarBase, IFoobar<T>{ void Test(T rFoobar) { T foobar = rFoobar.CreateFoobar(); }}",Priorities of multiple constraints on a generic type parameter

I broke up my program into several steps:convert file to binaryconvert 1 to a certain tone and 0 to anotherplay the tones to another computerother computer listens to tonesother computer converts tones into binaryother computer converts binary into file.However, I can't seem to find a way to convert a file to binary. I found a way to convert a string to binary using From http://www.fluxbytes.com/csharp/convert-string-to-binary-and-binary-to-string-in-c/ .But I can't find out how to convert a file to binary (the file could be of any extension).So, how can I convert a file to binary? Is there a better way for me to write my program? <code>  public static string StringToBinary(string data){ StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); foreach (char c in data.ToCharArray()) { sb.Append(Convert.ToString(c, 2).PadLeft(8,'0')); } return sb.ToString();}",Convert file to binary in C#

C# web service - insufficient winsock resources," We have a c# web service and client, both created in Visual Studio 2008 (new project -> ASP.Net web service application). Service is hosted on Windows server 2012 R2, IIS 8.5.When the client sends the data to our service, we forward it to a 3rd party service, save the result to a database and return it to the client.The problem is that, in some rare occasions, when our service is under heavy load (many requests per second), it starts throwing 'Insufficient winsock resources available to complete socket connection initiation'. We found that our web service is opening many TCP connections to 3rd party services, and leaving them in TIME_WAIT state. When the number of such connections reaches a high number (around 17000), the entire server loses ability to make any new connections. Everything from remote desktop to the internet browser stops working. This lasts for a few minutes, and then, when Windows begins closing those connections, it resumes normally.For communication with the 3rd party service, our service is using only one SoapClient instance through its entire life time. It is created on initialization, and is never closed or destroyed; new instances are never created. When sending the data to the 3rd party service we simply call its web method, and leave it like that without closing, disposing or doing any clean-up: Is there anything we can do to avoid this build-up of time_wait connections?Is there a better way to manage SoapClient(s)? Should we open a new soap client for every request and close them manually?If it is relevant, here is how our binding is set up: Thank you! <code>  BLIND.BLINDSoapClient client = new BLIND.BLINDSoapClient(base.binding, base.address); BLIND.Answer answer = client.Search(...);..save to databasereturn answer; binding = new BasicHttpBinding(); binding.Name = ""SLTDSoap""; binding.CloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Timeout); binding.OpenTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Timeout); binding.ReceiveTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Timeout); binding.SendTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Timeout); binding.AllowCookies = false; binding.BypassProxyOnLocal = false; binding.HostNameComparisonMode = HostNameComparisonMode.StrongWildcard; binding.MaxBufferSize = 65536; binding.MaxBufferPoolSize = 524288; binding.MessageEncoding = WSMessageEncoding.Text; binding.TextEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8; binding.TransferMode = TransferMode.Buffered; binding.UseDefaultWebProxy = true; binding.ReaderQuotas.MaxDepth = 32; binding.ReaderQuotas.MaxStringContentLength = 8192; binding.ReaderQuotas.MaxArrayLength = 16384; binding.ReaderQuotas.MaxBytesPerRead = 4096; binding.ReaderQuotas.MaxNameTableCharCount = 16384; binding.Security.Mode = (_url.StartsWith(""https:"")) ?

Parent-Child one-to-one Relation same Table - EntityFramework," I have a question about how to realize a Table relationship in Microsoft SQL-Server 2012.I have a Table (MyTable) which should hold a Parent/Child structure.One Parent may have one Child and one Child only has one Parent.

(This is modelled via a nullable property)When I try to model this in MS-SQL I receive a table as follows.Here is my Code: The UNIQE Constraint should assure that there is at most one parent for one child.BUT Entity Framework won't let me change the properties to be a one-to-one relation.

Json.NET - Type is an interface or abstract class and cannot be instantiated," I will preface this by saying that I know what the problem is, I just don't know how to solve it. I am communicating with a .NET SOA data layer that returns data as JSON. One such method returns an object that has several collections within it. The object basically looks like this: My class that represents this object looks like this: This constructor worked fine until the cogCollection added a child collection, and now I am getting the above error. A concrete cog class looks like this: I don't want to change the collection to a concrete type because I am using IoC. Because I am using IoC I would really like to get away from the need to have the JsonConstructors that take concrete parameters, but I haven't figured out a way to do that. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!Update:Yuval Itzchakov's suggestion that this question is probably a duplicate is somewhat true (it seems). In the post referenced, one of the answers down the page provides same solution that was provided here. I didn't notice that answer, since the OP's question was different then the one I had here. My mistake. -------my solution--------As I said: Matt's solution took a little bit of work but I got something setup that works for me. The one thing I didn't like about his initial solution, were lines like these: Following this pattern you would need to have a JsonConverter for every abstract type that you receive over the wire. This is less than ideal in my situation, so I created a generic JsonConverter as such: Then just before I deserialize my data, I do something like this: Protip: If you use Resharper, (JsonConverter) will give you a suspicious cast warning in this scenario. Hopefully someone else finds this useful down the road! <code>  { ""Name"":""foo"", ""widgetCollection"":[{""name"",""foo""}, {""name"",""foo""},], ""cogCollection"": [{""name"",""foo""}, {""childCogs"",<<new collection>>},],} public class SuperWidget : IWidget{ public string Name { get; set; } public ICollection<IWidget> WidgetCollection { get; set; } public ICollection<ICog> CogCollection { get; set; } public SuperWidget() { } [JsonConstructor] public SuperWidget(IEnumerable<Widget> widgets, IEnumerable<Cog> cogs) { WidgetCollection = new Collection<IWidget>(); CogCollection = new Collection<ICog>(); foreach (var w in widgets) { WidgetCollection.Add(w); } foreach (var c in cogs) { CogCollection.Add(c); } }} [Serializable]public class Cog : ICog{ public string name { get; set; } public ICollection<ICog> childCogs { get; set; } } return objectType == typeof(ICog); public class GenericJsonConverter<T>: JsonConverter, IBaseJsonConverter<T>{ private readonly IUnityContainer Container; public GenericJsonConverter(IUnityContainer container) { Container = container; } public override bool CanConvert(Type objectType) { return objectType == typeof(T); } public override object ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, object existingValue, JsonSerializer serializer) { var target = serializer.Deserialize<Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject>(reader); var result = Container.Resolve<T>(); serializer.Populate(target.CreateReader(), result); return result; } public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, object value, JsonSerializer serializer) { serializer.Serialize(writer, value); }} var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings { TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.All }; settings.Converters.Add((JsonConverter)Container.Resolve<IBaseJsonConverter<ICog>>());",Type is an interface or abstract class and cannot be instantiated
C# | WPF - Custom Title Bar - Drag window from top when maximized doesnt work," I have a custom title bar and with the window style set to none.

What's wrong with my JWT signature?," I'm trying to implement the OpenID Connect specification for my organisation. I'm using Microsoft's OWIN implementation of OpenID Connect in a test relying party application to verify my implementation of the protocol.I've exposed the following metadata document: The signing key is exposed as this document: The identity token is being generated using the JwtSecurityToken class and its associated handler, using the X509SigningCredentials class. This code is representative of how the token is constructed and returned to the calling system as a parameter of the response data. When I attempt to pass the signed token back to the relying party application, the OWIN middleware accepts the POST and attempts to verify the signature of the token. In doing so, the following exception is thrown: SecurityTokenSignatureKeyNotFoundException: IDX10500: Signature validation failed.

How do I initialize log4net for a UnitTest project?," I have a Visual Studio unit test project for testing an ASP.NET MVC project.Adding the assembly-level log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator attribute to AssemblyInfo.cs doesn't work and other people on SO have found they have to use a direct call to log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.Configure();The question is, how can this be done for a unit test? The answer to use Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.AssemblyInitialize attribute on a class method doesn't work.For me, this code results in an InvalidOperationException logged in the output window and the test session bombs early. Reading the documentation, MSDN says not to use AssemblyInitialize on test projects for ASP.NET since they may be called more than once.So how can this be done so that log4net is configured before any tests are run? <code>  [TestClass]public sealed class Startup{ [AssemblyInitialize] public void Configure() { System.Diagnostics.Debug.Write(""Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.AssemblyInitialize""); }}",MSTest - How do I initialize log4net for a UnitTest project?

Interface naming convention for async method," Consider the following interface and implementations. According to the Microsoft naming conventions, should the interface method be named GetAnswer or GetAnswerAsync? By convention, you append ""Async"" to the names of methods that have an Async or async modifier.The problem is that the first implementation uses the async modifier, indicating it should receive the ""Async"" method name suffix, but the second implementation does not use the async modifier, indicating it should not receive the ""Async"" method name suffix. The two method names in the implementations are forced to be the same by the interface, so I am forced to violate the naming conventions for one of the two classes.Note I'm not looking for opinionated answers. Consider it multiple choice. :)You should use the ""Async"" suffix because the naming conventions say so. (With reference.)You should not use the ""Async"" suffix because the naming conventions say so. (With reference.)The naming conventions don't say. (This will need to come from someone well-versed in them.) <code>  interface IService{ Task<string> GetAnswer(string question);}class SomeService : IService{ async Task<string> IService.GetAnswer(string question) { ... code using awaits ... }}class AnotherService : IService{ Task<string> IService.GetAnswer(string question) { return Task.FromResult(""I have no idea.""); }}",Interface naming convention for method returning Task

Should I migrate to Entity?," I've been using the SqlCommand class and writing my own T-SQL queries for a very long time. I've stuck with it because I'm comfortable with it, and it probably stemmed from me starting as a windows developer in the days before we had many other great options. I've been doing web development now for about 10 years, and still using it and writing my own query strings. I've written a dynamic class for all my database needs on the fly, all I have to do is write the T-SQL, which I can do quickly and use in any project.Other developers have got big eyed when they see my code, and encourage me to learn LINQ which I do not like at all.I'm starting a new project now in ASP.NET MVC and now feel like I should get out of the dinosaur days and move to Entity Framework to handle my data.I know that the SqlCommand class is the nuts and bolts of the Entity Framework behind the scenes, so I feel like why should I go through the middle man (entity) to achieve the same results and spend time learning something new.Can someone please explain to me why I need to move on, or if I should stick with what I know? <code> ",Should I migrate to Entity Framework?

Always Running Threads with TPL on Windows Service," I'm writing a Windows Service that will kick off multiple worker threads that will listen to Amazon SQS queues and process messages. There will be about 20 threads listening to 10 queues.The threads will have to be always running and that's why I'm leaning towards to actually using actual threads for the worker loops rather than threadpool threads.Here is a top level implementation. Windows service will kick off multiple worker threads and each will listen to it's queue and process messages. Here is the implementation of the work I know I can perform the same operation with Task.Run and execute it on the threadpool thread rather than starting individual thread, but I don't see a reason for that since each thread will always be running.Do you see any problems with this implementation? How reliable would it be to leave threads always running in this fashion and what can I do to make sure that each thread is always running?  <code>  protected override void OnStart(string[] args){ for (int i = 0; i < _workers; i++) { new Thread(RunWorker).Start(); }} public async void RunWorker(){ while(true) { // .. get message from amazon sqs sync.. about 20ms var message = sqsClient.ReceiveMessage(); try { await PerformWebRequestAsync(message); await InsertIntoDbAsync(message); } catch(SomeExeception) { // ... log //continue to retry continue; } sqsClient.DeleteMessage(); }}",Always Running Threads on Windows Service

How are claims persisted accross requests?," Both claim1 and claim2 are persisted across requests only for the time ClaimsIdentity user is logged in. In other words, when user logs out by calling SignOut(), the two claims are also removed and as such the next time this user logs in, it is no longer a member of these two claims ( I assume the two claims don't exist anymore )The fact that claim2 is persisted across requests ( even though authentication cookie was already created when claim2 was added to the user ) suggests that claims don't get persisted across requests via authentication cookie, but via some other means.So how are claims persisted across requests?EDIT:1) As far as I can tell, claims of type IdentityUserClaim are never persisted in a cookie? If my assumption is correct, is the reason why IdentityUserClaim instances aren't persisted in a cookie because it is assumed that these claims should be stored in a DB and as such could in subsequent requests be retrieved from a DB, while claims of type Claim usually aren't stored in a DB and hence why they need to be persisted in a cookie?2) If you'd like to have a deeper look how it all works, check out the source code of Katana ProjectI thought Asp.net Identity 2 was not part of the Katana project ( namely, I've seen people asking when will Microsoft release the source code for Asp.Net Identity, even though Katana source code is already available )?!thank you <code>  var user = UserManager.Find(...);ClaimsIdentity identity = UserManager.CreateIdentity( user, DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie );var claim1 = new Claim( ClaimType = ClaimTypes.Country, ClaimValue = ""Arctica"", UserId = user.Id );identity.AddClaim(claim1);AuthenticationManager.SignIn( new AuthenticationProperties { IsPersistent = true }, identity );var claim2 = new Claim( ClaimType = ClaimTypes.Country, ClaimValue = ""Antartica"", UserId = user.Id );identity.AddClaim(claim2); var user = UserManager.Find(...);/* claim1 won't get persisted in a cookie */var claim1 = new IdentityUserClaim { ClaimType = ClaimTypes.Country, ClaimValue = ""Arctica"", UserId = user.Id };user.Claims.Add(claim1);ClaimsIdentity identity = UserManager.CreateIdentity( user, DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie );AuthenticationManager.SignIn( new AuthenticationProperties { IsPersistent = true }, identity );",Persisting claims across requests

Will the .Cancel() really cancel the method and throw OperationCancelledException?Thank you! <code>  string connString = """";string query = """";int val = 0;CancellationTokenSource tokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();using (IDbConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString)){ conn.Open(); val = (await conn.QueryAsync<int>(query, tokenSource.Token)).FirstOrDefault();} public static Task<IEnumerable<T>> QueryAsync<T> ( this IDbConnection cnn, string sql, dynamic param = null, IDbTransaction transaction = null, int? commandTimeout = null, CommandType? commandType = null );",CancellationToken with async Dapper methods?

What is it called when you edit an interface (C# example)," I am going through a LitJSON library. In the code there are lots of segments like For a method I know how overriding/overloading works but in the example above the code reads: int ICollection.CountI'm not familiar with that format for a method signature. Is the coder trying to explicitly state its the ICollection.Count interface? Could you explain what this is ""called"" (is it overriding still?).  <code>  public class JsonData : IJsonWrapper, IEquatable<JsonData> #region ICollection Properties int ICollection.Count { get { return Count; } } #end region",What is it called when you edit an interface?

OpenGL Frustum Culling Clipping Too Soon," I just recently added frustum culling to my voxel game; it worked pretty well at first glance. However, I immediately noticed that the frustum seems to be a little offbeing that some voxels near the edge of the window are prematurely cut-off, before completely falling out of visual scope. Here is an image that illustrates my endeavor:And Here are three classes which will likely be needed to solve this problem.My FrustumWidget Class: My FirstPersonCameraWidget class: And Lastly, my GameClient class: Anyone know what the deal is here? Because I am stumped.EDIT:I just noticed that if I use a different detecting method (SphereInFrustum) everything seems to work perfectly; nothing is clipped prematurely. Here is my new renderloop: As you can see I am passing in a sphere radius of 1.5f, and basically pretending all my Voxels are spheres. It works, and there is no premature clipping, however I want to use my VoxelWithinFrustum method. Can anyone spot if I did something wrong with that method?

AddOrUpdate not retrieving existing data for update," This might be a simple question, however I'm new to Code First and Migrations so bear with me. I'll keep sample code to a minimum to show the problem:I have a BaseAuditableEntity which includes this (among other things, but let's simplify): Now a (for example) User POCO inherits from it: I have this on my context's SaveChanges method, to fill in the CreatedOn and LastModified dates (simplified): And now I have a migration in place that seeds some users, like this: Now I have a problem on seeding with AddOrUpdate after the migration. When the entity is new (it's being added), CreatedOn gets filled correctly and everything works as expected. However when the entity is modified (it already exists on the database and UserName matches), it tries to update it with the new entity I'm creating... this fails because CreatedOn has an invalid DateTime (in this case, DateTime.MinValue).Is there any way to use the AddOrUpdate method so that it actually retrieves the matching entity from the database and just update the non-default fields? Or maybe some way to tell it which fields NOT to update? For this specific case, I'd like the CreatedOn field to be unchanged, but a generic solution would be appreciated.Maybe I should do my own AddOrUpdate method which includes a predicate with the fields I want to change, instead of passing it a completely new entity?This is EF 6.1UpdateI know I can easily solve this for the CreatedOn date, this is what I'm currently doing for this specific case: I am looking for a more generic solution though <code>  public abstract class BaseAuditableEntity : BaseEntity, IAuditableEntity{ public DateTime CreatedOn { get; set; } public DateTime LastModified { get; set; }} public class User : BaseAuditableEntity{ public string UserName { get; set; } public string PasswordHash { get; set; } public string FullName { get; set; } public string Email { get; set; } public bool Active { get; set; } public DateTime?

Check if string is valid represantion of HEX number," I am total noob regarding regex.My goal is to check whether a string is a valid representation of a hex number.Currently my implementation (which I find really inefficient) is having a List with all hex digits (0-9, A-F) and checking whether my string contains characters not contained in given List.I bet this can be easily done using regular expressions but I have no idea how to implement it. <code>  private bool ISValidHEX(string s){ List<string> ToCheck = new List<string>(); for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ToCheck.Add(i.ToString()); } ToCheck.Add(""A""); ToCheck.Add(""B""); ToCheck.Add(""C""); ToCheck.Add(""D""); ToCheck.Add(""E""); ToCheck.Add(""F""); for (int i = 0; i < s.Length; i++) { if( !ToCheck.Contains(s.Substring(i,1))) { return false; } } return true;}",Check if string is valid representation of hex number
Generate c# model class from csv file," The goal here is that after inputing csv file, a magic tool would output c# class with the fields from csv. Let's look at example.Input myFile.csv: Output myFile.cs So, the only thing I would need to fix is the types of properties. After that I would use this class with FileHelpers to read csv file. Later it would be mapped to EntityFramework class (using AutoMapper) and saved to database.Actually, https://csv2entity.codeplex.com/ looks like is doing what I need, but it just doesn't work - I installed it and nothing changed in my Visual studio, no new template appeared. The project is totally dead. Opened source code and ... decided maybe I'll just ask this question in stackoverflow :)FileHelpers has only a simple wizard, which allows you to manually add fields.

Best and efficient way to test equality of two IEnumerable<T>," Ok, I need to test if two IEnumerable<T> are equal.

The way I see it, all the linq methods shown in the referred answer (Count or Except) need to, if I'm not mistaken, iterate through the whole collection which in the general case is not necessary.I came up with this code, which works reasonably well (I think) and is fast enough.

"PayTrace Poodle The client and server cannot communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm"," I have an issue with a C# PayTrace Gateway.

What is the proper way to construct a Biginteger from an implied unsigned hexedicimal string in C#?," I'm running into a problem where as I have an implied unsigned hexadecimal number as a string, provided from user input, that needs to be converted into a BigInteger.Thanks to the signed nature of a BigInteger any input where the highest order bit is set (0x8 / 1000b) the resulting number is treated as negative. This issue however can't be resolved by simply checking the sign bit and multiplying by -1 or getting the absolute value due to ones's complement which will not respect the underlying notation e.g. treating all values 0xF* as a -1.As follows are some example input/output What is the proper way to construct a BigInteger from an implied unsigned hexadecimal string? <code>  var style = NumberStyles.HexNumber | NumberStyles.AllowHexSpecifier;BigInteger.TryParse(""6"", style) == 6 // 0110 binBigInteger.TryParse(""8"", style) == -8 // 1000 binBigInteger.TryParse(""9"", style) == -7 // 1001 binBigInteger.TryParse(""A"", style) == -6 // 1010 bin...BigInteger.TryParse(""F"", style) == -1 // 1111 bin...BigInteger.TryParse(""FA"", style) == -6 // 1111 1010 binBigInteger.TryParse(""FF"", style) == -1 // 1111 1111 bin...BigInteger.TryParse(""FFFF"", style) == -1 // 1111 1111 1111 1111 bin",What is the proper way to construct a BigInteger from an implied unsigned hexadecimal string?

C# does String.Replace() create a new string if there's nothing to replace?," For example: If I were to call ""ReplaceXYZ"" even for strings that do not contain ""X"", ""Y"", or ""Z"", would 3 new strings be created each time?I spotted code similar to this in one of our projects. It's called repeatedly as it loops through a large collection of strings. <code>  public string ReplaceXYZ(string text){ string replacedText = text; replacedText = replacedText.Replace(""X"", String.Empty); replacedText = replacedText.Replace(""Y"", String.Empty); replacedText = replacedText.Replace(""Z"", String.Empty); return replacedText;}",Does String.Replace() create a new string if there's nothing to replace?
How do I return the view with an API controller?," I'm implementing a REST Web API. I'm using the examples from Adam Freeman's Pro ASP.NET MVC5 as a starting point but adapting it into the Web API way of doing it.The below is my code: In the book, AdminController implemented Controller not ApiController, but if I do that then I get errors about there being no parameterless constructor. I need the constructor to take parameters so that I can inject the dependencies. So that's why I changed to ApiController but now it won't recognise View.What do I need to use instead of View for an ApiController? I did find this question but the answer was basically ""you don't need to use an ApiController here, just use Controller"" so that didn't help me. <code>  public class AdminController : ApiController{ private IUserRepository _repository; public AdminController(IUserRepository repository) { _repository = repository; } public ActionResult Index() { return View(_repository.Users); }}",Problems trying to return the view with an API controller
Howto check a type for parameterless constructor?," Because I want to avoid an exception, I want to check whether a type has a parameterless constructor. How can I achieve this?I need something like this: EDIT:I want to create an object of same type as source and if it hasn't a default constructor I want to use default(TT) instead.What I have right now is: But the check gives me true and CreateInstance throws exception No parameterless constructorSolution: There were many recursive functions and iterations involved and somewhere down this way, the wrong generic function HasDefaultConstructor (with type object) has been called. Using a non generic function did the trick.Thank you all for your constructive help. <code>  bool HasDefaultConstructor<TT>(TT source){ return ???;} static TT CreateObject<TT>(TT source) { try { if(!HasDefaultConstructor<TT>(source)) { return default(TT); } return (TT)Activator.CreateInstance(source.GetType()); } catch(Exception ex) { Trace.WriteLine(""Exception catched!\r\n"" + ex); } return default(TT); } static bool HasDefaultConstructor<TT>(TT source) { ConstructorInfo c = typeof(TT).GetConstructor(new Type[] { }); return c != null; } bool HasDefaultConstructor(Type t){ return t.GetConstructor(Type.EmptyTypes) != null;}",How to check a type for parameterless constructor?
Mixing TPH and TPT in Entity Framework 6 results in Error 3032," Initial situationI have an application that uses an existing database, currently using NHibernate as O/R-Mapper.Now I need to migrate to Entity Framework 6.1.1 using Code First and Fluent API Configuration.But now I have a problem with a part of the data model because it uses different types of inheritance strategies (TPT and TPH)StructureNote: Posting the complete data model here seemed a bit too enormous to me so I reproduced the problem I face in a small POC program. The column used as discrimator in the table is called TypeBased on this answer I added an abstract class Intermediate_TPH as intermediate layer:Some sample data: Entry with ID=3 is of type Inherited_TPTCodeThese are my entity classes and my context class: Running the following code will give me an error.

Design F# module to be called by C# (Console/MVC/WPF)," I have been trying to use Deedle F# Library to write an F# batch program. It has worked perfectly. However, I am not sure about the best design for the following 2 tasks:Combine the F# module into a existing ASP.net MVC/Web Api systemCreate a WPF interface to serve as a control panel and visual dependency controller for the various F# modules.The type of tasks the F# modules are doing are processing time series and applying statistical processes to derive new time series.I have been trying to create a class wrapper for the existing module so it can be called from C# code. I read from the C# Deep Dive that this is a better way to expose F# modules to C# callers.The following is a sample wrapper: The following is a sample module where most of the logic should reside: I have been trying to use NUnit to serve as a C# caller. I found myself putting most of the logic in the class do/let binding. The member methods are serving as passing the results to the caller. I don't think my approach is correct.Can someone point me to the right direction?

So when creating objects I do so like this: The ParentThing property is set to BsonIgnore because otherwise it would cause a circular reference when serialising to MongoDB.When I do serialize to MongoDB it creates the document exactly how I expect it to be: Here is the problem: When I deserialize I loose SubThing's reference to its parent. Is there any way to configure deserialization so that the ParentThing property is always its parent document? <code>  class Thing{ [BsonId] public Guid Thing_ID { get; set; } public string ThingName {get; set; } public SubThing ST { get; set; } public Thing() { Thing_ID = Guid.NewGuid(); }}class SubThing{ [BsonId] public Guid SubThing_ID { get; set; } public string SubThingName { get; set; } [BsonIgnore] public Thing ParentThing { get; set; } public SubThing() { SubThing_ID = Guid.NewGuid(); }} Thing T = new Thing(); T.ThingName = ""My thing""; SubThing ST = new SubThing(); ST.SubThingName = ""My Subthing""; T.ST = ST; ST.ParentThing = T; {""_id"" : LUUID(""9d78bc5c-2abd-cb47-9478-012f9234e083""),""ThingName"" : ""My thing"",""ST"" : { ""_id"" : LUUID(""656f17ce-c066-854d-82fd-0b7249c80ef0""), ""SubThingName"" : ""My Subthing""}",How to get a reference to the parent object in a deserialized MongoDB document?

Checking if type or instance impliments IEnumerable regardless of type T," I'm doing a heavy bit of reflection in my current project, and I'm trying to provide a few helper methods just to keep everything tidy.I'd like to provide a pair of methods to determine if a type or instance implements IEnumerable regardless of the type T. Here is what I have at the moment: When I test them using I get this as the result: The type method doesn't appear to work at all I had expected a true for the direct System.Collections.IEnumerable match at least.I'm aware that string is technically enumerable, albeit with a few caveats. Ideally in this case, however, I'd need the helper method to return false for it. I just need the instances with a defined IEnumerable<T> type to return true.I've probably just missed something fairly obvious can anyone point me in the right direction? <code>  public static bool IsEnumerable(this Type type){ return (type is IEnumerable);}public static bool IsEnumerable(this object obj){ return (obj as IEnumerable != null);} Debug.WriteLine(""Type IEnumerable: "" + typeof(IEnumerable).IsEnumerable());Debug.WriteLine(""Type IEnumerable<>: "" + typeof(IEnumerable<string>).IsEnumerable());Debug.WriteLine(""Type List: "" + typeof(List<string>).IsEnumerable());Debug.WriteLine(""Type string: "" + typeof(string).IsEnumerable());Debug.WriteLine(""Type DateTime: "" + typeof(DateTime).IsEnumerable());Debug.WriteLine(""Instance List: "" + new List<string>().IsEnumerable());Debug.WriteLine(""Instance string: "" + """".IsEnumerable());Debug.WriteLine(""Instance DateTime: "" + new DateTime().IsEnumerable()); Type IEnumerable: FalseType IEnumerable<>: FalseType List: FalseType string: FalseType DateTime: FalseInstance List: TrueInstance string: TrueInstance DateTime: False",Checking if Type or instance implements IEnumerable regardless of Type T

How does c# handle nested (sealed) (generic) types?

Does the compiler / CLR actually generate different types for these, or what rules are at play exactly...Example code: So even though the nested instance is created as a Private2.Nested it can not be casted to that type.

How many unique types (excluding valuetype-related) are actually generated, and if it is all the ""same"" type, is the restriction artificial (as in wouldn't an unsafe cast actually work)?

How to add an action to all event handler in a VS solution with multiple projects?," IntroductionI have a WPF application with code written in C#, developed in Visual Studio 2013. This is a GUI solution and has many interdependent projects, complete with buttons, fields, menus, checkboxes and text.Logging user actionsMy goal is to create a log file (a txt file will do) of all actions that an end user takes while using this application. Example actions could be a button-click, writing in a blank text field, (de)select a check-box, close an activity/tab, etc. I want to capture all such user interactions in the application UI, and have those actions stored as summarized one line descriptions of the action in a text log file.Possible solutionsBrute force methodOne way to do this could be to update the event handlers of all the aforementioned elements (button, textfield, ...) with the code to write a summary of the action to append to a txt log file. For example, in an accept button click handler: But this strategy will be very painful to accomplish, having to update each and every event handler (and even write event handlers for elements which don't have any currently).Better way(s)I am looking for a simpler way in which this could be achieved. Some ideas that I have are:One way is changing the event handler base class (that all other event handlers inherit from?) to contain the log file writing code. This way the log file code will need to be written only once, and it will be called whenever any event handler is called, which is what we want (There needs to be a distinction made between a user generated events and an app generated event, which can prove difficult in case of event chaining. So this could be a challenge).Another way is using some ""sniffer"" which works like a debugger and stores the stack trace of an application's methods, as the user moves through it.

Adding a time stamp to the message would be useful... ... because, deleting the messages which have a time stamp difference from that of the previous message below a suitable threshold, would leave only the methods that were directly called by the user actions.

C# async - Will every 'await' operator result in a state machine?," Please consider the following code: This code demonstrate a most basic functionality - nested async methods. Will every method get translate into a state machine? Or is the compiler sophisticated enough to generate a more efficient structure? In some of my projects, there are ~20 methods between the UI/WebAPI and the I/O call - does that affect the trade-off between the async-await overhead (such as the state machine) and the non-blocking thread benefits? I mean, if, for example, the overhead of 4 state machines (4 nested async methods) equals to 50ms of blocking I/O (in terms of trade-off), will 20 state machine be equal to longer I/O's delay (250ms)?  <code>  public async Task<string> GetString(){ //Some code here... var data = await A(); //Some more code... return data;}private async Task<string> A(){ //Some code here.. var data = await B(); //manipulating data... return data;}private async Task<string> B(){ //Some code here.. var data = await C(); //manipulating data... return data;}private async Task<string> C(){ //Some code here.. var data = await FetchFromDB(); //manipulating data... return data;}private async Task<string> FetchFromDB(){ return await SOME_HTTP_REQUEST;}",Will every 'await' operator result in a state machine?

How to contraint concurrency the right way in Rx.NET," Please, observe the following code snippet: The problem with this code is that getResultAsync runs concurrently in an unconstrained fashion. Which could be not what we want in certain cases. Suppose I want to restrict its concurrency to at most 10 concurrent invocations. What is the Rx.NET way to do it?I am enclosing a simple console application that demonstrates the subject and my lame solution of the described problem.There is a bit extra code, like the Stats class and the artificial random sleeps. They are there to ensure I truly get concurrent execution and can reliably compute the max concurrency reached during the process.The method RunUnconstrained demonstrates the naive, unconstrained run. The method RunConstrained shows my solution, which is not very elegant. Ideally, I would like to ease constraining the concurrency by simply applying a dedicated Rx operator to the Monad. Of course, without sacrificing the performance. <code>  var result = await GetSource(1000).SelectMany(s => getResultAsync(s).ToObservable()).ToList(); using System;using System.Collections.Generic;using System.Diagnostics;using System.Linq;using System.Reactive.Linq;using System.Reactive.Threading.Tasks;using System.Threading;using System.Threading.Tasks;namespace RxConstrainedConcurrency{ class Program { public class Stats { public int MaxConcurrentCount; public int CurConcurrentCount; public readonly object MaxConcurrentCountGuard = new object(); } static void Main() { RunUnconstrained().GetAwaiter().GetResult(); RunConstrained().GetAwaiter().GetResult(); } static async Task RunUnconstrained() { await Run(AsyncOp); } static async Task RunConstrained() { using (var sem = new SemaphoreSlim(10)) { await Run(async (s, pause, stats) => { // ReSharper disable AccessToDisposedClosure await sem.WaitAsync(); try { return await AsyncOp(s, pause, stats); } finally { sem.Release(); } // ReSharper restore AccessToDisposedClosure }); } } static async Task Run(Func<string, int, Stats, Task<int>> getResultAsync) { var stats = new Stats(); var rnd = new Random(0x1234); var result = await GetSource(1000).SelectMany(s => getResultAsync(s, rnd.Next(30), stats).ToObservable()).ToList(); Debug.Assert(stats.CurConcurrentCount == 0); Debug.Assert(result.Count == 1000); Debug.Assert(!result.Contains(0)); Debug.WriteLine(""Max concurrency = "" + stats.MaxConcurrentCount); } static IObservable<string> GetSource(int count) { return Enumerable.Range(1, count).Select(i => i.ToString()).ToObservable(); } static Task<int> AsyncOp(string s, int pause, Stats stats) { return Task.Run(() => { int cur = Interlocked.Increment(ref stats.CurConcurrentCount); if (stats.MaxConcurrentCount < cur) { lock (stats.MaxConcurrentCountGuard) { if (stats.MaxConcurrentCount < cur) { stats.MaxConcurrentCount = cur; } } } try { Thread.Sleep(pause); return int.Parse(s); } finally { Interlocked.Decrement(ref stats.CurConcurrentCount); } }); } }}",How to constraint concurrency the right way in Rx.NET

LINQ Max with Group By from multiple fields," I am trying to get the latest contact with a given user, grouped by user: The user's contact info could either be in SentTo or SentFrom. would give me the latest message, but I need the last message per user.The closest solution I could find was LINQ Max Date with group by, but I cant seem to figure out the correct syntax. I would rather not create multiple List objects if I don't have to. If the user's info is in SentTo, my info will be in SentFrom, and vice-versa, so I do have some way of checking where the user's data is.Did I mention I was very new to LINQ? Any help would be greatly appreciated. <code>  public class ChatMessage{ public string SentTo { get; set; } public string SentFrom { get; set; } public string MessageBody { get; set; } public string SendDate { get; set; }} List<ChatMessage> ecml = new List<ChatMessage>();var q = ecml.OrderByDescending(m => m.SendDate).First();",How do I group on one of two possible fields using LINQ?

lambda parameter conflicting with class field on accessing field in later scope," I've got a weak imagination when it comes to names, so I often find myself re-using identifiers in my code. This caused me to run into this specific problem.Here's some example code: Here are the compilation errors (output by ideone): Line 11 contains test++, line 9 contains the lambda.Incidentally, Visual Studio 2013 gives a different error: The error occurs at the increment on line 11 only.The code compiles successfully if I comment out either line 9 (the lambda) or line 11 (the increment).This issue is a surprise to me - I was sure that lambda parameter names can conflict only with local method variable names (which is sort of confirmed by the code compiling when I comment out the increment). Also, how can the lambda parameter possibly affect the increment, which is right outside the lambda's scope?I can't get my head around this... What exactly did I do wrong? And what do the cryptic error messages mean in this case?EDIT after all the great answers:So I think I finally understood the rule that I broke. It is not well-worded in the C# spec (7.6.2.1, see Jon Skeet's answer for the quote). What it was supposed to mean is something like:You can not use the same identifier to refer to different things (entities) in the same ""local variable declaration space"" if one of the offending uses is (directly) located in a scope which can be ""seen"" from the scope where the other is (directly) located.Not the standard's standard phrasing, but I hope you understood what I mean. This rule was supposed to allow this: because neither of the scopes of the two variables a can be ""seen"" from the other's scope;and disallow this: because the second variable declaration is ""seen"" from the first variable's scopeand disallow this: because the increment of the field can be ""seen"" from the block's scope (it not being a declaration doesn't matter).It seems that C#6 changed this rule, specifically making the last example (and my original code) legit, though I don't really understand how exactly.Please correct me if I made some mistakes in these examples. <code>  public delegate void TestDelegate(int test);public class Test{ private int test; private void method(int aaa) { TestDelegate del = test => aaa++; test++; } public static void Main() { }} prog.cs(11,3): error CS0135: `test' conflicts with a declaration in a child blockprog.cs(9,22): (Location of the symbol related to previous error)Compilation failed: 1 error(s), 0 warnings 'test' conflicts with the declaration 'Namespace.Test.test' { int a;}{ int a;} { int a;}int a; class Test{ int test; void method() { { int test; } test++; }}",Lambda parameter conflicting with class field on accessing field in later scope

C# register event handler for specific subclass," Ok, code structure question:Let's say I have a class, FruitManager, that periodically receives Fruit objects from some data-source. I also have some other classes that need to get notified when these Fruit objects are received. However, each class is only interested in certain types of fruit, and each fruit has different logic for how it should be handled. Say for example the CitrusLogic class has methods OnFruitReceived(Orange o) and OnFruitReceived(Lemon l), which should be called when the respective subtype of fruit is received, but it doesn't need to be notified of other fruits.Is there a way to elegantly handle this in C# (presumably with events or delegates)? Obviously I could just add generic OnFruitReceived(Fruit f) event handlers, and use if statements to filter unwanted subclasses, but this seems inelegant. Does anyone have a better idea? Thanks!Edit: I just found generic delegates and they seem like they could be a good solution. Does that sound like a good direction to go? <code> ",Register event handler for specific subclass

C# Properties and Auto-Implementations," I'm using .NET 4.5 in a VSTO addin for outlook 2013. I'm having some trouble fully grasping properties and accessors. Auto-implemented accessors which I assume are when you just write get; set; rather than get { //code }, etc. are also giving me trouble. I have a dictionary I use internally in my class. Here is my code: then later on: I am using the same names as the properties in the code later on, within the same class.I never actually write: to create the variables I just was using the property directly.I tried changing my code to do this, and I had some issues and realized my understanding of properties is a bit mixed up.Here are a few questions I need clarified that I can't seem to find the correct answer to.First, is there any reason to use a private property? My dictionaries are never accessed outside of the class or in any derived classes so is there a reason to even use properties? I don't use any special validation or anything in the setter or anything like that. Second, when I tried to change my code to use variables and then access them via the properties like your typical property example would, I ran into problems. I found an example where the getter was set to return _clientDict, but the setter was just set; It gave me the error: that I must give set a body because it's not abstract or partial. Why would it not auto-implement the setter for me in this instance?Last, when I call new on the properties in the same class that it is declared in, what is the difference between doing that with a property and a normal variable of the same type? Do properties differ at all from variables in that case? Is it bad practice to use properties this way when it should be accomplished with private variables? These may be some misguided questions but I can't find any other place that has the information to help me understand these distinctions. I've been playing around with properties to try and figure all of this out but I could use so me assistance. <code>  private Dictionary<string, string> clientDict { get; set; }private Dictionary<string, string> clientHistoryDict { get; set; } clientDict = new Dictionary<string, string>();clientHistoryDict = new Dictionary<string, string>(); private Dictionary<string, string> _clientDict; // etc.",Properties and auto-implementations

Isolate exceptions in an AppDomain," TL;DR: How do you isolate add-in exceptions from killing the main process?I want to have a very stable .Net application that runs less stable code in an AppDomain. This would appear to be one of the prime purposes of the AppDomain in the first place (well, that and security sandboxing) but it doesn't appear to work.For instance in AddIn.exe: Called in my 'stable' code with: The exception thrown in the AppDomain gets passed straight to the application that created the domain. I can log these with domain.UnhandledException and catch them in the wrapper application.However, there are more problematic exceptions thrown, for instance: This will throw a stackoverflow exception that kills the entire application every time. It doesn't even fire domain.UnhandledException - it just goes straight to killing the entire application.In addition calling things like Environment.Exit() from inside the AppDomain also kill the parent application, do not pass GO, do not collect 200 and don't run any ~Finialiser or Dispose().It seems from this that AppDomain fundamentally doesn't do what it claims (or at lease what it appears to claim) to do, as it just passes all exceptions straight to the parent domain, making it useless for isolation and pretty weak for any kind of security (if I can take out the parent process I can probably compromise the machine). That would be a pretty fundamental failure in .Net, so I must be missing something in my code.Am I missing something? Is there some way to make AppDomain actually isolate the code that it's running and unload when something bad happens?

HTTP Post to Web API 2 - Options request recieved and handled no further request recieved," I have a web application using MVC and AngularJS, which connects to a Web API 2 api, that I have set up in a separate project. Currently I am able to retrieve information from the Api with no problems. However when I try to do a HTTP Post I am getting no response, originally I was getting a problem with the pre-flight request failing, I have now handled this in my controller, however it does not send the proper request after it has got an OK message back.I have included my code for the Angular Factory and the C# Controller in the API. Edit: I am still not having any joy with this, however I tested in Internet Explorer and it works with no problems at all. I have got it working in chrome by starting with web security disabled, however obviously this is not ideal as it will not work on a user PC with security enabled.  <code>  [EnableCors(origins: ""*"", headers: ""*"", methods: ""*"")]public class RegisterController : ApiController{ public string Post() { return ""success""; } public HttpResponseMessage Options() { return new HttpResponseMessage { StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.OK }; }}var RegistrationFactory = function($http, $q, ApiAddress) {return function(model) { // $http.post(ApiAddress.getApiAddress() + '/Register/Post', model.ToString()); $http({ method: ""POST"", url: ApiAddress.getApiAddress() + '/Register/Post', data: model, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8' } }).success(function(data) { $location.path(""/""); });}};RegistrationFactory.$inject = ['$http', '$q', 'ApiAddress'];",HTTP Post to Web API 2 - Options request received and handled no further request received

C# DateTime AddDays Inaccurate / Unexpected Offset," I have a very simple DateTime object that is set to the date 01-01-0001. I am supplied a value to add to this DateTime, in days. I am seeing an unexpected offset in my results though, of two days. Let's pretend I print out the results of the AddDays() call, like so: With the value seen above (735768.0) I expect an output of ""6/18/2015 12:00:00 AM"". However, instead I get ""6/20/2015 12:00:00 AM"". When I go to the following website and calculate the duration in days between 01-01-0001-->06/18/2015 I get a value of 735,768 days, as expected:http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=01&d1=01&y1=0001&m2=06&d2=18&y2=2015Am I doing something wrong, or is there something going on under the hood that I am not aware of?In case you are wondering, the 735,768 represents the first time value of the data that I am working with. The data is expected to start at 06/18/2015 00:00:00.Edit: I should note I merely provided that particular website as an example of a conflicting source. Other websites, including the government weather agency I get the data from all give me 06-18-2015. This doesn't mean C# is wrong. I am more so curious as to where this offset came from, and why. <code>  DateTime myDateTime = DateTime.Parse(""01-01-0001 00:00:00"");Console.WriteLine(myDateTime.AddDays(735768.0));",C# DateTime AddDays Unexpected Offset

Calling methods who ever extends the Parent Class," How would you create a Class that whichever class extends the Class, methods are automatically invoked/called. Just edit my question if it sounds misleading. I'll just showcase some samplesExample 1:In unity when you extend monobehavior your methods are automatically called. I don't know if I'm right. on libgdx As What I have Understand and Tried Implementing it my self I'm sorry, but I still really don't know how it works or what you call this technique.Especially in unity, when creating multiple controllers that extends Monobehavior, all that controllers method that been implemented are called. Who's calling this classes and methods? Some reference or books on this would be a great help. Note: Please edit my title for the right term to use on this. thanks <code>  public class MyController : MonoBehaviour { void Start() { //Being Called Once } void FixedUpdate() { //Being Called every update} Game implements ApplicationListener { @Override public void render () { //Called multiple times }} public abstract Test{ protected Test(){ onStart(); } public abstract void onStart();}public class Test2 extends Test{ public Test2(){ } @Override public void onStart(){ //Handle things here }}",Calling methods from a super class when a subclass is instantiated
SignalR: How to truly call a hub's method from C#," I'm trying to improve my application which will require calling a hub from C# instead of javascript. The current workflow for adding a task in my app is:make an API call to add the data to the databasereturn new record to AngularJS controllerinvoke hub's method from controllerhub broadcasts call to clients appropriatelyWhat I would like to do is bypass calling the hub's method from my AngularJS controller and call it directly from my API controller method. This is what my hub currently looks like: There are many SO threads out there on the topic, but everything I've read would have me adding the following code to my API controller: There are number of issues with this. First and foremost, I want the client broadcast calls to exist in a single class, not called directly from my API controller(s). Secondly, hubContext is an instance of IHubContext rather than IHubCallerConnectionContext. This means I only have access to all clients and couldn't broadcast different responses to the Caller and Others like I'm currently doing.Is there a way to truly call a hub's method from C# and, ideally, have access to the different caller options? Ideally, I'd be able to do something as easy as the following from my API controller (or better yet, a solution with DI): Thanks in advance.SOLUTIONFor posterity, I thought I'd include my full solution as per Wasp's suggestion. First, I modified my javascript (AngularJS) service to include the SignalR connection ID in a custom request header for the API call, in this case an INSERT: Then, I retrieved the connection ID from the request in my API controller after performing the applicable CRUD operation and then called my hub: My hub looks like this where I'm now only using static methods called from my API controller: As you can see, I have a conditional statement in my hub method to handle if the hub call wasn't initiated from the client side portion of my app. This would be if an external app/service called my API. In such a situation, a SignalR connection and of course ""ConnectionId"" header value would not exist. In my case, though, I still would want to call the onInsertTask method for all connected clients which informs them of the data change. This should never happen, but I just included it for completeness. <code>  public class TaskHub : Hub{ public void InsertTask(TaskViewModel task) { Clients.Caller.onInsertTask(task, false); Clients.Others.onInsertTask(task, true); }} var hubContext = GlobalHost.ConnectionManager.GetHubContext<TaskHub>();hubContext.Clients.All.onInsertTask(task); var taskHub = new TaskHub();taskHub.InsertTask(task); var addTask = function (task) { var config = { headers: { 'ConnectionId': connection.id } }; return $http.post('/api/tasks', task, config);}; public HttpResponseMessage Post(HttpRequestMessage request, [FromBody]TaskViewModel task){ var viewModel = taskAdapter.AddTask(task); var connectionId = request.Headers.GetValues(""ConnectionId"").FirstOrDefault(); TaskHub.InsertTask(viewModel, connectionId); return request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, viewModel);} public class TaskHub : Hub{ private static IHubContext context = GlobalHost.ConnectionManager.GetHubContext<TaskHub>(); public static void InsertTask(TaskViewModel task, string connectionId) { if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(connectionId)) { context.Clients.Client(connectionId).onInsertTask(task, false); context.Clients.AllExcept(connectionId).onInsertTask(task, true); } else { context.Clients.All.onInsertTask(task, true); } }}",SignalR: How to truly call a hub's method from the server / C#

Using QueryAsync to return a single object," Unfortunately, our DB is dated back to the 90s. Its legacy is so strong that we are still using SP in order to do most of the CRUD operations. However, it seems that Dapper suits pretty well and we have just started to play with it.However, I'm a bit concerned about how to handle a single data row. In this case, I'm using QueryAsync to call the SP passing an ID. As you can see, the object is returning outside of the async call(*).Am I going to be in trouble? If so, does anyone know how to handle it? Do I need to use a QuerySync instead? (*)The SchemePolicy object returned by FirstOfDefault() is not an async method. <code>  public class SchemePolicyRepository : ISchemePolicyRepository{ private readonly SqlConnection sql; protected SchemePolicyRepository(SqlConnection connection) { sql = connection; } ... public async Task<SchemePolicy> GetById(string id) { var schemePolicy = await sql.QueryAsync<SchemePolicy>(""risk.iE_GetSchemePolicyById"", new { Id = id }, commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure); return schemePolicy != null ? schemePolicy.FirstOrDefault() : null; } ...}",Using Dapper QueryAsync to return a single object

Entity framework throws exception while exceuting UPDATE statement," I have an EF6 powered program that crashes on an UPDATE statement, when running for the first time.I tried renaming the columns via data annotations (I didn't test fluid API, since it should result in the same database). I also looked at the class visibilities, but they didn't change since the last time the program worked and thus can be ruled out.I've looked at it for the better part of a day, but cannot find the error. The database looks sound to me and the code compiles without problem. Also any update-database statements are executed without an exception.Here is the stack-trace: Here is the method that throws the exception. The exception is thrown on at the include statement. I might add, that the class for the following two methods is internal sealed These are the classes that represent my data: And here are the SQL statements for the DB schema. As per suggestion of John Castleman I changed the Schema initialisation, which was previously done by FluidAPI to DataAnnotations. Then I added another migration and applied another update-database now I get an error when I run the command, not just when starting the program.Below is the error and my migrations:This is the stack trace with the -verbose switch enabled. I had to delete the old one, since I reached the character limit. Migrations: The funny thing is: Even though the second migration is empty the update-database command fails. The first migration runs just fine, but then I get an error when starting the program.As additional information here is the constructor of my repository and the configuration file for it. <code>  System.Data.DataException was unhandled by user code HResult=-2146233087 Message=An exception occurred while initializing the database.

Is using ref keyword for string parameters in methods good for performance in C#?," As a programmer who don't have a good idea about the .NET pipeline, I was wondering if using ref strings as parameters are good for performance in C#?Let's say I have a method like this: When I use this method, the compiler creates a copy of the text for the method, right?But if I use the ref keyword: .. the compiler should only send the text's pointer address...So is it good for performance using ref like this? <code>  public int FindSomething(string text){ //Finds a char in the text and returns its index} public int FindSomething(ref string text){ //Finds a char in the text and returns its index}",Is using the 'ref' keyword for string parameters in methods good for performance in C#?

Ensure data deserialization," I have 3 ObservableCollections in my ViewModel and one Class which I load when you run an app.To ensure ObservableCollections are deserialized I just got. If there is no file, deserializationMethod will create new object with That works fine - no problem with that.And for class I have I added a property - if file is deserialized then it's true.It looks like it works but it is NOT. It happens very rarely but sometimes file is not deserialized and when you use an app this file is overwritten so every data are destroyed. I cannot find what is causing the problem. It is that you just run an app and it happens - like once per 100 runs.How to be very sure that if file exist then it will be deserialized for sure?Or maybe I should make List of these ObservableCollections + Class and serialize it to one file? Is there any good practice with that?EDIT:I used SemaphoreSlim to ensure that everything is used as it supposed to, but today it happened again.The thing is it happens when app is started and nothing else is even tapped. There is no way that something is writing at this moment. It looks like data is not deserialized or is not reading the file that exist. Because every changes are written with closing an app then everything is gone.Any other ideas what it might be or how to be sure that data are deserialized?EDIT FINAL - reproduced problem:I finally reproduced what is going on. So I've removed edits with code that wasn't necessary here.I have BackPressed event to handle when user is going back or want to exit an app (if on MainPage).This part of code apparently was causing the problem. What is going on exactly.First thing is that problem isn't possible to be reproduced using emulator.My BackPressed method contained await with serializing method that saved the data that were later gone (so as Ondrej Svejdar has written it was writing before reading). BUT I started to test it and there is strange behaviour and I still have some questions about it.How it happens.When I started an app (by accident e.g.) and loading screen occurs I start to tap back button few times -> app isn't running it is closing ASAP and I can't even see a UI (sometimes I am able to see AppBar for a moment). Then when I try to open app again (doesn't matter if immediately or later) it is ""resuming"" and after this exact moment my data are gone. But not all of the data. Only the last one saved with await within BackPressed method. Only this one. I tried to save One, Two and Three ObservableCollections with and without this Class and ALWAYS the last one was saved ""empty"". After this awaits I got Application.Current.Exit() method that might cause this, but I'm not sure if this should matter when serializing method is Task and only the last one is wrongly serialized.When I remove this awaits from BackPressed method I can't reproduce this issue so this is it.Questions I still have are: Is this behavior expected? Is there better method to close an app and ensure serializing data or I just should save it during using an app not while exiting it? <code>  if(SomeCollection.Count == 0) ThisCollection = await deserializationMethod<ObservableColletion<T>>(filename); return Activator.CreateInstance<T>(); if(ClassObject.Loaded != true) ThisObject = await deserializationMethod<T>(filename);",Ensure data deserialization / serialization

Handling / receiving live stream from WebRTC or any browser based capturing mechanism to the server using ASP.NET MVC," We need to capture a live video stream from WebRTC (or any other capturing mechanism from the client webcam, even if it is not supported on all browsers, but as a PoC).This live video needs to be handled by a server component (ASP.Net MVC / Web API), I imagine that the code on the server will look like: Looking for any keyword or helpful link. We have already implemented a way to send individual frames using base64 jpg, but this is not useful at all, because there is a huge overhead of the base64 encoding and because we could use any video encoding to send the video more efficiently (send the difference between the frames using VPx -vp8- for example), the required solution needs to capture a video from the webcam of the client and send it live (not recorded) to the server (asp.net) as a stream -or chunks of data representing the new video data-. <code>  [HttpPost]public ActionResult HandleVideoStream(Stream videoStream){ //Handle the live stream}",Handling / receiving live video webcam stream from WebRTC or any browser based capturing mechanism to the server using ASP.NET MVC

How to do batch processing of CSV file using TPL/Dataflow for best peformance?," I wrote the following method to batch process a huge CSV file.

Near the end he states: The rules for resolving names after the aforementioned colon are not well founded; you can end up in situations where you need to know what the base class is in order to determine what the base class is.By colon he is referring to the inheritance operator (e.g. Dog : Animal).What situation is Eric referring to?

"disable capturing context in all librabry code, ConfigureAwait(false)"," When using await, by default the SynchronizationContext (if one exists) is captured and the codeblocks after the await (continuation blocks) is executed using that context (which results in thread context switches). While this default might make sense in the context of the UI where you want to be back on the UI-thread after an asynchronous operation completes, it doesn't seem make sense as the default for most other scenarios. It certainly doesn't make sense for internal library code, becauseIt comes with the overhead of unnecessary thread context switches.It is very easy to accidentaly produce deadlocks (as documented here or here).It seems to me that Microsoft have decided for the wrong default.Now my question:Is there any other (preferably better) way to solve this than by cluttering all await calls in my code with .ConfigureAwait(false)? This is just so easy to forget and makes the code less readable. Update:Would it maybe suffice to call await Task.Yield().ConfigureAwait(false); at the beginning of each method? If this would guarantee me that I will be on a thread without a SynchronizationContext aferwards, all subsequent await calls would not capture any context.  <code>  public async Task DoSomethingAsync(){ // We are on a thread that has a SynchronizationContext here. await DoSomethingElseAsync(); // We are back on the same thread as before here //(well sometimes, depending on how the captured SynchronizationContext is implemented)}","disable capturing context in all library code, ConfigureAwait(false)"

Storing requests in objects. Some trick needed," I have been working on a client - server project. The server side implemented on PHP. The client implemented on C#. The websocket is used for connection between them.So, here is the problem. Client will make a request. Json is in use for sending objects and validating against the schema. The request MUST HAVE it's name and MAY contain args. Args are like associative array (key => value).Server will give a response. Response MAY contain args, objects, array of objects. For example, client sends a request like: For this, server will reply with an AuthSuccess or AuthFailed response like: If response is AuthSuccess, client will send a requst of who is online. Server must send an array of users. And so on. So the problem is, how to store those responses on a client side. I mean, the way of creating a new object for each response type is insane. They will be hundreds of request types, and each of them requires it's own response. And any changing in structure of request will be very very hard...Need some kind of pattern or trick. I know it's kind of a noob way... But if anyone has a better idea of implementing request/response structure, please tell it.Best regards! <code>  { ""name"": ""AuthenticationRequest"", ""username"": ""root"", ""password"": ""password"", ""etc"": ""etc"" } { ""name"": ""AuthFailed"", ""args"": [ { ""reason"": ""Reason text"" }] }",Parsing (many) JSON different objects to C# classes.

Instantiate MonoBehaviour in unity3d unit test," I have the following open source project on Github (game project). I'm currently trying to unit test the code I wrote with the MSTest framework but all the tests return the same error message : ""Unhandled Exception: System.Security.SecurityException: ECall methods must be packaged into a system module."" This happened when I tried to unit test with the NUnit template. I've looked through the ECall methods post must be packagedto find some answers but I did not because the OP said that his solution work when inside the debugger region but not outside of it. The issue of the OP, as far as I'm concerned, when looking at the post, was not resolved.Afterwards, I imported the UnityTestTools framework inside my project. Thought it would be easy enough since it was based on the NUnit framework. Turns out that no. The test in itself is fairly basic. I have this base class, called BaseCharacterClass:MonoBehavior, which has, among other things, the property of type BaseCharacterStats. In the stats, there an object of type CharacterHealth which, well, takes care of the health of a player. Right now, I have the two following stack traces that I don't seem to get when I tried the following in my test.

Linq alternative to retrieving Lookup values by key," I am working on the following code to find a ""description"" based on a search phrase that the user will specify. Think of the Keys as important phrases and the Values as a description on where to go to find that phrase.Think of it as a store locator for example (best analogy I can think up). If you search ""Target"" (key), you'll get tons of cities (value) and some may have the same name. So there can be multiple Targets in the same city.A Dictionary will obviously not work, because I'll either have duplicate store names, or possibly duplicate city names. Which brings me to my actual situation:Basically, I'm starting from a List<KeyValuePair<string, string>> to allow for duplicates in both directions, then converting that to a Lookup<string, string> which I assumed would be less confusing than it is turning out to be. The above is simply fake test information, but I feel like there must be a cleaner way to get the results from the Lookup especially since it appears to be very Linq-friendly. Unfortunately, I am quite unfamiliar with Linq, and the syntax of Linq itself doesn't seem to lend itself to be very beginner-friendly. I get the results in this code (hard coded search term just for testing purposes): I don't have issues with the above code, but my question is: Is there a way to use Linq to achieve what I am trying to accomplish? I feel like what I have is not the best way this could be done...It may be worth noting that a partial searchTerm must also be able to find results where it occurs in the key (hence contains). Existing answers weren't quite able to answer my specific questions. I was not able to find one to help me get values by a partial key search. <code>  List<KeyValuePair<string, string>> kvpList = new List<KeyValuePair<string, string>>();Lookup<string, string> collection;kvpList.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, string>(""K1"", ""R1""));kvpList.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, string>(""K1"", ""R1""));kvpList.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, string>(""K1"", ""R2""));kvpList.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, string>(""K2"", ""R1""));kvpList.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, string>(""K2"", ""R2""));kvpList.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, string>(""K2"", ""R3""));kvpList.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, string>(""K2"", ""R1""));collection = (Lookup<string,string>)kvpList.ToLookup(k => k.Key, k => k.Value); string searchTerm = ""K2"";List<string> uniqueResults = new List<string>();foreach (var item in collection){ if (item.Key.Contains(searchTerm)) { foreach (var value in item) { if (!uniqueResults.Contains(value)) { uniqueResults.Add(value); Console.WriteLine(""Added: "" + value); } else { Console.WriteLine(""Skipped duplicate: "" + value); } } }} ",Linq alternative to retrieving Lookup values by key (or partial key)

Detect if non DPI-aware application has been scaled," I'm trying to detect in a WinForms application if it has been launched in scaled/virtualized mode due to the OS having a high DPI. Currently, in a system running at 3840x2400 with 200% scaling, the application sees the resolution as 1920x1200, the DPI as 96, and the scale factor is 1. We are in the process of making the application DPI-aware, but until then, we need a ""quick fix"" that will allow us to detect if scaled. The reason for this is that it breaks a functionality in the application that takes a screenshot. We use the scaled dimensions in Graphics.CopyFromScreen, it takes a screenshot of the wrong size since it is expecting the non-scaled dimensions.I am aware of the DPI-awareness setting, but for the moment, we still want the application to be scaled, but be able to detect that we are scaled and get the non-scaled dimensions, if possible. <code> ",Detect if non DPI-aware application has been scaled/virtualized

Why does this BigInteger value cause an overflow exception? C#," I am using BigInteger in C# in connection with the factorial function. The program has a lightning fast calculation of 5000!, but has an overflow error at 10000!. According to wolfram alpha, 10000! is approximately10000! = 2.8 x 10^35659From what I can tell from this post, a BigInteger is stored in an int[] array. If I interpret the int type correctly, it uses 4 bytes, meaning that 10000! uses about 4 x log10(2.8 x 10^35659) = 142636 bytes, where I use log10(n) (the log to base 10) as an approximation to the number of digits of n.

About async/await's Bad Effects," According to this link: When you are awaiting on a method with await keyword, compiler generates bunch of code in behalf of you. One of the purposes of this action is to handle synchronization with the UI thread. The key component of this feature is the SynchronizationContext.Current which gets the synchronization context for the current thread. SynchronizationContext.Current is populated depending on the environment you are in. The GetAwaiter method of Task looks up for SynchronizationContext.Current. If current synchronization context is not null, the continuation that gets passed to that awaiter will get posted back to that synchronization context. When consuming a method, which uses the new asynchronous language features, in a blocking fashion, you will end up with a deadlock if you have an available SynchronizationContext. When you are consuming such methods in a blocking fashion (waiting on the Task with Wait method or taking the result directly from the Result property of the Task), you will block the main thread at the same time. When eventually the Task completes inside that method in the threadpool, it is going to invoke the continuation to post back to the main thread because SynchronizationContext.Current is available and captured. But there is a problem here: the UI thread is blocked and you have a deadlock! I have trouble understanding the bolded part of the statement above, but when I test the code above, it deadlocks as expected.But I still can't understand why the UI thread is blocked?In this case, what is the available SynchronizationContext? Is it the UI thread? <code>  public class HomeController : Controller { public ViewResult CarsSync() { SampleAPIClient client = new SampleAPIClient(); var cars = client.GetCarsInAWrongWayAsync().Result; return View(""Index"", model: cars); } } public class SampleAPIClient { private const string ApiUri = ""http://localhost:17257/api/cars""; public async Task<IEnumerable<Car>> GetCarsInAWrongWayAsync() { using (var client = new HttpClient()) { var response = await client.GetAsync(ApiUri); // Not the best way to handle it but will do the work for demo purposes response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); return await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<IEnumerable<Car>>(); } } }",async/await deadlocking when using a SynchronizationContext

Using C# IndexOf with substring," Suppose you have a string (""haystack""), and a substring you want to search for (""needle""): I'm looking for a way to find the index or substring after the substring being sought.Calling IndexOf() returns the start position of the needle, such that index = 9 in this case: My initial thought was to use LastIndexOf(), but that returns the start index of the last occurrence of the needle in the haystack.As is answered in this similar question (and probably others), if you wanted to locate the character immediately following needle, it is required to increment index by the length of the needle like this: Is there a method (existing, or perhaps easy to extend) aside from typing index + needle.Length every time that allows you to determine the ending index of a substring?  <code>  string haystack = ""D0B11234 AM21ANP AM23AN1""; string needle = ""AM21AN""; int index = haystack.IndexOf(needle); int index = haystack.IndexOf(needle);int indexAfterNeedle = index + needle.Length;",Finding the index after a substring

How to keep drawn shapes after the form is refreshed? [C#]," I am trying to create a small paint application in Visual Studio 2015. My project falls into the category of Windows Form Applications. I have the following problem: This part of my codes creates a Rectangular (2nd if), a line segment(3rd if) and just a line. It works pretty much the same as MS Paint; the rectangular or the line segment isn not completed until the user releases the left mouse click (Mouse up). But when a rectangular is finally made when I try again to create another one, the form refreshes ( Refresh(); ) and I lose all the previous drawn rectangulars or lines. I tried replacing Refresh(); with Invalidate(rect); and Update();, but I do not get the result I want.Instead, I get this:  <code>  private void Form1_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (a == 1) { if (r == 1 || el == 1) { int x = Math.Min(inX, e.X); int y = Math.Min(inY, e.Y); int width = Math.Max(inX, e.X) - Math.Min(inX, e.X); int height = Math.Max(inY, e.Y) - Math.Min(inY, e.Y); rect = new Rectangle(x, y, width, height); Refresh(); } else if (l == 1) { ep = e.Location; Refresh(); } else { ep = e.Location; g = this.CreateGraphics(); g.DrawLine(p, sp, ep); sp = ep; } } }",How to keep drawn shapes after the form is refreshed?

Enable Cors in ASP.NET WebApi 2.3," I'm trying to enable CORS but I constantly have the same problem for each request sent from my AngularJS web app: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://.../... (Reason: CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing). And it only occurs with Firefox! It works perfectly with Chrome, Safari, IE and Edge.Environment:My API is a .NET Web Api 2.3 (.NET 4.6) hosted on Azure App Services (IIS 8.0).My front app is a AngularJS webapp that I access via https and which consumes the API via https.What I did:I have a Startup class which is declared as the startup entry point for Owin. I have a WebApiConfig class which is declared as below: I did not touch web.config to manually add headers (I tried, but it didn't solve my problem). Anyway, it's not recommended to add these headers in web.config and to have app.UseCors() at the same time.So, on Firefox, I have the CORS error, but on Safari/Chrome, no problem! I have the Access-Control-Allow-Origins everywhere except Firefox.On Chrome:On Firefox:EDIT:Well, I've investigated a bit more, and if I switch my webapp address from https:// to http://, everything works fine on Firefox (also, my API can be consumed by Angular via https with no CORS problem at all) ... I really don't understand what's going on, but magically, Access-Control-Allow-Origin appears on every API routes consumed by Firefox, which was not the case when it was a secure connection (https). I rely on https Azure certificate from Microsoft, which seems to be valid (the lock icon is green). Of course, I would like to keep https, but I don't know how I can solve my issue.Seems to be related to: Firefox CORS request giving 'Cross-Origin Request Blocked' despite headersI've made a rewrite rule regarding the web app client (which hosts AngularJS). In my web.config, I have: When I remove it, it's fine (my web app is accessible using HTTP), but when I switch to HTTPS, and even though the API server accept all origins, it fails.So the question: Should I add something special to make HTTPS/Certificate works with CORS (under Firefox)?Also related: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33743645/iis-reverse-proxy-to-bypass-cors-issue <code>  [assembly: OwinStartup(typeof(Startup))]namespace SentinelleApi{ public class Startup { public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app) { app.UseCors(Microsoft.Owin.Cors.CorsOptions.AllowAll); app.Map(""/signalr"", map => { map.UseCors(Microsoft.Owin.Cors.CorsOptions.AllowAll); var hubConfiguration = new HubConfiguration { EnableDetailedErrors = true, EnableJavaScriptProxies = false }; map.RunSignalR(hubConfiguration); }); HttpConfiguration config = new HttpConfiguration(); WebApiConfig.Register(config); app.UseWebApi(config); } }} namespace SentinelleApi{ public static class WebApiConfig { public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config) { // No need to declare config.EnableCors() here, the app.UseCors(...) does the job in startup section // Web API routes config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes(); config.Routes.MapHttpRoute( name: ""DefaultApi"", routeTemplate: ""api/{controller}/{id}"", defaults: new {id = RouteParameter.Optional} ); } }} <rule name=""RedirectToHTTPS"" stopProcessing=""true""> <match url=""(.*)"" /> <conditions> <add input=""{HTTPS}"" pattern=""off"" ignoreCase=""true"" /> <add input=""{URL}"" pattern=""/$"" negate=""true"" /> <add input=""{REQUEST_FILENAME}"" matchType=""IsFile"" negate=""true"" /> </conditions> <action type=""Redirect"" url=""https://{SERVER_NAME}/{R:1}"" redirectType=""SeeOther"" /> </rule>","No Access-Control-Allow-Origin with Firefox, but works with Chrome and Safari"
Azure Web Api Scaffolding - Generator not found," Summary: When creating a new Web Project in Visual Studio 2015 (Update 1), im unable to use the scaffolding tool for Controllers that relates to Entity Framework.Same issue occures with VS2013 Update 5It returns the following message: There was an error running the selected code generator: There was an error getting the type ""failtest.Models.TestModelClass"". Try rebuilding the project. I have tried to rebuild it, but still nothing. Anyone got a clue about why im getting this? I actually re-installed my Windows 10 system to see if this could fix this error. - Now, that beeing said, it was in need for some tough love anyway, so i figgured it was about time - Maybe its crashing because i have tried a vast amount of node stuff in the past time, and permission errors. But the error occured both before and after i re-installed it. (complete whipe)This is a Fresh install of Visual Studio 2015 Professional - Basically nothing else has been added to the system yet. When i first started this post, i created a blank project for my screenshots just to show the entire process (below) - And i tought i was loosing my mind. At first, the testproject suddenly worked, so i created a second project to test again. And then it failed with the same error. So just to confirm, i deleted the first project that worked, and set it up again with the exact same name and file location as the one that suddenly worked ( after deleting all folders and existing project files ) - And now it keeps failing again. How to reproduce: Create a new ""Azure Api App"" project - Leave all settings as default (Any project type will produce the same result actually)Create a new ModelBuild your project (this is mentioned on an article from Microsoft to be nesesary to use the scaffolder) Add a new Controller by right clicking the ""Controllers"" folder, and selecting New -> Controller - Select ""Web Api 2.0 controller with actions, using Entity Framework""Fill out the information, since this is a new project, we dont have a context - so click the + icon and create a new one. Error is producedEDIT: Packages.config : Web.Config : EDIT 2: I Suspect that this is an EntityFramework issue, as the scaffolder works for everything that doesnt include EntityFramework.

Setting Xamarin.Forms binding in code behind," I'm trying to set binding on a TapGestureRecognizer in code and I can't figure out the right way to do it. The working xaml looks something like this...

WCF passing header values via Channel," I have a WCF service which requires an application ID parameter to be passed to each service call. Currently my exposed methods require a parameter. I want to try and push this information into the Channel headers. My WCF is hosted using Net.tcp. Here is my client proxy code: (The commented out line is what I want to use going forward).Server code: In the _context object there are private methods containing my header, but publicly in the _context.IncomingRequest.Headers I get this: There is no HttpRequestMessageProperty on the incoming Message.So my question is, am I suffering because I am not hosting on HTTP? Is there a way to trick the server to give me access to those headers by adding some pseudo HTTP headers? Or can I get at the private members maybe via reflection? <code>  public class CustomerClient : ClientBase<ICustomerBrowser>, ICustomerBrowser{ public Customer Get(string ApplicationID, string CustomerId) { try { using (OperationContextScope _scope = new OperationContextScope(this.InnerChannel)) { MessageHeader _header = MessageHeader.CreateHeader(""AppID"", string.Empty, ApplicationId); OperationContext.Current.OutgoingMessageHeaders.Add(_header); return Channel.Get(ApplicationId, CustomerId); // return Channel.Get(CustomerId); } } }} var _context = WebOperationContext.Current;var h = _context.IncomingRequest.Headers;",Using a WCF OperationContext in passing header values via Channel
CreatePerOwinContext ignoring paths," Short:For each and every request a new OWIN context is created, I would like to be able to prevent this for certain resource types or paths (images, css, js).Full:In our application start-up we register a dbcontext creation delegate so that the dbcontext will be created just once per request. If a client makes a request for the style sheet, an OWIN context will be created an thus a new dbcontext will also be created. I would like to be able to either not create the OwinContext at all, or at least to be able to prevent some of it's ""on create"" callbacks to be executed for certain request types/paths.Alternatively, as I can see why the approach of (partially) ""disabling"" OWIN would lead to problems, I would like to hear what the best practice would be? How can I serve a static file without creating a database context for each request? (small remark here is that our static files are embedded resources served using a virtual path provider... The problem also occurs for ""normal"" static files.)Background: Yesterday I started noticing that every now and then some parts of our application did not load. Sometimes it was single image, sometimes the entire CSS file. After some investigation I saw that some requests were throwing http 500 errors, the exception thrown was often things like a SQL connection time out (but also other exceptions).While we are of course trying to fix those exceptions. I do believe it to be complete nonsense for our application to set up a database connection when a client makes a request for a single image... That's about 10 database connections for a single page request???Seems to me like such an obvious problem but I have been Googling all of yesterday and found nothing close to a solution or work around. What am I missing stack?EDIT: I just tried an approach where I did not actually create the dbcontext but a stub instead. In hindsight this obviously is not the solution to this problem as the OwinContext tries to continue it's process and will critically fail when it tries to get the user from the database using that stub dbcontext.

Ignore Owin for static files," Short:For each and every request a new OWIN context is created, I would like to be able to prevent this for certain resource types or paths (images, css, js).Full:In our application start-up we register a dbcontext creation delegate so that the dbcontext will be created just once per request. If a client makes a request for the style sheet, an OWIN context will be created an thus a new dbcontext will also be created. I would like to be able to either not create the OwinContext at all, or at least to be able to prevent some of it's ""on create"" callbacks to be executed for certain request types/paths.Alternatively, as I can see why the approach of (partially) ""disabling"" OWIN would lead to problems, I would like to hear what the best practice would be? How can I serve a static file without creating a database context for each request? (small remark here is that our static files are embedded resources served using a virtual path provider... The problem also occurs for ""normal"" static files.)Background: Yesterday I started noticing that every now and then some parts of our application did not load. Sometimes it was single image, sometimes the entire CSS file. After some investigation I saw that some requests were throwing http 500 errors, the exception thrown was often things like a SQL connection time out (but also other exceptions).While we are of course trying to fix those exceptions. I do believe it to be complete nonsense for our application to set up a database connection when a client makes a request for a single image... That's about 10 database connections for a single page request???Seems to me like such an obvious problem but I have been Googling all of yesterday and found nothing close to a solution or work around. What am I missing stack?EDIT: I just tried an approach where I did not actually create the dbcontext but a stub instead. In hindsight this obviously is not the solution to this problem as the OwinContext tries to continue it's process and will critically fail when it tries to get the user from the database using that stub dbcontext. The dbcontext is not the problem, I need to completely bypass Owin...

Custom Colour palette in Visual Studio (Not Theme)," Within the Visual Studio Designer, under the properties window you are able to select the ForeColor, BackColor etc using color picker. When you want to pick a color, a color picker comes up with the tabs 'Custom, Web, System'.If you select custom, then you are able to add a new color to the picker, but only the bottom 2 rows are changeable, and the changes don't persist across controls. So if you add a color to the palette, when you select another control and want to change for example BackColor your previous added color is not there.Is there a way to create and import a custom set of colors into the designer's color-picker control?Note: This question isn't asking about VS themes, or if colors can be implemented as a class in the code-behind. I'm after a way to tailor the designer. <code> ",Custom Color Palette in Visual Studio Color Property Editor

Duplicate requests when debugging ASP.NET on IIS Express," I noticed a strange behavior while debugging an ASP.NET Web Application (.NET 4.6.1). Whenever an HTTP error occurs (e.g. 404 or 403) the request get duplicated up to a total of 3 times.I have tested this singular issue using fiddler, and Intellitrace effectively shows me the three identical requests (even if I send just a single request).I can see the effects of this issue because any Owin middleware in the pipeline is invoked three times.

I already tried VS2015, VS2013 and also I deleted the complete reference and add it again, but it's the same. <code>  public SilverlightApplication.ServiceReferenceDoc.Document Document SilverlightApplication.ServiceReferenceDoc.Document1 Document",service reference proxy class renamed

".NET Standard, .Net Core, PCL"," .NET Standard has been a confusing concept. The idea of a standard .NET library format sounds great. But, it's not clear what it is exactly. There are now .NET Core, and .NET Standard Class Library project templates in Visual Studio, as well as the old PCL projects. I also found that if you go in to the settings for the project, you can switch an existing PCL library over to .NET Standard. It's not clear if .NET standard is a library? Or a DLL format.The basic question I'm asking is which type of library should we be targeting? I'm mainly doing this for Xamarin projects, but it would be great if we could share these libraries with other platforms, especially .NET Core, and UWP. It's confusing as to why Microsoft brought out two seemingly identical Class Library types at the same time: .NET Core, and .NET Standard. DefinitionsNET Core - a .NET based runtime environment which conforms to the .NET Standard API definition.PCL - a .NET based library format supported by several runtime environments including .NET, Mono, UWP, and so on.NET Standard (Definition 1) - A set of standard API definitions for .NET based runtime environments.NET Standard (Definition 2) - a .NET based library format supported by several runtime environments including .NET, Mono, UWP, and so on which is a continuation of the PCL format. In Visual Studio, a PCL library can be converted to a .NET Standard library by going in to the properties of the project and editing the target framework. <code> ",".NET Standard, .NET Core, PCL"

Changing the behavior of the console in C# ConsoleApp," I've got a console application that executes my code without user interaction. If the user clicks within the console window, on purpose or on accident, all execution stops. This has something to do with copying text from the console window.

When you click on the console window, the Task thread stops executing. This is not desirable behavior at all, and I want to prevent this from happening in my console application.How can I prevent this?

In that case I could create another class with a named JSON attribute which contained a C# List but I am trying to provide an appropriate model mapping for JSON which returns a list of items within an unnamed array.Any ideas how I could approach this? <code>  [{""ProductCode"":""0129923083091"",""Description"":""DIESEL "",""SalesLitres"":6058.7347,""SalesValue"":6416.2000},{""ProductCode"":""0134039344902"",""Description"":""UNLEADED "",""SalesLitres"":3489.8111,""SalesValue"":3695.7100},... ] namespace App8.Models { public class ReportRow { [JsonProperty(""ProductCode"")] public string ProductCode { get; set; } = string.Empty; [JsonProperty(""Description"")] public string Description { get; set; } = string.Empty; [JsonProperty(""SalesLitres"")] public double SalesLitres { get; set; } = 0.0; [JsonProperty(""SalesValue"")] public double SalesValue { get; set; } = 0.0; } }",Deserializing an unnamed array
WPF - Notify property change defined in the ViewModel when underlying Model data changes," Question: What is the proper way to update a bounded UI element to show the values of property defined only in the ViewModel after a property in an individual item in list changes value.When implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged in a class that are going to be the items in list, it only updates the UI element that specific piece of data is bound to. Like a ListView item or DataGrid cell. And that's fine, that's what we want. But what if we need a total's row, like in an Excel table. Sure there are several ways to go about that specific problem, but the underlying issue here is when the property is defined and calculated in the ViewModel based on data from the Model. Like for example: When and how does that get notified/updated/called?Let's try this with a more complete example.Here's the XAML This is the Model: And the ViewModel: I know this is code looks over simplified, but it's part of a larger, frustratingly difficult application.All I want to do is when I change an item's value in the DataGrid I want the ItemsTotal property to update the TxtTotal textbox.So far the solutions I've found include using ObservableCollection and implementing CollectionChanged event.The model changes to: And the viewmodel changes to: This solution works, but it just seems like a work around hack that should have a more eloquent implementation. My project has several of these sum properties in the viewmodel and I as it stands, that's a lot of properties to update and a lot of code to write which just feels like more overhead. I have more research to do, several interesting articles came up while I was writing this question. I'll update this post with links to other solutions as it seems this issues is more common than I thought. <code>  public class ViewModel{ public double OrderTotal => _model.order.OrderItems.Sum(item => item.Quantity * item.Product.Price);} <Grid> <DataGrid x:Name=""GrdItems"" ...

Volitile variables," I recently had an interview with a software company who asked me the following question: Can you describe to me what adding volatile in front of variables does? Can you explain to me why it's important?Most of my programming knowledge comes from C, yet the job position is for C# (I thought I might add this bit of info if necessary for the question specifically)I answered by saying it just lets the compiler know that the variable can be used across processes or threads, and that it should not use optimization on that variable; as optimizing it can deteriorate behavior. In a nutshell, it's a warning to the compiler.According to the interviewer, however, it's the other way around, and the volatile keyword warns the OS, not the compiler. I was a bit befuddled by this, so I did some research and actually found conflicting answers! Some sources say it's for the compiler, and others for the OS.Which is it? Does it differ by language? <code> ",Volatile variables
"Control or access ""Rotate 180 degree"" checkbox for printers in C#"," I have multiple printers which contain a ""Rotate 180 degree"" checkbox like below:Here's another one (""Nee"" means ""no""):Is there a way to programmatically set this value, and change PrintTicket? If not, how can I get the current value of it? For my software I need to know if this is set or not and if it's set it needs to be changed, if possible. For my software it would be the best if I don't have to open the printdialog, it's a piece of software where users can print directly without clicking any buttons, so setting or getting it programmatically is what I'm looking for.I've been searching around using ManagementObjectSearcher and in the normal PrintDocument.DefaultPageSettings property but couldn't find anything! If this option isn't set, I automatically want to set it temporarily for the users (otherwise it prints upside down with my particular printers). I've been messing around trying to set it for the users but I can't figure out how to get it to work. I've been looking at the DEVMODE struct and tried to implement it but it also doesn't have a ""rotate 180 degrees option"" or anything similar.NOTE: I'M NOT TRYING TO SET LANDSCAPE MODE. That's pretty easy and something different.I tried doing the following: pdialog.PrintQueue.CurrentJobSettings.CurrentPrintTicket.PageOrientation = PageOrientation.ReversePortrait; However, this only inverts the page orientation and not the content (the content needs to be rotated as well). If I rotate the visual that I'm printing, the margins aren't right anymore so that doesn't work either! Hope someone can help. Thanks in advance.EDITI used Hans' method to figure out which value to change. Note that his method would apply for any type of printer! The devmode changes the value of the PrintDialog. This took me hours and hours to solve so for whoever I can help, here's my code and I'm glad to share or help! First I was trying to change DefaultPrintTicket from a new PrintServer() which didn't work, but UserPrintTicket seemed to be the right one where you can actually see the value change in WindowsControl Panel if you don't switch back to the original one. *However*, this only seemed to work on just my pc (which was necessary), on a virtual machine for example themagic` value was already different. This was rather practice than real-life usage. ... The value in the printdialog changes, but it still prints wrong. The changes don't apply. Any help is welcome! <code>  var pdialog = new PrintDialog();pdialog.PrintQueue = new PrintQueue(new LocalPrintServer(), _printername, PrintSystemDesiredAccess.AdministratePrinter); // this will be your printer. any of these: new PrintServer().GetPrintQueues()pdialog.PrintTicket.PageMediaSize = size;pdialog.PrintTicket.CopyCount = _amount;if (CheckPrinterDriverName(_printername)){ int magic = 361; var defaulttckt = pdialog.PrintQueue.UserPrintTicket; pdialog.PrintQueue.UserPrintTicket = PrinterModifier.ChangeDevMode(pdialog, magic, vis); pdialog.PrintQueue.Commit(); pdialog.PrintVisual(vis, ""Label""); //Set back old settings so it's not permanently changed pdialog.PrintQueue.UserPrintTicket = defaulttckt; pdialog.PrintQueue.Commit();} class PrinterModifier{ public static PrintTicket ChangeDevMode(PrintDialog pdialog, int prpty, DrawingVisual vis) { var queue = pdialog.PrintQueue; var cvt = new PrintTicketConverter(queue.Name, PrintTicketConverter.MaxPrintSchemaVersion); // Display dialog, don't make changes var devmode1 = cvt.ConvertPrintTicketToDevMode(pdialog.PrintTicket, BaseDevModeType.UserDefault); // Consistency check var dmSize = BitConverter.ToInt16(devmode1, 68); var dmDriverExtra = BitConverter.ToInt16(devmode1, 70); if (devmode1[361] == 0) { devmode1[361] = 1; } return cvt.ConvertDevModeToPrintTicket(devmode1, PrintTicketScope.PageScope); }}",Control or access custom printer settings (Rotate 180 degrees) for printers in C#

Unit testing WebAPI controller methods who return IActionResult," I'm in the process of building an ASP.NET Core WebAPI and I'm attempting to write unit tests for the controllers. Most examples I've found are from the older WebAPI/WebAPI2 platforms and don't seem to correlate with the new Core controllers.My controller methods are returning IActionResults. However, the IActionResult object only has a ExecuteResultAsync() method which requires a controller context. I'm instantiating the controller manually, so the controller context in this instance is null, which causes an exception when calling ExecuteResultAsync. Essentially this is leading me down a very hacky path to get these unit tests to successfully complete and is very messy. I'm left wondering that there must be a more simple/correct way of testing API controllers.Also, my controllers are NOT using async/await if that makes a difference.Simple example of what I'm trying to achieve:Controller method: Unit test: <code>  [HttpGet(Name = ""GetOrdersRoute"")]public IActionResult GetOrders([FromQuery]int page = 0){ try { var query = _repository.GetAll().ToList(); int totalCount = query.Count; int totalPages = (int)Math.Ceiling((double)totalCount / pageSize) - 1; var orders = query.Skip(pageSize * page).Take(pageSize); return Ok(new { TotalCount = totalCount, TotalPages = totalPages, Orders = orders }); } catch (Exception ex) { return BadRequest(ex); }} [Fact]public void GetOrders_WithOrdersInRepo_ReturnsOk(){ // arrange var controller = new OrdersController(new MockRepository()); // act IActionResult result = controller.GetOrders(); // assert Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, ????);}",Unit testing controller methods which return IActionResult

What is causing Azure Event Hubs' ReceiverDisconnectedException?," I'm receiving events from an EventHub using EventProcessorHost and an IEventProcessor class (call it: MyEventProcessor). I scale this out to two servers by running my EPH on both servers, and having them connect to the Hub using the same ConsumerGroup, but unique hostName's (using the machine name).The problem is: at random hours of the day/night, the app logs this: This Exception occurs at the same time as a LeaseLostException, thrown from MyEventProcessor's CloseAsync method when it tries to checkpoint. (Presumably Close is being called because of the ReceiverDisconnectedException?)I think this is occurring due to Event Hubs' automatic lease management when scaling out to multiple machines. But I'm wondering if I need to do something different to make it work more cleanly and avoid these Exceptions? Eg: something with epochs? <code>  Exception information: Exception type: ReceiverDisconnectedException Exception message: New receiver with higher epoch of '186' is created hence current receiver with epoch '186' is getting disconnected.

The code below illustrates itCode ProblemMy application crashes after clicking Refresh button in ReportViewer a few times.This is what I found in the Event Viewer > Windows Logs > ApplicationMessage: An exception was not handled in an AsyncLocal notification callback. I tried googling for the error but came up short.CluesThis problem does not happen in debug mode (Visual Studio 2015)This problem does not happen when I rapidly click the OK button.This problem does not happen when I add redundant/test codes (e.g., MessageBox.Show()) after this.rpvCustomReport.RefreshReport(); line in btnOk_Click event. But when I add them before that line, the problem happens. This was how I concluded that the this.rpvCustomReport.RefreshReport(); was causing the problem.QuestionsWhy did that problem occur?What are the steps I should perform to be able to debug this kind of problem in the future?WorkaroundIn order to fix this, I have to cancel the event before calling btnOk_Click.

Replacement for DataTable/DataSet in .NET Core," .NET Core 3.1 supports DataTable/DataSet, DataRow, DataView, etc - which was not available when the OP created the following questionbased on my research, it seems like .net core does not support DataTable/DataSet. I recently shifted to .net core for developing a new application, but failed to recognize that .net core does not have library for those in the first place. I used to use dt/ds for fetching the data via stored procedure and fill collection of classes. But now, I am quite lost with this new problem that I have to find replacement for dt/ds. To be more specific, I used to do this:I have a stored procedure that takes four input parameters and returns a table. and create a class with same fields as I have in my stored procedure. and fetch data and fill collection of class My bad, I should have researched more before I initiated the project, but I really need anyone's help to find replacement for the above code. Would it be possible to use .net core's FromSql method as a replacement?

Remove any explicit definitions of the CONTRACTS_FULL symbol from your project and rebuild.

Discard changes to context in EF Core," I have a huge list of ""flattened"" objects in json format, and a somewhat complicated relational DB schema (with about 20 tables corresponding to a flattened object). I'm trying to automate the insertions of those flattened objects in my new relational database: The Insert() method callsAddRangeAsync() and AddAsync() for a number of related objects in different tables.Since the flattened objects are legacy, I'd say about 0.001% of them are malformed and will violate DB constraints - for example trying to insert a duplicate composite primary key in one of the tables.I expect these rare errors, thus my idea is - wrap the whole Insert() operation in a transaction - if any piece of the operation is invalid, just don't insert anything and log the error, so I can modify the flattened object manually before trying again. Thus my code looks somewhat similar to this: However, if an error occurs somewhere in my try block (I try to insert an object that violates a composite primary key) my whole context object becomes corrupt. The object that caused the exception still remains in my DbContext and any following call to AddAsync() in a different transaction triggers a new exception.I tried recreating my DbContext and repo for every new object in the foreach loop above - but even then if I query: I see my old object is still in the new instance of dbContext.Is there any (elegant) way to tell my context to reset all pending changes - so that I can put it in the catch block whenever an error occurs? I want everything that happens within my failed transaction to stay there and not leak. <code>  foreach (var flattenedObject in flattenedObjects){ _repository.Insert(flattenedObject).Wait(); //some time logging, etc} public async Task Insert(FlattenedObject fo){ using (var transaction = _context.Database.BeginTransaction()) { try { //magical code that calls AddAsync for multiple tables } catch (Exception ex) { transaction.Rollback() //logging } }} _context.ChangeTracker.Entries().Where(e => e.State != EntityState.Unchanged);",How to discard changes to context in EF Core

The presence of WindowsFormsHost causes the IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged to be fired only twice and not more," I discover a very strange behavior of WindowsFormsHost in WPF. I find that if a WPF control doesn't have WindowsFormsHost as a child control, then IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged fires properly-- it is fired whenever the WPF control gains or loses focuses, and the variable IsKeyboardFocusWithin is toggled as expected ( true when the control gains focus, false when loses focus).But, if I host a WindowsFormHost in WPF, then after a short while, the IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged event is no longer fired for both the WPF mother control and the WindowsFormHost child control. I can't find in MSDN documentation or SO why so, any reason?This is my code:MainWindow.xaml MainWindow.xaml.cs When the lines involving WindowsFormHost are commented out, then IsKeyboardFocusWithin is true whenever the control gains focus, and false when the control loses focus.When the lines involving WindowsFormHost are there, then IsKeyboardFocusWithin is true, until I click on the control, and then host.IsKeyboardFocusWithin becomes false, and IsKeyboardFocusWithin also becomes false, and then, no matter what I do, IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged event will never be fired again.  <code>  <Window x:Class=""WpfApplication1.MainWindow"" xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"" xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"" xmlns:d=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"" xmlns:mc=""http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"" xmlns:local=""clr-namespace:WpfApplication1"" mc:Ignorable=""d"" Title=""MainWindow"" Height=""350"" Width=""525"" IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged=""Window_IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged""> <Grid Name=""grid1""> </Grid></Window> public partial class MainWindow : Window{ public MainWindow() { InitializeComponent(); host = new System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost(); var mtbDate = new System.Windows.Forms.MaskedTextBox(""00/00/0000""); host.Child = mtbDate; host.IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged += Host_IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged; grid1.Children.Add(host); } private void Host_IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged(object sender, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine(host.IsKeyboardFocusWithin.ToString()+"" blah""); } private System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost host; private void Window_IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged(object sender, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine(IsKeyboardFocusWithin.ToString()); }}",The presence of WindowsFormsHost causes the IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged to be fired at most twice and not more

Understanding async/await vs Wait in C#," One method is a standard async method, like this one : I have tested two implementations, one that use await and the other uses .Wait()The two implementations are not equal at all because the same tests are failing with the await version but not the Wait() one.The goal of this method is to ""execute a Task returned by the input function, and retry by executing the same function until it works"" (with limitations to stop automatically if a certain number of tries is reached).This works: And this (with async t => and the usage of await instead of t => and the usage of .Wait() doesn't work at all because the result of the recursive call is not awaited before the final return; is executed : I'm trying to understand why this simple change does change everything, when it's supposed to do the exact same thing : waiting the ContinueWith completion.If I extract the task ran by the ContinueWith method, I do see the state of the ContinueWith function passing to ""ranToCompletion"" before the return of the inner await completes.Why?

C# - Reuse of for loop iteration variable," I have seen a lot of questions about whether to declare variables inside or outside a for loop scope. This is discussed at length, for example here, here, and here. The answer is that there is absolutely no performance difference (same IL), but for clarity, declaring variables in the tightest scope is preferred.I was curious about a slightly different situation: versus I expected both methods to compile to the same IL in Release mode. However, this is not the case. I'll spare you the full IL and just point out the difference. The first method has one local: while the second has just two locals, one for each for loop counter: So there is a difference between these two which is not optimized away, which is surprising to me.Why am I seeing this, and is there actually a performance difference between the two methods? <code>  int i;for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Console.WriteLine(i);}for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Console.WriteLine(i);} for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Console.WriteLine(i);}for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Console.WriteLine(i);} .locals init ( [0] int32 i) .locals init ( [0] int32 i, [1] int32 i)",Reuse of for loop iteration variable

Asynchronous methods in .Net/C#," I was reading up on async/await and when Task.Yield might be useful and came across this post. I had a question regarding the below from that post: When you use async/await, there is no guarantee that the method you call when you do await FooAsync() will actually run asynchronously. The internal implementation is free to return using a completely synchronous path.This is a little unclear to me probably because the definition of asynchronous in my head is not lining up.In my mind, since I do mainly UI dev, async code is code that does not run on the UI thread, but on some other thread. I guess in the text I quoted, a method is not truly async if it blocks on any thread (even if it's a thread pool thread for example).Question:If I have a long running task that is CPU bound (let's say it is doing a lot of hard math), then running that task asynchronously must be blocking some thread right? Something has to actually do the math. If I await it then some thread is getting blocked.What is an example of a truly asynchronous method and how would they actually work? Are those limited to I/O operations which take advantage of some hardware capabilities so no thread is ever blocked? <code> ",Confusion regarding threads and if asynchronous methods are truly asynchronous in C#

DDD validation without exceptions," I am attempting my first foray into DDD, and I asked a question about bulk imports here, but I am going in circles trying to apply the validation for my domain model. Essentially I want to run through all the validation without throwing exceptions so that I can reject the command with all the validation errors via a list of CommandResult objects inside the Command object. Whilst some are just mandatory field checks which are configurable and so will be handled outside the aggregate, there are also business rules, so I don't want to duplicate the validation logic and don't want to fall into an anaemic model by moving everything outside the aggregate to maintain the always-valid mantra of entities.I am at a bit of a loss, so thought it be best I ask the experts if this I am going about things correctly before I start muddying the waters further! To try and demonstrate:Take the below, we have fairly simple UserProfile aggregate, the constructor takes the minimum information required for a profile to exist. I then have a method which accepts a command object, which will construct a UserProfile and save to the database, but I want to validate before saving Now, I could handle exceptions and add them to the command result, but that seems expensive and surely violates the rule of allowing exceptions to control flow? but on the other hand I want to keep entities and value object valid, so I find myself in a bit of a rut!Also, in the example above, the profile could be imported or done manually from a creation screen, but the user should get all error messages rather than each one in the order they occur. In the application I am working on, the rules applied are a bit more complex, but the idea is the same. I am aware that I shouldn't let a UI concern impact the domain as such, but I don't want to have to duplicate all validation twice more so that I can make sure the command won't fail as that will cause maintainability issues further down the line (the situation I find myself in and trying to resolve!) <code>  public class UserProfile : AggregateRoot { public Guid Id {get; private set; } public Name Name {get private set;} public CardDetail PaymentInformation {get; private set;} public UserProfile(Guid id, Name name, CardDetail paymentInformation) { Name = name; PaymentInformation = paymentInformation; } }public class CardDetail : ValueObject{ public string Number {get; private set;} public string CVC {get; private set; } public DateTime? IssueDate {get; private set;} public DateTime ExpiryDate {get;private set;} public CardDetail(string number, string cvc, DateTime? issueDate, DateTime expiryDate) { if(!IsValidCardNumber(number)) { /*Do something to say details invalid, but not throw exception, possibly?*/ } Number = number; CVC = cvc; IssueDate = issueDate ExpiryDate = expiryDate; } private bool IsValidCardNumber(string number) { return Regex.IsMatch(/*regex for card number*/); }} public void CreateProfile(CreateProfileCommand command){ var paymentInformation = new CardDetail(command.CardNumber, command.CardCVC, command.CardIssueDate, command.CardExpiryDate) var errors = /* list of errors added to from card detail validation, possibly? */ var profile = new UserProfile(/* pass args, add to errors? */ if(errors.Any()) { command.Results.Add(errors.Select(x => new CommandResult { Severity = Severity.Error, Message = x.Message }); return; } /* no errors, so continue to save */}",DDD validation without throwing exceptions

Alternative way to check if CTRL+ALT+DELETE screen is visible," Currently I'm using the below code to test if the CTRL+ALT+DEL screen is visible and it is working as expected. The problem is that polling this info consumes CPU and I'm looking for an event based option. Does anyone know another way to detect if this screen is visible?I only need to know when this screen is closed. I don't really care when it opens. Just that it had been open and is now closed.To be honest, I found this code and I'm not exactly sure how it is specific, if at all, to the screen I'm referring to. It appears to look for any process creation and deletion events. What this means is that this screen must be opening a new process. Knowing that process name would be helpful too. What is the name of this screen? And how do I detect this type of window? It seems like the same type as the login window. <code>  var interval = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 3);const string isWin32Process = ""TargetInstance isa \""Win32_Process\"""";// Listen for started processes.WqlEventQuery startQuery = new WqlEventQuery(""__InstanceCreationEvent"", interval, isWin32Process);var _startWatcher = new ManagementEventWatcher(startQuery);_startWatcher.Start();_startWatcher.EventArrived += OnStartEventArrived;// Listen for closed processes.WqlEventQuery stopQuery = new WqlEventQuery(""__InstanceDeletionEvent"", interval, isWin32Process);var _stopWatcher = new ManagementEventWatcher(stopQuery);_stopWatcher.Start();_stopWatcher.EventArrived += OnStopEventArrived;",Alternative way to check if CTRL+ALT+DEL screen is visible
Guid.NewGuId(); behind the scenes in .NET Core," Researching the subject yesterday, I found several interesting questions (such as this one) on how GUIDs are ultimately generated. In brief; it seems that Guid.NewGuid(); calls CoCreateGuid in the COM, which in turn calls UuidCreate in the Windows RPC (docs here and here).I found myself wondering; How does this work when the OS is not Windows, such as might be the case with .NET Core, and does this affect the 'version' algorithm used to generate the GUID (which I understand is Version 4 on Windows)? <code> ",Guid.NewGuid(); behind the scenes in .NET Core
Cannot instantiate implementation type for service type with generics," In an ASP.NET Core 1.1.2 web project, which depends on Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection 1.1.1, I'm trying to register a generic FluentValidation validator both with its implementation and with its interface. At runtime, during host building, I got following exception: This is the (generic, non-abstract) validator class: (not sure is important to show WithUser<T> class, it just holds a Guid UserId and a T Content).Registration happens like so: and at runtime those variables hold: which seems correct.I've looked around for similar problems and questions on SO as well, but they're not really related, as they were about generic implementation, while this is a concrete one.I've stepped through DependencyInjection module code, and exception is thrown here. For some reason, serviceTypeInfo.IsGenericTypeDefinition returns false (shouldn't that be true, as the interface type is generic?) and so the else-branch is taken. There, instead, the implementation type return true to implementationTypeInfo.IsGenericTypeDefinition, so there you have the exception.Runtime values are: While fiddling, I tried registering only the implementation, without also registering interface+implementation, and that exception goes away. But I'd like to inject the interface, if possible, not the implementation.What am I doing wrong?

C# Xml Serializer serializes list to count of 0 instead of null," I am confused on how XmlSerializer works behind the scenes. I have a class that deserializes XML into an object.

If someone could explain this to me it would be much appreciated. What I would prefer is that if <Tests> is missing from the XML then the list should remain null, but if a (possibly empty) node <Tests /> is present then the list should get allocated. <code>  [XmlRootAttribute(""MyClass"", Namespace = """", IsNullable = false)]public class MyClass{ private string comments; public string Comments { set { comments = value; } get { return comments; } } private System.Collections.Generic.List<string> tests = null; public System.Collections.Generic.List<string> Tests { get { return tests; } set { tests = value; } }} <MyClass> <SomeNode>value</SomeNode></MyClass>",C# Xml Serializer deserializes list to count of 0 instead of null

Performance issue using in memory database with Typscript/javascript," I have a server side developed in c# with entity framework as a provider for SQL server. My server is managing a many to many relation between students and classes. My client side is developed in angular js with Typscript.To be synchronized with the server, each change in server is pushed to the clients with push notifications (signalr).For faster response time, my client keeps a sort of database in memory (since the amount of data is not that big, less than 500 records). I keep an array of students and for each one of them also keep array of courses: And in that object I keep track of all the students and their courses in the client side.In my application I have the option to remove multiple courses from the entire system. However when doing such thing, when the action is successfully finished on server-side, the processing in the client side becomes heavy when there are many students. That is because I need to iterate through all the removed courses and for each one of them iterate through the entire students array to locate and remove those courses from the students array. (Or iterate the removed courses first and within iterate through the students) - both are heavy and take a while.Is there a different better design for this?

Is it possible to reassign a ref local in C#?," C#'s ref locals are implemented using a CLR feature called managed pointers, that come with their own set of restrictions, but luckily being immutable is not one of them. I.e. in ILAsm if you have a local variable of managed pointer type, it's entirely possible to change this pointer, making it ""reference"" another location. (C++/CLI also exposes this feature as interior pointers.)Reading the C# documentation on ref locals it appears to me that C#'s ref locals are, even though based on the managed pointers of CLR, not relocatable; if they are initialized to point to some variable, they cannot be made to point to something else. I've tried using and similar constructs, to no avail.I've even tried to write a small struct wrapping a managed pointer in IL, it works as far as C# is concerned, but the CLR doesn't seem to like having a managed pointer in a struct, even if in my usage it doesn't ever go to the heap.Does one really have to resort to using IL or tricks with recursion to overcome this? (I'm implementing a data structure that needs to keep track of which of its pointers were followed, a perfect use of managed pointers.) <code>  ref object reference = ref some_var;ref reference = ref other_var;",Is it possible to reassign a ref local?

AutoMapper - skip mapping null properties," I'm using AutoMapper to map a ViewModel to a Model. However, I want properties to not be mapped if the corresponding source property is null. My source class is as follows: And the destination class is: And here is how I configured the mapper: I thought that mapping would mean that properties don't get overwritten in the destination if the source one is null. But apparently I'm wrong: even when Source.Id is null, it still gets mapped, AutoMapper assigns it an empty Guid (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000), overwriting the existing one. How do I properly tell AutoMapper to skip mapping of a property if the source is null? NOTE: I don't think this is a problem with the Guid<->String conversion, such conversion works in automapper, I've used it in the pass. The problem is that it's not skipping the Id property when it is null. <code>  public class Source{ //Other fields... public string Id { get; set; } //This should not be mapped if null} public class Destination{ //Other fields... public Guid Id { get; set; }} Mapper.Initialize(cfg =>{ //Other mappings... cfg.CreateMap<Source, Destination>() .ForAllMembers(opts => opts.Condition((src, dest, srcMember) => srcMember != null));});",Skip mapping null properties

Ajax.BeginForm with 4 arguements not finding the action method," I have a weird case and I wanted your enlightenment.I have two controllers. One Person Controller for general Person use action methods and one Candidate Controller for more specific action methods related to Candidate. I use one partial view that is located under the Person folder in order to be used as generic in case I want to use it in the future for other types of Person.For the time being this partial view uses an Ajax.BeginForm targeting the Candidate Controller. The syntax I am using is This type of Ajax.BeginForm works correctly despite of the fact that it targets an action in a different controller.Now for my form validation I had to put some more arguments to my Ajax.BeginForm. My new syntax is like that: For some reason this way can't find the Action method. If I put my action inside the Person Controller it works correctly again. However I was wondering why is that case. I did some digging but I didn't manage to get an answer about that. From firebug I see that the url the browser tries to post is for some reason http://{ProjectName}/Person/SaveCandidateLanguage?Length=9 instead ofhttp://{ProjectName}/Candidate/SaveCandidateLanguage?Length=9and naturally I get a 404 Not found response. I was also wondering what is the variable ?Length=9 that I see at the end of the url and where does it come from. <code>  @using (Ajax.BeginForm(""SaveCandidateLanguage"", ""Candidate"", new AjaxOptions { HttpMethod = ""Post"", OnBegin = ""onBeginFormValidation"", OnSuccess = ""onSaveCandidateLanguageSuccess"" })){ // form input elements} @using (Ajax.BeginForm(""SaveCandidateLanguage"", ""Candidate"", new AjaxOptions { HttpMethod = ""Post"", OnBegin = ""onBeginFormValidation"", OnSuccess = ""onSaveCandidateLanguageSuccess"" }, new { id = ""addEditCandidateLanguageForm"", novalidate = ""novalidate"" })){ // form input elements}",Ajax.BeginForm with 4 arguments not finding the action method
Is there any case where `catch { throw; }` is actually useful?," Disclaimer: It is well known that catch (ex) { throw ex; } is bad practice. This question is not about that.While digging through Microsoft reference sources, I noticed the following pattern in a lot of methods: No logging, no debugging code—just a plain simple catch { throw; }.Since, obviously, the guys at Microsoft should be fairly proficient in the use of C#, what could be the point of doing that instead of just omitting the catch block (and the try statement) altogether? Is there a technical reason for coding like this, or is it purely a stylistic choice?Note: I don't know if it is relevant, but all such instances I could find also contain a try-finally block nested inside the try clause of the try-catch block. <code>  try { ...} catch { throw;}",Is there any technical reason to write a catch block containing only a throw statement?

Thread safe Singleton C#," I have read in Jon's Skeet online page about how to create a thread safe Singleton in C#http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/Singleton.aspx in the paragraph below this code it says: As hinted at before, the above is not thread-safe. Two different threads could both have evaluated the test if (instance==null) and found it to be true, then both create instances, which violates the singleton pattern. Note that in fact the instance may already have been created before the expression is evaluated, but the memory model doesn't guarantee that the new value of instance will be seen by other threads unless suitable memory barriers have been passed.Can you please explain why doesn't the memory model does not guarantee that the new value of instance will be seen by other threads?the static variable is located on the heap, but why it is not shared with other threads immediately? do we need to wait for the context switch so the other thread will know the instance is not null anymore? <code>  // Bad code!

Is it possible to dynamically compile class in App_Code while pre-compiling the rest a project/library," ASP.NET has specicial application folders like App_Code which: Contains source code for shared classes and business objects (for example, ..cs, and .vb files) that you want to compile as part of your application.

However, in that case, it's not available at design time. If I set the build action to compile - I can access the objects the same as any other compiled class during design/runtime, but it'll get stripped out of the /App_Code folder when published. I can still place it in the output directory via Copy Always, but the already compiled classes seem to take priority so I can't push config changes without re-deploying the whole application. <code>  namespace AppName.Globals{ public static class Messages { public const string CodeNotFound = ""The entered code was not found""; }} string msg = AppName.Globals.Messages.CodeNotFound;",Dynamically compile a class in App_Code while pre-compiling the rest of the project/library

But I'd love to be able to store config values directly in C#, rather than serve via an XML and have to read in during Application_Start and store in HttpContext.Current.ApplicationSo I have the following code in /App_Code/Globals.cs: Which could be anywhere within the application like this: The goal is to be able to store any literals in a configurable area that can be updated without recompiling the entire application.I can use the .cs file by setting its build action to compile, but doing so strips out App_Code/Globals.cs from my output.Q: Is there a way to identify some parts of a project that should dynamically compile while allowing the rest of the project to be precompiled?If I set the build action to content - the .cs file will get copied to the bin folder and compiled at runtime. However, in that case, it's not available at design time. If I set the build action to compile - I can access the objects the same as any other compiled class during design/runtime, but it'll get stripped out of the /App_Code folder when published. I can still place it in the output directory via Copy Always, but the already compiled classes seem to take priority so I can't push config changes without re-deploying the whole application. <code>  namespace AppName.Globals{ public static class Messages { public const string CodeNotFound = ""The entered code was not found""; }} string msg = AppName.Globals.Messages.CodeNotFound;",Dynamically compile a class in App_Code while pre-compiling the rest of the project/library
Is it really possible to protect a connectionstring in app. config?," We want to protect the login information that is used to connect to our SQL Server database from a .NET windows application.This information is stored as a connection string in an app.config file on the client PC.Almost everywhere it is suggested you encrypt your connection string using However, a malicious user that wants your database password, could just copy the encrypted config file, use it with it's own application, and call This will decrypt the connection string back to plain text.Is there any way to really protect a database password in a .NET application that is stored on a user's PC?EDIT: to further clarify the situation, we are indeed talking about a malicious user (read: competitor) that has access to the same PC and wants the password.As a secondary measure, we first encrypt the password ourselves, save it to app.config and then call ProtectSection(). This will make Unprotect() output the encrypted password.

C# WebClient.CancelAsync - File still downloading," I'm trying to create a Web API using Asp.NET Core that exposes routes to start and cancel long downloads of large files. The server should be able to handle multiple downloads at the same time.The download is performed using WebClient.DownloadFileAsync in order to have a short response time and returning a downloadId for later use. The instance of the WebClient is stored as value in a static dictionary whose corresponding key is of naturally the downloadId.The download should be canceled using WebClient.CancelAsync on the instance of the client retrieved by accessing the value of the dictionary corresponding to the downloadId key.The following code works perfectly when the download reaches its completion without being canceled; the AsyncCompletedEventHandler (OnDownloadFileCompleted in that case) is properly invoked. PROBLEM: When invoking WebClient.CancelAsync, the file keeps on downloading and OnDownloadFileCompleted is not invoked right away. The WebClient seems to wait until the download finishes before invoking the handler. In both case however, the property AsyncCompletedEventArgs.Canceled is properly set (e.g to true if WebClient.CancelAsync was indeed invoked.Am I missing something?Is there a better/smarter pattern to handle multiple downloads in a WebAPI?Any help would much appreciated!DownloadController.cs DownloadService.cs <code>  [Route (""api/download"")]public class DownloadController { private readonly DownloadService service; public DownloadController (DownloadService service) { this.service = service; } [Route (""start"")] [HttpPost] public string Start ([FromForm] string fileUrl) => this.service.StartDownload (fileUrl); [Route (""cancel"")] [HttpPost] public void Cancel ([FromForm] string downloadId) => this.service.CancelDownload (downloadId);} public class DownloadService { public string DOWNLOAD_FOLDER { get => ""C:\\tmp""; } public static Dictionary<string, WebClient> DownloadClients = new Dictionary<string, WebClient> (); public string StartDownload (string fileUrl) { var downloadId = Guid.NewGuid ().ToString (""N""); DownloadClients[downloadId] = new WebClient (); DownloadClients[downloadId].DownloadFileCompleted += OnDownloadFileCompleted; DownloadClients[downloadId].DownloadFileAsync (new Uri (fileUrl), Path.Combine (DOWNLOAD_FOLDER, downloadId), downloadId); return downloadId; } public void CancelDownload (string downloadId) { if (DownloadClients.TryGetValue (downloadId, out WebClient client)) { client.CancelAsync (); } } private void OnDownloadFileCompleted (object sender, AsyncCompletedEventArgs e) { var downloadId = e.UserState.ToString (); if (!e.Cancelled) { Debug.WriteLine (""Completed""); } else { Debug.WriteLine (""Cancelled""); //will only be reached when the file finishes downloading } if (DownloadClients.ContainsKey (downloadId)) { DownloadClients[downloadId].Dispose (); DownloadClients.Remove (downloadId); } }}",WebClient.CancelAsync  File still downloading

Odd behavior when naming a MonoBehaviour class GameManager," Is there something special about the name GameManager in Unity that causes the designer to act differently? I have a class named GameManager that is derived from ScriptableObject, and the designer is doing a few things differently for that class versus my other ScriptableObject derived classes.I can verify this behavior by changing the name from GameManager to Manager, and the Unity editor acts differently.My definition of GameManager looks like this: Here's what the Project view looks like when my C# class is named GameManager. Notice the different icon next to Game Manager. If I delete that asset, change the underlying C# class name to Manager, and then create the asset again, the icon is the normal icon, rather than being the gear.The other issue, which is more of a problem, is that if I have a game object that includes a MonoBehaviour that has a property of type GameManager, Unity won't show me the existing GameManager asset when I click on the little circle icon next to the field in the Inspector. Unity will let me drag the GameManager asset from the Project view into the field, but Unity won't let me select the reference by clicking in the field. As shown in the screenshots below, Unity doesn't give me the option of selecting my GameManager asset, even though it's available in the Project view.However, If I change the name of the underlying C# class from GameManager to Manager, the Unity editor works correctly, as shown below.Is there something special about the C# class name of GameManager, or could this behavior be due to something else? <code>  [CreateAssetMenu(menuName = ""Managers/GameManager"")]public class GameManager : ScriptableObject{ // ...}",Special Icon when naming a MonoBehaviour class GameManager

Does Database.CompatibleWithModel(bool) exist in EF Core," I'm working on a project that uses EFCore 2.1.0-preview1-final code first approach. Like in EF6 (and previous versions) I want to ensure the compatibility of my DbContext (and models) to the database.In EF6 it was enabled by default and it was possible to deactivate it with Database.CompatibleWithModel(false);. As far as I know EF uses the __MigrationHistory table where the model information was stored. EFCore has no such column in __EFMigrationsHistory table that could provide such information.I cannot find any information about compatibility check in EFCore. But I want to ensure the compatibility, because after some tests it seems not to be enabled by default (or does exist). I tested it by adding and deleting some columns from database manually and executing the application after the modifications. I - against my expectation - received no exception.Does anybody know how to achieve a compatibility check from model to database and vice versa like in EF6 for EFCore?Or could provide some helpful links for further information about it or why it doesn't exist in EFCore (because it is not necessary)? <code> ",Does an equivalent to Database.CompatibleWithModel(bool) exist in EF Core

Previous versions of the Object Library are incompatible with the 2016 version of office.If I use Excel's VBA editor, 'Microsoft Outlook 16.0 Object Library' is listed, and exists in C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.Office.Desktop_16010.9126.2116.0_x86_8wekyb3d8bbwe\VFS\ProgramFilesCommonX86\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE16\MSOUTL.OLB, as you can see below:However, when I use Visual Studio, the COM tab does not list 'Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library', and when I try to browse to C:\Program Files\WindowsApps, i get 'You dont currently have permission to access this folder', and clicking 'Continue' (to get access) results in 'You have been denied permission to access this folder'.So basically, the Office 2016 dlls seem to have been tucked away in a folder that is inaccessible to man, dog, and local administrator.All I'm trying to do is connect to the open Outlook application, and then send an email with an attachment, so perhaps another question to ask is, is there some new fangled way to communicate with Outlook 2016 that hasn't cropped up in my Googleathon?Also worth noting is that my version of office is installed as a 'Windows Store Application' and therefore does not appear on the usual Add/Remove programs list, so I can't find any 'repair' options for the installation.Thanks.Further investigation reveals that I am doing the right thing - trying to add a COM reference to 'Microsoft Outlook 16.0 Object Library' is now the correct way to target Outlook ... https://stackoverflow.com/a/21018418/5040941.I've checked the GAC, and the assemblies aren't registered. I've done a repair via the 'Apps and Features' right-click start menu option, and they still aren't appearing - it's as if the Windows Store apps just shove their dlls into the Program Files\WindowsApps\* folder, and don't bother to register them in the GAC.In answer to the much appreciated comments!Using the following code If I use the nuget Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook package, i get a System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: 'Invalid class string (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800401F3 (CO_E_CLASSSTRING))' exception.If I try using Microsoft Outlook 15.0 Object Library or Microsoft Outlook 14.0 Object Library references via the Assemblies/Extensions tab of Add Reference, I get a System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: 'Invalid class string (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800401F3 (CO_E_CLASSSTRING))' exception.I don't think accessing the WindowsApps folder is the way to go.Firstly, it's locked down for some reason which typically indicates the potential for trouble if i start digging around and changing security permissions, not to mention the fact that maintaining a copy of the latest dll in my solution will undoubtedly add unnecessary complexity to my project.Secondly, but more importantly, if I have office installed, and I can access 'Microsoft Outlook 16.0 Object Library' from Excel Vba, then why can't I access it from Visual Studio?There is obviously some issue with the installation not registering the dlls properly, only Excel has some trick it uses to make the reference available anyway.Has anyone reading this managed to install Office 365/2016 Windows Store and found a reference to 'Microsoft Outlook 16.0 Object Library' in Visual Studio?Am I the only with this problem?!

Why is a generic type constrained by 'Enum' failing to qualify as a 'struct'?," If I have a generic interface with a struct constraint like this: I can supply an enumeration as my type T like so, because an enum satisfies a struct constraint: C# 7.3 added an Enum constraint. The following code, which was previously illegal, now compiles: However, to my surprise, the following fails to compile: ...with the error CS0453 The type 'T' must be a non-nullable value type in order to use it as parameter 'T' in the generic type or method 'IStruct'Why is this? I would expect a generic type constrained by Enum to be usable as a type argument where the type is constrained by struct but this doesn't seem to be the case - I am having to change my Enum constraint to struct, Enum. Is my expectation wrong? <code>  public interface IStruct<T> where T : struct { } public class EnumIsAStruct : IStruct<DateTimeKind> { } public class MCVE<T> : IStruct<T> where T : struct, Enum { } public class MCVE<T> : IStruct<T> where T : Enum { }",Why is a generic type constrained by 'Enum' failing to qualify as a 'struct' in C# 7.3?

Winforms tree view checking/unchecking," The following code is intended to recursively check or un-check parent or child nodes as required.For instance, at this position, A, G, L, and T nodes must be unchecked if we un-check any one of them.The problem with the following code is, whenever I double-click any node the algorithm fails to achieve its purpose.The tree-searching algorithm starts here: Driver Program Expected to happen:Take a look at the screenshot of the application. A, G, L, and T are checked. If I uncheck, say, L, - T should be unchecked as T is a child of L. - G and A should be unchecked as they will have no children left.What is happening:This application code works fine if I single-click any node. If I double-click a node, that node becomes checked/unchecked but the same change is not reflected on the parent and children. Double-click also freezes the application for a while.How can I fix this issue and obtain the expected behavior? <code>  // stack is used to traverse the tree iteratively.

Is querying deserialized YAML in C# with a `jq`-like syntax possible?," I need to work with YAML generated by Kubernetes and I'd like to be able to read specific properties with an XPath-like or jq-like DSL notation in C#.The structure and nature of the YAML that Kubernetes generates is well-defined in most places, but in some cases is arbitrary and comes from user input, so it's not possible to define static types up front that can capture the entire structure of the YAML.The most popular solution for deserializing and reading YAML in C# seems to be YamlDotNet, but it's mostly geared towards deserializing into fully-typed objects.I'd rather not have to define a bunch of static types or do a lot of cumbersome casting just to get one or two fields or aggregate across them. My ideal approach would instead be something like: Is this possible with YamlDotNet or another similar and well-supported tool in C#?Update: I tried a number of approaches, but in the end, the one that worked best was reserializing to JSON and then querying with Json.NET, which has better support. <code>  var reader = new FileReader(""my-file.yaml"");List<string> listOfPodNames = Yaml.Deserialize(reader) .Query("".pods[*].name"") .AsList;// expected result: list of all pod names as strings","With C#, is querying YAML possible without defining lots of types?"

How to check if statements dynamically from database," My questions as follows, I need to check conditions through the database. which means in the simple application we check if conditions like this. Suppose, Client, needs to change the condition dynamically, which means he need to add additional condition to the system like,if 31 <= age && age <= 40 => Range 31 - 40When doing this in the client side, sometimes wrong conditions can be added to the system like, (4 <= age && age <= 15) this condition cannot be added, because the system already have condition (5 <= age && age <= 10).

Long running CPU-bound synchronous implementation of an interface that returns a Task," I'm using this question as a basis for my question.TL;DR: If you're not supposed to wrap synchronous code in an async wrapper, how do you deal with long-running, thread-blocking methods that implement an interface method which expects an asynchronous implementation? Let's say I have an application that runs continuously to process a work queue. It's a server-side application (running mostly unattended) but it has a UI client to give a more-fine-grained control over the behavior of the application as required by the business processes: start, stop, tweak parameters during execution, get progress, etc.There's a business logic layer into which services are injected as dependencies.The BLL defines a set of interfaces for those services.I want to keep the client responsive: allow UI client to interact with the running process, and I also want threads to be used efficiently because the process needs to be scalable: there could be any number of asynchronous database or disk operations depending on the work in the queue. Thus I'm employing async/await ""all the way"".To that end, I have methods in the service interfaces that are obviously designed to encourage async/await and support for cancellation because they take a CancellationToken, are named with ""Async"", and return Tasks.I have a data repository service that performs CRUD operations to persist my domain entities. Let's say that at the present time, I'm using an API for this that doesn't natively support async. In the future, I may replace this with one that does, but for the time being the data repository service performs the majority of its operations synchronously, many of them long-running operations (because the API blocks on the database IO).Now, I understand that methods returning Tasks can run synchronously. The methods in my service class that implement the interfaces in my BLL will run synchronously as I explained, but the consumer (my BLL, client, etc) will assume they are either 1: running asynchronously or 2: running synchronously for a very short time. What the methods shouldn't do is wrap synchronous code inside an async call to Task.Run.I know I could define both sync and async methods in the interface.In this case I don't want to do that because of the async ""all the way"" semantics I'm trying to employ and because I'm not writing an API to be consumed by a customer; as mentioned above, I don't want to change my BLL code later from using the sync version to using the async version.Here's the data service interface: And it's implementation: The BLL: Presentation and presentation logic: So the question is: how do you deal with long-running, blocking methods that implement an interface method which expects an asynchronous implementation? Is this an example where it's preferable to break the ""no async wrapper for sync code"" rule? <code>  public interface IDataRepository{ Task<IReadOnlyCollection<Widget>> GetAllWidgetsAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken);} public sealed class DataRepository : IDataRepository{ public Task<IReadOnlyCollection<Widget>> GetAllWidgetsAsync( CancellationToken cancellationToken) { /******* The idea is that this will /******* all be replaced hopefully soon by an ORM tool. */ var ret = new List<Widget>(); // use synchronous API to load records from DB var ds = Api.GetSqlServerDataSet( ""SELECT ID, Name, Description FROM Widgets"", DataResources.ConnectionString); foreach (DataRow row in ds.Tables[0].Rows) { cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); // build a widget for the row, add to return. } // simulate long-running CPU-bound operation. DateTime start = DateTime.Now; while (DateTime.Now.Subtract(start).TotalSeconds < 10) { } return Task.FromResult((IReadOnlyCollection<Widget>) ret.AsReadOnly()); }} public sealed class WorkRunner{ private readonly IDataRepository _dataRepository; public WorkRunner(IDataRepository dataRepository) => _dataRepository = dataRepository; public async Task RunAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) { var allWidgets = await _dataRepository .GetAllWidgetsAsync(cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false); // I'm using Task.Run here because I want this on // another thread even if the above runs synchronously. await Task.Run(async () => { while (true) { cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); foreach (var widget in allWidgets) { /* do something */ } await Task.Delay(2000, cancellationToken); // wait some arbitrary time. } }).ConfigureAwait(false); }} private async void HandleStartStopButtonClick(object sender, EventArgs e){ if (!_isRunning) { await DoStart(); } else { DoStop(); }}private async Task DoStart(){ _isRunning = true; var runner = new WorkRunner(_dependencyContainer.Resolve<IDataRepository>()); _cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource(); try { _startStopButton.Text = ""Stop""; _resultsTextBox.Clear(); await runner.RunAsync(_cancellationTokenSource.Token); // set results info in UI (invoking on UI thread). } catch (OperationCanceledException) { _resultsTextBox.Text = ""Canceled early.""; } catch (Exception ex) { _resultsTextBox.Text = ex.ToString(); } finally { _startStopButton.Text = ""Start""; }}private void DoStop(){ _cancellationTokenSource.Cancel(); _isRunning = false;}",Long running synchronous implementation of an interface that returns a Task
EF Core 2.1 seed with HasData() from external source (such as json file) without deleting and re-inserting," Update 8/29/18Seeing this issue in inline new-ing of seed data as well. Opened an EF Core issue. Will update the question with any findings.I am trying to use EF Core 2.1's seeding mechanism. However, I want to load the seed data from json flat files rather than hard-coding new C# objects. I wrote the extension method below, which worked well for the initial migration. It looks for files named [MyEntity].json in DataPath and deserializes them into objects.The problem is that if I add a subsequent migration, even without changing a single thing in the models, configurations, or json files, the new migration deletes every single entity and re-inserts them again. So, the Up() contains a bunch of deletes followed by a bunch of inserts of the same data. I suspect this is because EF Core is not smart enough to recognize that it is an identical set of seed data.Question:Is there a way to use EF Core 2.1 seeding with an external data source (such as json files) without having each migration delete and re-insert the data?My seeding extension method: <code>  public static class ModelBuilderExtensions{ public static string DataPath { private get; set; } = ""..\\..\\data""; public static void Seed<TEntity>(this ModelBuilder modelBuilder) where TEntity : class, IBaseEntity { var entities = GetSeedRows<TEntity>(); modelBuilder.Entity<TEntity>().HasData(entities); } private static TEntity[] GetSeedRows<TEntity>() where TEntity : IBaseEntity { try { return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<TEntity[]>( File.ReadAllText(DataPath + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar + typeof(TEntity).Name + "".json"")); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); return null; } }}",EF Core 2.1 HasData() creating deletes and re-inserts for unchanged entities on subsequent migrations

WPF: Animation that reverse UI element to its default state is too slow," Let's imagine we have an animation that changes a Rectangle's width from 50 to 150 when user moves the cursor over it and back from 150 to 50 when user moves the cursor away. Let the duration of each animation be 1 second.Everything is OK if user moves the cursor over the rectangle, then waits for 1 second for animation to finish, and then moves the cursor away from the rectangle. Two animations take 2 seconds totally and their speed is exactly what we are expecting to be.But if user moves the cursor away before the first animation (50 -> 150) is finished, the second animation's duration will be 1 second but the speed of it will be very slow. I mean, the second animation will animate the rectangle's width not from 150 to 50 but from let's say 120 to 50 or from 70 to 50 if you take cursor away very fast. But for the same 1 second!So what I want to understand is how to make the duration of the ""backwards"" animation to be dynamic. Dynamic based on at what point the first animation was stopped. Or, if I specify From and To values to 150 and 50, Duration to 1 seconds and rectangle width will be 100 WPF would calculate by itself that animation is 50% done.I was testing different ways to use animation like Triggers, EventTrigger in style, and VisualStateGroups but no success.Here is a XAML sample that shows my problem. If you want to see by yourself what I am talking about, move the cursor over the rectangle, wait for 1-2 seconds (first animation is finished) then move the cursor away. After that, move the cursor over the rectangle for like 0.25 seconds and move it away. You will see that the rectangle's width changes very slowly. Also, I would like to explain what calculation I am expecting to see.So let's imagine another animation that goes from 100 to 1100 and has a duration of 2 seconds. If we stop it at the point of 300, it must start to go back to 100 but not for 2 seconds but for: If we stop at 900, duration will be: And if we let animation finish normally it will be: <code>  <Rectangle Width=""50"" Height=""100"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" Fill=""Black""><Rectangle.Triggers> <EventTrigger RoutedEvent=""MouseEnter""> <BeginStoryboard> <Storyboard> <DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetProperty=""Width"" To=""150"" Duration=""0:0:1"" /> </Storyboard> </BeginStoryboard> </EventTrigger> <EventTrigger RoutedEvent=""MouseLeave""> <BeginStoryboard> <Storyboard> <DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetProperty=""Width"" /> </Storyboard> </BeginStoryboard> </EventTrigger></Rectangle.Triggers> ((300 - 100) / (1100 - 100)) * 2s = 0.4s ((900 - 100) / (1100 - 100)) * 2s = 1.6s ((1100 - 100) / (1100 - 100)) * 2s = 2s",How to make the duration of an animation dynamic?
How to make the duration of an animation dynamic?," Let's imagine we have an animation that changes a Rectangle's width from 50 to 150 when user moves the cursor over it and back from 150 to 50 when user moves the cursor away. Let the duration of each animation be 1 second.Everything is OK if user moves the cursor over the rectangle, then waits for 1 second for animation to finish, and then moves the cursor away from the rectangle. Two animations take 2 seconds totally and their speed is exactly what we are expecting to be.But if user moves the cursor away before the first animation (50 -> 150) is finished, the second animation's duration will be 1 second but the speed of it will be very slow. I mean, the second animation will animate the rectangle's width not from 150 to 50 but from let's say 120 to 50 or from 70 to 50 if you take cursor away very fast. But for the same 1 second!So what I want to understand is how to make the duration of the ""backwards"" animation to be dynamic. Dynamic based on at what point the first animation was stopped. Or, if I specify From and To values to 150 and 50, Duration to 1 seconds and rectangle width will be 100 WPF would calculate by itself that animation is 50% done.I was testing different ways to use animation like Triggers, EventTrigger in style, and VisualStateGroups but no success.Here is a XAML sample that shows my problem. If you want to see by yourself what I am talking about, move the cursor over the rectangle, wait for 1-2 seconds (first animation is finished) then move the cursor away. After that, move the cursor over the rectangle for like 0.25 seconds and move it away. You will see that the rectangle's width changes very slowly. Also, I would like to explain what calculation I am expecting to see.So let's imagine another animation that goes from 100 to 1100 and has a duration of 2 seconds. If we stop it at the point of 300, it must start to go back to 100 but not for 2 seconds but for: If we stop at 900, duration will be: And if we let animation finish normally it will be: <code>  <Rectangle Width=""50"" Height=""100"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" Fill=""Black""><Rectangle.Triggers> <EventTrigger RoutedEvent=""MouseEnter""> <BeginStoryboard> <Storyboard> <DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetProperty=""Width"" To=""150"" Duration=""0:0:1"" /> </Storyboard> </BeginStoryboard> </EventTrigger> <EventTrigger RoutedEvent=""MouseLeave""> <BeginStoryboard> <Storyboard> <DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetProperty=""Width"" /> </Storyboard> </BeginStoryboard> </EventTrigger></Rectangle.Triggers> ((300 - 100) / (1100 - 100)) * 2s = 0.4s ((900 - 100) / (1100 - 100)) * 2s = 1.6s ((1100 - 100) / (1100 - 100)) * 2s = 2s",How to make the duration of an animation dynamic?

C# Improve performance of Bitconverter.ToInt16," I am collecting data from a USB device and this data has to go to an audio output component. At the moment I am not delivering the data fast enough to avoid clicks in the output signal. So every millisecond counts.At the moment I am collecting the data which is delivered in a byte array of 65536 bytes.The first two bytes represent 16 bits of data in little endian format. These two bytes must be placed in the first element of a double array. The second two bytes, must be placed in the first element of a different double array.

It takes around 0.3ms to run this but it has to be done 10 times to get a packet to send off to the audio output.

I thought it might be that I need to keep a reference to the DataContext (ServiceCustomContext) although that seemed counter intuitive, but even the Microsoft examples don't do that.

Example; Calling Main() gives; I'd expect; Why do both bool and Nullable<bool> match each other?What have I tried;I've consulted the docs for Nullable, is, switch and pattern matching.I think this might be related to unboxing of the value when it's passed into the method?I think it might be unique to Nullable because I don't run into the same problems for other generic types. For example; Gives; I'm not looking to solve a problem. Just interested as to why it works this way.Answers so far suggest it's implicit and explicit conversions that cause this behaviour but I haven't been able to replicate with the following example; Gives; The docs for is say: It only considers reference conversions, boxing conversions, and unboxing conversions; it does not consider user-defined conversions or conversions defined by a type's implicit and explicit operators. The following example generates warnings because the result of the conversion is known at compile-time.

Run script based on sound level in vb.net," I'm designing an application to farm one of my games for me. However, The approach I'm going with is to listen for a sound or spike in sound levels before running a desired macro combination. The audio I'm looking to monitor is the current PC's audio output, not a microphone or external device.This subject seem's to be vary vague on tutorials or information, however from my knowledge I found a post here that explains to use a BuckSoft.DirectSound project?So based on the information I found, I assume you do something like the following? From personal prospective I would love to help clarify a solution to the public as this topic is not well documented and avoided. I'm open to all solutions or suggestions, however, my focus is on vb.net and will consider C# if needed.Another option that I have seen is the CoreAudio API. I have seen this API used on multiple posts for the ability to extract the current sound levels, however I have not seen examples for reading the current Master VU meter and fader data/Levels. Data I'm looking to gather:As showed bellow, I'm NOT looking to gather the physical sound level % but rather looking to run actions if the VU levels spike from 0. This means if I play a video or sound file, the application will hear a sound coming from the current work station and perform a desired action.Bellow will be my rough example of how I plan to use or collect data from my prospective. Using an timer within vb.net I can have an statement consistently looking for an change in ""VUSoundLevels"" (Not a real statement) and run a script when an change/input happens. <code>  If AnalogSignalMeter1.LeftLevel > 0 Or AnalogSignalMeter1.RightLevel > 0 Then ' Do SomethingEnd If Private Function GetVol() As Integer 'Function to read current volume setting Dim MasterMinimum As Integer = 0 Dim DevEnum As New MMDeviceEnumerator() Dim device As MMDevice = DevEnum.GetDefaultAudioEndpoint(EDataFlow.eRender, ERole.eMultimedia) Dim Vol As Integer = 0 With device.AudioEndpointVolume Vol = CInt(.MasterVolumeLevelScalar * 100) If Vol < MasterMinimum Then Vol = MasterMinimum / 100.0F End If End With Return VolEnd Function Private Sub Timer1_Tick() If VUSoundLevels > 0 Then ' Run Code & Exit Loop End IFEnd Sub",Run script based on sound VU level in vb.net

is-operator causes unneccessary boxing?," The documentation of constant pattern matching with the is-operator (expr is constant) states:The constant expression is evaluated as follows:If expr and constant are integral types, the C# equality operator determines whether the expression returns true (that is, whether expr == constant).Otherwise, the value of the expression is determined by a call to the static Object.Equals(expr, constant) method.Therefore, when using this code I expect it to use the == operator (case 1) and generate this code: However, in reality, the integer parameter and the constant (literal) are boxed in order to be passed to the static Object.Equals method (case 2): Why is that the case? <code>  public bool IsZero(int value){ return value is 0;} .method public hidebysig instance bool IsZero( int32 'value' ) cil managed{ .maxstack 8 ldarg.1 ldc.i4.0 ceq ret} .method public hidebysig instance bool IsZero( int32 'value' ) cil managed{ .maxstack 8 ldc.i4.0 box [mscorlib]System.Int32 ldarg.1 box [mscorlib]System.Int32 call bool [mscorlib]System.Object::Equals(object, object) ret}",Why does the is-operator cause unnecessary boxing?

Rounding of last digit changes after Windows update," After Windows has updated, some calculated values have changed in the last digit, e.g. from -0.0776529085243926 to -0.0776529085243925. The change is always down by one and both even and odd numbers are affected. This seems to be related to KB4486153, as reverting this update changes the values back to the previous ones.This change can be seen already when debugging in Visual Studio and hovering over the variable.

Do multiple instances of System.Random still use the same seed?," I've seen several articles talking about not generating too many System.Random instances too closely together because they'll be seeded with the same value from the system clock and thus return the same set of numbers:https://stackoverflow.com/a/2706537/2891835https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2009/11/04/revisiting-randomness/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=netframework-4.8#instantiating-the-random-number-generatorThat appears to be true for .net framework 4.8.Looking at the source code for .net core, however, it looks like instances of System.Random generated on the same thread are seeded from a [ThreadStatic] generator.So it would seem to me that, in .net core, you are now safe to do something like: Is this true? Am I missing something?Note: Assume we're talking about a single thread here (although I'm not sure it matters because it looks like .net core uses bcrypt or something to seed the global generator per-thread?).EDIT:This is now tracked in this ticket. <code>  Random[] randoms = new Random[1000];for (int i = 0; i < randoms.Length; i++){ randoms[i] = new Random();}// use Random instances and they'll all have distinct generated patterns",Do multiple instances of System.Random still use the same seed in .Net Core?

How is this c# dictionary initialization correct?," I stumbled upon the following and I'm wondering why it didn't raise a syntax error. Notice that the "","" is missing between the ""MyA"", and ""OtherAs"".This is where the confusion happens:The code compiles.The final dictionary ""dict"" contains only three elements: ""Id"", ""Tribes"", and ""MyA"".The value for all except ""MyA"" are correct,""MyA"" takes the declared value for ""OtherAs"", while its original value is ignored.Why isn't this illegal?

Better way to add spaces between double semicolons in C#," My task is simple: I have a CSV file inside a C# string, split with semicolons. I need to add spaces for each empty cell. A;B;;;;C; should become A;B; ; ; ;C;. Right now, I'm using the replace method twice: That's necessary, because in the first pass, it will replace any occurance of ;; with a space between, but there's no lookback, so the second semicolon of the replaced sequence won't be checked again. Therefore I would end up with a A;B; ;; ;C;, which is not what I want.Is there a more elegant, clear, and less redundand way to solve that task? <code>  csv = csv.Replace("";;"", ""; ;"").Replace("";;"", ""; ;"");",Better way to add spaces between double semicolons

Visual Studio does not show all errors in the code," I've been using Visual Studio (2017) for quite a long time now, to program mostly in C#, for Unity games. Recently though, I noticed that it was not displaying any errors in the code anymore, or at least most of them. I initially started making some small tests, for example removing variables that were being used multiple times in the scripts. Visual Studio was not showing any errors, while when going back to Unity, it was showing all the correct errors in the console (as always). Instead, if I tried to remove a parenthese, it was, after a bit, showing errors all over the place. Again, it was really strange.After one day, I was still testing, and I noticed that if I first opened Visual Studio, and then in ""recent"" I clicked on the the .sln file, that opened all the scripts for one Unity project, it was immediately showing all the right errors, like it had always done and how (I think) it should always do. I started looking for some differences between what I was seeing there, and what I was seeing when opening the .cs files (in the way that wasn't working):At the top, I wasn't seeing ""Debug"" and ""Any CPU"" how I was when it was working:Another thing was that, between the ""Project"" and the ""Debug"" buttons (at the top, that open the drop-down lists), I didn't have the ""Compile"" button.Also, under the the ""Debug"" drop-down many options like ""start debug"" were not available / disabled.At the top left, under the left-most script name, I have ""External files"" instead of ""Assembly-CSharp""At the right of where there should be ""Debug"" and ""Any CPU"", I have ""Connect"" instead of ""Start"" (Or something similar, my system's language is not english, these are translations)Another (maybe less relevant) thing that has changed from before, when it was working:I have installed Visual Studio 2019, and uninstalled after a few minutes (I've always preferred Visual Studio 2017!).Programming without seeing the errors realtime takes much more time, so I'd really like to fix this problem, if it is possible to do so. Is there anything that I have to activate? Did I accidentally press a combination of keys?Thanks in advance! :) <code> ",Visual Studio does not show errors in the code anymore

Best practices for managing JWT token inside a Web API," My Project:Web API project - ASP .NET Framework 4.8Problem?The code flow is as follows:1.) The API is called -> it must call another API -> 2.) Get JWT authentication token -> 3.) Calls the desired method.The problem is if my API is called 100 times, I will make 100 calls for the GetJwtToken() method and another 100 for the desired method itself, which seems like an overhead on the auth server. The token itself has a lifespan of 2 hours.Are there any documented best practices on how to manage a Web API JWT token in another Web API?What have I tried?I've tried the following solutions and I'm still not sure whether they could be considered good practices.One static class with two static properties Token and ValidTo and one static method GetJwtToken() that updates those properties. Before each call to the desired external API method, we check the ValidTo property and update the Token value if it has expired, via the static method.In our service, we have one static private field Token.The method that calls the external API method is surrounded by a try catch blocks. The Catch(WebException ex) expects an Unauthorized exception if the token has expired. I check for HTTP Status Code 401 - Unauthorized. In case we go into that if clause we update the Token property by calling the GetJwtToken() method inside the catch block and then calling recursively the method again. In this way, we update the token only when it has expired and an unauthorized exception was thrown.Another idea that I got, but didn't test isActionFilterAttribute with overridden OnActionExecuting(HttpActionContext actionContext) method. Before we go into the Web API controller the action attribute has already checked whether we have Token and if it has expired. The problem here was I am not sure where to save the Token property. Possibly as a static value in another class.Are there any other ways to manage a JWT Token of a Web API inside another Web API and what is considered best practices?Some code snippets, pseudo-code, or articles would be appreciated.Edit1:I've read this question, but it doesn't help me, since it's about how to manage the token on the front end part. The project here is Web API it's all on the server-side.Edit2:Edited some sentences here and there so it's more readable.Edit3:Added one more option that I thought about. <code>  if (response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)",Best practices for managing Web API JWT token in another Web API

Pass DateOnly query argument as string," As of .NET 6 in ASP.NET API, if you want to get DateOnly (or TimeOnly) as query parameter, you need to separately specify all it's fields instead of just providing a string (""2021-09-14"", or ""10:54:53"" for TimeOnly) like you can for DateTime.I was able to fix that if they are part of the body by adding adding custom JSON converter (AddJsonOptions(o => o.JsonSerializerOptions.Converters.Add(...))), but it doesn't work for query parameters.I know that could be fixed with model binder, but I don't want to create a model binder for every model that contains DateOnly/TimeOnly. Is there a way to fix this application wide?Demo:Lets assume you have a folowwing action:[HttpGet] public void Foo([FromQuery] DateOnly date, [FromQuery] TimeOnly time, [FromQuery] DateTime dateTime)Here's how it would be represented in Swagger:I want it represented as three string fields: one for DateOnly, one for TimeOnly and one for DateTime (this one is already present).PS: It's not a Swagger problem, it's ASP.NET one. If I try to pass ?date=2021-09-14 manually, ASP.NET wouldn't understand it. <code> ",How can I use DateOnly/TimeOnly query parameters in ASP.NET Core 6?

Can I tell Blazor to re-render specific HTML elements even if the property they depend on hasn't changed?," In Blazor, how can I undo invalid user input, without changing the state of the component to trigger a re-render?Here is a simple Blazor counter example (try it online): For input element A, I want to replicate the behavior of input element B, but without using the bind-xxx-style data binding attributes.E.g., when I type 123x inside A, I want it to revert back to 123 automatically, as it happens with B.I've tried StateHasChanged but it doesn't work, I suppose, because the count property doesn't actually change.So, basically I need to re-render A to undo invalid user input, even thought the state hasn't changed. How can I do that without the bind-xxx magic?Sure, bind-xxx is great, but there are cases when a non-standard behavior might be desired, built around a managed event handler like ChangeEvent.Updated, to compare, here's how I could have done it in React (try it online): Also, here's how I could have done it in Svelte, which I find conceptually very close to Blazor (try it online). Updated, to clarify, I simply want to undo whatever I consider an invalid input, retrospectively after it has happened, by handling the change event, without mutating the component's state itself (counter here).That is, without Blazor-specific two-way data binding, HTML native type=number or pattern matching attributes. I simply use the number format requirement here as an example; I want to be able to undo any arbitrary input like that.The user experience I want (done via a JS interop hack): https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wPbvcvvi128Qtzvu03Surprised this so difficult in Blazor compared to other frameworks, and that I'm unable to use StateHasChanged to simply force a re-render of the component in its current state. <code>  <label>Count:</label><button @onclick=Increment>@count times!</button><br>A: <input @oninput=OnChange value=""@count""><br>B: <input @bind-value=count @bind-value:event=""oninput"">@code { int count = 1; void Increment() => count++; void OnChange(ChangeEventArgs e) { var userValue = e.Value?.ToString(); if (int.TryParse(userValue, out var v)) { count = v; } else { if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(userValue)) { count = 0; } // if count hasn't changed here, // I want to re-render ""A"" // this doesn't work e.Value = count.ToString(); // this doesn't work either StateHasChanged(); } }} function App() { let [count, setCount] = useState(1); const handleClick = () => setCount((count) => count + 1); const handleChange = (e) => { const userValue = e.target.value; let newValue = userValue ? parseInt(userValue) : 0; if (isNaN(newValue)) newValue = count; // re-render even when count hasn't changed setCount(newValue); }; return ( <> Count: <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button><br/> A: <input value={count} onInput={handleChange}/><br/> </> );} <script> let count = 1; const handleClick = () => count++; const handleChange = e => { const userValue = e.target.value; let newValue = userValue? parseInt(userValue): 0; if (isNaN(newValue)) newValue = count; if (newValue === count) e.target.value = count; // undo user input else count = newValue; } }; </script>Count: <button on:click={handleClick}>{count}</button><br/>A: <input value={count} on:input={handleChange}/><br/>","In Blazor, is there a way to undo invalid user input, without changing the state?"
Entity Framework Core: strange behaviour when filtering on Include with AsNoTracking," I don't know if it is expected to be this way but I thought it is strange since changes the query results.When I execute the query below I get my entity with only 2 ""Mensagens"" entity because i'm filtering only the actives so it's right, I have 2 active entities on my database and 1 inactive. But if I execute the exact same command just removing the AsNoTracking() line it gives me the 3 records, both active and inactive.But the inactive one EF doesn't fetch the ThenInclude below. It changes the behaviour.With AsNoTracking it filters the data according to the filter I used on IncludeWithout AsNoTracking it bring me all the data but it filters if it will load or not the ThenInclude objects.Does anyone know if this is a normal behaviour and why does it behaves like this? <code>  return await context.Lancamentos .Include(x => x.UsuarioCriacao) .Include(x => x.Mensagens.Where(m => m.Ativo)) .ThenInclude(m => m.MensagemMedias) .ThenInclude(m => m.MediaWhatsapp) .ThenInclude(m => m.TipoMediaWhatsapp) .Include(x => x.Mensagens.Where(m => m.Ativo)) .ThenInclude(x => x.TemplateMensagem) .ThenInclude(t => t.Medias) .ThenInclude(m => m.MediaWhatsapp) .ThenInclude(m => m.TipoMediaWhatsapp) .AsNoTracking() .FirstOrDefaultAsync(l => l.Id == id && l.Ativo);",Strange behaviour when filtering on Include with AsNoTracking
