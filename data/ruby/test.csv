How do I marshall a lambda (Proc) in Ruby?," Joe Van Dyk asked the Ruby mailing list: Hi, In Ruby, I guess you can't marshal a lambda/proc object, right? Is that possible in lisp or other languages? What I was trying to do: So, I'm sending BackgroundJob a lambda object, which contains the context/code for what to do. But, guess that wasn't possible. I ended up marshaling a normal ruby object that contained instructions for what to do after the program ran.

Ruby - Convert File to String," I need an easy way to take a tar file and convert it into a string (and vice versa). Is there a way to do this in Ruby? My best attempt was this: I thought that would be enough to convert it to a string, but then when I try to write it back out like this... It isn't the same file. Doing ls -l shows the files are of different sizes, although they are pretty close (and opening the file reveals most of the contents intact). Is there a small mistake I'm making or an entirely different (but workable) way to accomplish this? <code>  file = File.open(""path-to-file.tar.gz"")contents = """"file.each {|line| contents << line} newFile = File.open(""test.tar.gz"", ""w"")newFile.write(contents)",Read binary file as string in Ruby

Markdown validation," It's possible to write Markdown content with invalid syntax. Invalid means that the BlueCloth library fails to parse the content and throws an exception. The markdown helper in Rails doesn't catch any BlueCloth exceptions and because of that the complete page fails to render (500 Server Error page is rendered instead).In my case, users are allowed to write Markdown content and save it to the database. If someone used invalid syntax, all successive rendering attempts of that content fail (Status Code 500 - Internal Server Error).How do you get around this issue?

What is the best way to extend restful_authentication to support lazy logins by a long auth key?," I'm building an iPhone application that talks to a Ruby on Rails backend. The Ruby on Rails application will also service web users. The restful_authentication plugin is an excellent way to provide quick and customizable user authentication. However, I would like users of the iPhone application to have an account created automatically by the phone's unique identifier ([[UIDevice device] uniqueIdentifier]) stored in a new column. Later, when users are ready to create a username/password, the account will be updated to contain the username and password, leaving the iPhone unique identifier intact. Users should not be able to access the website until they've setup their username/password. They can however, use the iPhone application, since the application can authenticate itself using it's identifier.What is the best way to modify restful_authentication to do this? Create a plugin? Or modify the generated code?What about alternative frameworks, such as AuthLogic. What is the best way to allow iPhones to get a generated auth token locked to their UUID's, but then let the user create a username/password later? <code> ",What is the best way to extend restful_authentication/AuthLogic to support lazy logins by an anonymous iPhone?

Getting Argument Names In Ruby Reflection," I would like to do some fairly heavy-duty reflection in Ruby. I want to create a function that returns the names of the arguments of various calling functions higher up the call stack (just one higher would be enough but why stop there?). I could use Kernel.caller, go to the file and parse the argument list but that would be ugly and unreliable. The function that I would like would work in the following way: I would not mind using ParseTree or some similar tool for this task but looking at Parsetree, it is not obvious how to use it for this purpose. Creating a C extension like this is another possibility but it would be nice if someone had already done it for me.I can see that I'll probably need some kind of C extension. I suppose that means my question is what combination of C extension would work most easily. I don't think caller+ParseTree would be enough by themselves. As far as why I would like to do this goes, rather than saying ""automatic debugging"", perhaps I should say that I would like to use this functionality to do automatic checking of the calling and return conditions of functions: Where check_positive would throw an exception if x and y weren't positive. Obviously, there would be more to it than that but hopefully this gives enough motivation. <code>  module A def method1( tuti, fruity) foo end def method2(bim, bam, boom) foo end def foo print caller_args[1].join("","") #the ""1"" mean one step up the call stack endendA.method1 #prints ""tuti,fruity""A.method2 #prints ""bim, bam, boom"" def add x, y check_positive return x + yend",How to get argument names using reflection

"What does Ruby have that Python doens't, and vice versa?"," There is a lot of discussions of Python vs Ruby, and I all find them completely unhelpful, because they all turn around why feature X sucks in language Y, or that claim language Y doesn't have X, although in fact it does. I also know exactly why I prefer Python, but that's also subjective, and wouldn't help anybody choosing, as they might not have the same tastes in development as I do.It would therefore be interesting to list the differences, objectively. So no ""Python's lambdas sucks"". Instead explain what Ruby's lambdas can do that Python's can't. No subjectivity. Example code is good!Don't have several differences in one answer, please. And vote up the ones you know are correct, and down those you know are incorrect (or are subjective). Also, differences in syntax is not interesting. We know Python does with indentation what Ruby does with brackets and ends, and that @ is called self in Python.UPDATE: This is now a community wiki, so we can add the big differences here.Ruby has a class reference in the class bodyIn Ruby you have a reference to the class (self) already in the class body. In Python you don't have a reference to the class until after the class construction is finished.An example: self in this case is the class, and this code would print out ""Kaka"". There is no way to print out the class name or in other ways access the class from the class definition body in Python (outside method definitions).All classes are mutable in RubyThis lets you develop extensions to core classes. Here's an example of a rails extension: Python (imagine there were no ''.startswith method): You could use it on any sequence (not just strings). In order to use it you should import it explicitly e.g., from some_module import starts_with.Ruby has Perl-like scripting featuresRuby has first class regexps, $-variables, the awk/perl line by line input loop and other features that make it more suited to writing small shell scripts that munge text files or act as glue code for other programs.Ruby has first class continuationsThanks to the callcc statement. In Python you can create continuations by various techniques, but there is no support built in to the language.Ruby has blocksWith the ""do"" statement you can create a multi-line anonymous function in Ruby, which will be passed in as an argument into the method in front of do, and called from there. In Python you would instead do this either by passing a method or with generators.Ruby: Python (Ruby blocks correspond to different constructs in Python): Or Or Interestingly, the convenience statement in Ruby for calling a block is called ""yield"", which in Python will create a generator.Ruby: Python: Although the principles are different, the result is strikingly similar.Ruby supports functional style (pipe-like) programming more easily Python: Python has built-in generators (which are used like Ruby blocks, as noted above)Python has support for generators in the language. In Ruby 1.8 you can use the generator module which uses continuations to create a generator from a block. Or, you could just use a block/proc/lambda! Moreover, in Ruby 1.9 Fibers are, and can be used as, generators, and the Enumerator class is a built-in generator 4docs.python.org has this generator example: Contrast this with the above block examples.Python has flexible name space handlingIn Ruby, when you import a file with require, all the things defined in that file will end up in your global namespace. This causes namespace pollution. The solution to that is Rubys modules. But if you create a namespace with a module, then you have to use that namespace to access the contained classes.In Python, the file is a module, and you can import its contained names with from themodule import *, thereby polluting the namespace if you want. But you can also import just selected names with from themodule import aname, another or you can simply import themodule and then access the names with themodule.aname. If you want more levels in your namespace you can have packages, which are directories with modules and an __init__.py file.Python has docstringsDocstrings are strings that are attached to modules, functions and methods and can beintrospected at runtime. This helps for creating such things as the help command andautomatic documentation. Ruby's equivalent are similar to javadocs, and located above the method instead of within it. They can be retrieved at runtime from the files by using 1.9's Method#source_location example usePython has multiple inheritanceRuby does not (""on purpose"" -- see Ruby's website, see here how it's done in Ruby). It does reuse the module concept as a type of abstract classes.Python has list/dict comprehensionsPython: Ruby: Python: Ruby: Python 2.7+: Ruby: Python has decoratorsThings similar to decorators can also be created in Ruby, and it can also be argued that they aren't as necessary as in Python.Syntax differencesRuby requires ""end"" or ""}"" to close all of its scopes, while Python uses white-space only.

Is there a consensus about an ideal test framework for Ruby 1.9.x?," A two-parter with a quick intro. Intro: I'm coming to Ruby from Perl, and I'm a bit lost among the test framework choices. I understand that there is probably no single, all-around best choice, but I can't even get a clear picture of the playing field.So, first, MiniTest or Test::Unit? I just realized that 1.9.1 defaults to MiniTest now. I hadn't noticed since all the older Test::Unit tutorials still work fine. If you require test/unit, you actually get MiniTest as a Test::Unit emulator (!). My initial thought was to go with the default choice of MiniTest (once I knew it was there), but even very recent books don't seem interested in teaching it. Ruby Best Practices says ""There are significant differences"" between the two, but he chooses not to deal with them. He also runs all his tests via Test::Unit (plus some custom add-ons). The new Pickaxe also has very little about MiniTest per se, and in the chapter on testing they also use the Test::Unit emulation version of MiniTest. To clarify my first question then: is MiniTest a poor first option? Should I default to using the Test::Unit emulator?Second, beyond the built-in options, there are Rspec, Cucumber & company for behavior driven tests. Is the community tilting strongly towards this style and this framework? Should I just start with Rspec?I will play a bit with all three, but I'm curious to hear what kind of consensus (if any) is forming around testing in Ruby 1.9.(A quick follow-up, as a reminder to myself and for anyone interested. See this link for a useful overview of the different invocations for Test::Unit and MiniTest in the various Rubies 1.8 to 1.9.1.) <code> ",Is there a consensus about test frameworks for Ruby 1.9.x?

Ruby: how can I copy this global variable?," (Follow-up to my earlier question, Ruby: how can I copy a variable without pointing to the same object?)I'm writing a simple Ruby program to make some substitutions in an .svg file. The first step is to pull information from the file and put it in an array. In order to keep from reading the file from disk every time this function is called, I'm trying to use the memoize design pattern - use a cached result on every call after the first one.To do this, I'm using a global variable, defined just before the function. But even though I .dup that variable to a local one before returning the local variable, the function that calls this one is still modifying the global variable.Here is my actual code: Two questions (answer either or both):Why do other functions, which take in and modify the value returned here, also affect the global variable, even though I used .dup to copy it?I'm new to Ruby and I'm sure this isn't the most Rubyesque way to do this (and I don't like global variables, anyway). Can you suggest a better strategy? <code>  #memoize to keep from having to read original file on each pass$svg_filedata_cache = [] #the global variabledef svg_filedata(filename) if $svg_filedata_cache.empty?

How to best create a random float in a range between to floats," I know that I can generate random floats with rand(max). I tried to generate a float in a range, this shouldn't be hard.

Usage of exceptions in Ruby - best practices," I am reading Agile Web Development with Rails (4th ed.) and I have found the following code Since I am a Java developer, my understanding of that part of code is more or less the following: That what strikes me is that the exception handling is used to control normal application flow (lack of Cart is perfectly normal behaviour when user visits Depot application for the first time).If one takes any Java book, they say that this is a very bad thing to do - and for a good reason: error handling shouldn't be used as a replacement for control statements, it's kind of misleading for those who read code.Is there any good reason why such a practice is justified in Ruby (Rails)? Is this a common practice in Ruby? <code>  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base protect_from_forgery private def current_cart Cart.find(session[:cart_id]) rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound cart = Cart.create session[:cart_id] = cart.id cart endend private Cart currentCard(){ try{ return CartManager.get_cart_from_session(cartId) }catch(RecordNotFoundEx e){ Cart c = CartManager.create_cart_and_add_to_session(new Cart()) return c; }}",Is it good practice to use exceptions for control flow in Ruby or Ruby on Rails?

Simple Question: Converting a custom object into JSON using JSON gem - Ruby," I am learning how to parse and generate JSON with the JSON gem. I am easily able to create a hash of data and generate that into JSON; however, I am having a brain fart when it comes to taking a instance of a class (such as a Person instance) and putting all of its instance variables inside a hash to be converted into JSON.This is the example I am having trouble with: I want to create a .to_json method so that I can take a person object and have all of its instance variables converted into JSON. What I think I need to do is take all of the Person's instance variables, put them in a hash then call JSON.generate(hash). I am having a brain fart on how to do that right now. So can someone help me complete the to_json method, or perhaps suggest a better way of implementing it? Thanks! <code>  require ""json""class Person def initialize(name, age, address) @name = name @age = age @address = address end def to_json endendp = Person.new('John Doe', 46, ""123 Elm Street"")p.to_json",Converting a custom object into JSON using JSON gem

Differences between Proc and Lambda in Ruby," Ruby has differences between Procs created via Proc.new and lambda (or the ->() operator in 1.9).

Why are Ruby method calls particularly slow?," I'm trying to read about Ruby performance, and came across this SO thread, where one of the answers mentions that ""method calls, one of the most common operations in Ruby, are particularly slow.""Another thread mentions that ""It does ""late lookup"" for methods, to allow for flexibility. This slows it down quite a bit. It also has to remember names per context to allow for eval, so its frames and method calls are slower.""Can someone explain in more detail why Ruby method calls are particularly slow, and elaborate on the second thread? I'm not totally sure what late lookup is or why it's slow, and I don't know what names per context means or how it relates to frames and method calls.My (possibly incorrect) understanding is that since methods can be added or modified at runtime, the Ruby interpreter can never ""remember"" how to run a particular method, so it has to lookup the method every time while the program is running, and this is what is meant by method calls being slow. But corrections and more technical explanations would be great. <code> ",Why are Ruby method calls particularly slow (in comparison to other languages)?

Better String#hash based only on the string's content.," GOAL: Map every URL handled by a server to 0, 1, 2, or 3, distributing as uniformly as possible.While the documentation for ruby's String#hash method says it will ""return a hash based on the strings length and content,"" this clearly isn't the whole story. A given string's hash is not consistent across invocations of the interpreter: This means a particular string's hash value may differ across, say, servers. Rails uses String#hash internally to map a URL path to one of four asset hosts (if the app's asset_host is so configured), but this feature is a lot less efficient than it could be because of the cross-machine inconsistencies; different servers may map the same URL to different asset hosts, reducing the effectiveness of caches, clouding skies, cooling cups of tea prematurely, besmirching the reputations of otherwise fine programmers.Can you suggest an alternate hash function that could effectively and speedily distribute hashes across a typical app's URL space, preferably one that produces a Fixnum since, in the end, I'll want to map it into one of four asset hosts? <code>  $ irbruby-1.9.2-p180 :001 > ""foo"".hash => 360517580588231756 ruby-1.9.2-p180 :002 > ^D$ irbruby-1.9.2-p180 :001 > ""foo"".hash => -2716152678666510148 ",Consistent String#hash based only on the string's content

Rails app as an LDAP server?," I'm working on an in-house Rails app, which is (among other things) a CRM app so it contains names, addresses etc., for customers and other contacts.A neat feature would to allow these contacts to be fetched/searched over by clients such as email programs and address book apps (i.e. just simple read-only access).The idea would be to use LDAP or CardDAV for this, but I haven't been able to much (recent) info on how to achieve it.For CardDAV, I've found basically nothing.For LDAP, I've found plenty of LDAP client gems and plugins, but only a few LDAP server implementations. What I've found so far is the plain Ruby LDAP server and LDAP-ActiveRecord-gateway, which is built on top of the former.The latter sounds like it'd fit the ticket, but it explicitly says ""Deprecated without replacement"" (in June of this year). It might still work, but I can't say I'm too keen on using it, now that it's been abandoned.So I was wondering if there's anything more recent out there? Is there some automagical gem or plugin I can use? Or some clues, hints, or tutorials I can dig into? While I'm not above writing everything myself, I'd rather avoid that. <code> ",Rails app as an LDAP or CardDAV server?

(Ruby) Instance variable still references after 'dup'," I have an object of a class, and I want to duplicate it with dup. One of the instance variables is an array, and it seems to be referencing it. I thought dup actually created a DUPLICATE.Here's my IRB session: I would expect a to be unchanged, because dup creates a whole new variable, not reference.

Iterate over an deeply nested level of hashes in Ruby," So I have a hash, and for each level of the hash, I want to store its key and value. The problem is, a value can be another hash array. Furthermore, that hash can contain key value pairs where the value is again another hash array, etc, etc. Also, I won't know how deeply nested each hash will be. To give an example: ..And so on. What I want to do is save each key, value pair and the id of its parent. I figure this will probably be done recursively, I'm just unsure how because I'm unfamiliar with recursive functions. I know how to iterate through the data normally: And so I'm guessing the recursive call will be something like this: This is untested, and I'm still unsure how to incorporate saving the parent ids regardless. <code>  { :key1 => 'value1', :key2 => 'value2', :key3 => { :key4 => 'value4', :key5 => 'value5' }, :key6 => { :key7 => 'value7', :key8 => { :key9 => 'value9' } } } myHash.each {|key, value| ...Do something with the key and value ... } def save_pair (myHash) myHash.each {|key, value| if(value.class != Hash) ?

In fact, it seems like it never enters the s.stream do.. block. Note that this is a GZip encoded stream.

Where and how is the _ (underscore) variable specified in Ruby?," Most are aware of _s special meaning in IRB as a holder for last return value, but that is not what I'm asking about here.Instead, Im asking about _ when used as a variable name in plain-old-Ruby-code. Here it appears to have special behavior, akin to a don't care variable ( la Prolog). Here are some useful examples illustrating its unique behavior: These were all run in Ruby directly (with putss added in)not IRBto avoid conflicting with its additional functionality.This is all a result of my own experimentation though, as I cannot find any documentation on this behavior anywhere (admittedly it's not the easiest thing to search for). Ultimately, I'm curious how all of this works internally so I can better understand exactly what is special about _. So Im asking for references to documentation, and, preferably, the Ruby source code (and perhaps RubySpec) that reveal how _ behaves in Ruby.Note: most of this arose out of this discussion with @Niklas B. <code>  lambda { |x, x| 42 } # SyntaxError: duplicated argument namelambda { |_, _| 42 }.call(4, 2) # => 42lambda { |_, _| 42 }.call(_, _) # NameError: undefined local variable or method `_'lambda { |_| _ + 1 }.call(42) # => 43lambda { |_, _| _ }.call(4, 2) # 1.8.7: => 2 # 1.9.3: => 4_ = 42_ * 100 # => 4200_, _ = 4, 2; _ # => 2",Where and how is the _ (underscore) variable specified?

What is the differnce between '..' and '...'?," I've just started learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails and came across validation code that uses ranges: At first I thought the difference was in the inclusion of endpoints, but in the API docs I looked into, it didn't seem to matter whether it was .. or ...: it always included the endpoints.However, I did some testing in irb and it seemed to indicate that .. includes both endpoints, while ... only included the lower bound but not the upper one. Is this correct? <code>  validates_inclusion_of :age, :in => 21..99validates_exclusion_of :age, :in => 0...21, :message => ""Sorry, you must be over 21""",Difference between '..'

Writing tests with RSpec for Redis," I have a model class that caches data in redis. The first time I call a method on the model, it computes a JSON/Hash value and stores it in Redis.

Why does Process.setsid require root privileges?," In Ruby, a call to Process.setsid fails with ""Operation not permitted"" error if it's run as non-superuser. Try: Or, it fails with the same error if I change the uid or the process using Process.uid= method.

Ruby: Official expansion of ||= conditional assignment operator," I want to emphasize I am looking for the actual way the ||= operator is expanded by the Ruby 1.9.3 interpreter, not how it appears to be expanded based on its behavior. What I'm really hoping for is someone who has grokked the actual interpreter source, a task which I sadly am probably not up to. The only resource I have found that appears to examine this question is out of date: ""A short-circuit (||=) edge case"".The resource I mentioned above seems to suggest that the ""official"" expansion of x ||= y to x = x || y was either inaccurate or buggy in interpreter versions prior to 1.9. In any case, the edge case indicated seems to have been smoothed out. The resource above claims that x || x = y or x or x = y are ""more accurate"". Neither of those, however, is correct, because they don't work when x is a previously undeclared global variable: So in 1.9.3, at least, the x = x || y expansion appears to be correct, as far as these examples are concerned. However, to reiterate my original point, I would really like to see some truly authoritative source resolve this question, well, authoritatively rather than anecdotally as I (and others) have done. <code>  [11:04:18][****@asha:~]$ irb1.9.3-p194 :001 > a || a = 3 NameError: undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object1.9.3-p194 :002 > b or b = 3 NameError: undefined local variable or method `b' for main:Object1.9.3-p194 :003 > c = c || 3 => 3 ",Official expansion of ||= conditional assignment operator

If I use CSV.parse with headers set to true, then it always makes the first row be headers no matter what.

I've already read through this and the source code it provides on each method - http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html <code>  NoMethodError: undefined method `encode' for nil:NilClass begin CSV.table(csv_file_path)rescue # Add error to log or something.end",Ruby 1.9.3 - How does CSV.table know if no headers are in a CSV file?
2 Namespaces of activeadmin," I'm trying to install activeadmin with two namespaces for the past 4 hours and am having no luck.I want two namespaces. ""admin"" and ""admin_unit"".I would assume that I would have the app/admin and app/admin_unit directories.For the admin namespace, I would like to use the default devise authentication, and for the ""admin_unit"" namespace, I have a current_user method that I need to use.I've tried wrapping all the config in the active_admin config with namespaces, and i've tried manually creating the files etc. but every time I have some problem.Activeadmin has changed so much in the past year, I'm affraid half of the instructions i've seen are outdated. And none of them are complete. The documentation is only partially there on the namespacing.Does anyone have some step by step instructions on installing these two namespaces from start to finish? I would be very appreciative for some help on this!EDITWhen I go to start server (or in this case im trying to rake routes), I get this error: dashboard.rb has this in it: I've also tried with no namespace: FYI I added a ""active_admin"" directory, and put both namespaced directories in there. I added both to the loadpaths (thanks for that).Does this error have anything to do with the new dashboard pages? I am going to look into how those work next.Thanks guys! Thanks for your work Gregg, I have used AA on dozens of apps now and love it!EDIT FIXOk, on the last issue, I found that taking the two activeadmin namespaced directories out of the ""active_admin"" directory that I created fixed the problem. Not sure what that wouldn't work... but oh well, i've spent enough cycles on this issue, and am ready to move on.Hope that helps someone else.. <code>  Expected /app/active_admin/admin/dashboard.rb to define Admin::Dashboard (LoadError) ActiveAdmin.register_page ""My Page"", :namespace => :admin do content do para ""Hello World"" endend ActiveAdmin.register_page ""My Page"" do content do para ""Hello World"" endend",Two Namespaces of activeadmin

Greedy matching multiple groups using regex," I would like to grab the contents of any value between pairs of <tag></tag> tags. The regex I have come up with is/<tag>(.*)</tag>/mThough, it appears to be greedy and is capturing everything within the enclosed parentheses up until the very last </tag>. I would like it to be as lazy as possible so that everytime it sees a closing tag, it will treat that as a match group and start over.How can I write the regex so that I will be able to get multiple matches in the given scenario?I have included a sample of what I am describing in the following linkhttp://rubular.com/r/JW5M3rnqIENote: This is not XML, nor is it really based on any existing standard format.

Ruby's `begin ... end` without `rescue` used as a code block," I occasionally see begin...end blocks used in ruby without any rescue, else, ensure, etc. statements in between. For example: The coder's intent, it seems, is to use the begin...end block just for its block-grouping quality (as if begin were do). Personally I think this usage kind of violates the principle of least surprise (begin implies exception-handling to me).Are there any unintended consequences of using begin...end in this way? Do begin...end blocks have any semantic differences (maybe in exception-handling?) that make this usage dangerous? Ruby's syntax is unbelievably subtle, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were weird gotchas lying in wait here. <code>  foo = begin whatever = 3 ""great"" 42end",Are there unintended consequences of Ruby's `begin ... end` without `rescue` used as a code block?

ruby: net-ssh timeout for execution," In my application I want to terminate the exec! command of my SSH connection after a specified amount of time.I found the :timeout for the Net::SSH.start command but following the documentation this is only for the initial connection. Is there something equivalent for the exec command? My first guess would be not using exec! as this will wait until the command is finished but using exec and surround the call with a loop that checks the execution status with every iteration and fails after the given amount of time.Something like this, if I understood the documentation correctly: However this seems dirty to me. I expect something like server.exec(""some command"" { :timeout=>60}). Maybe there is some built in function for achieving this functionality? <code>  server = NET::SSH.start(...)server.exec(""some command"")start_time = Time.nowterminate_calculation = falsetrap(""TIME"") { terminate_calculation = ((Time.now - start_time) > 60) }ssh.loop(0.1) { not terminate_calculation }",Net-ssh timeout for execution?

Fragment caching in Rails 4 with personalised data," My app (Rails 4) allows users to vote on posts.

Capistrano deploy:migrate runs all migrations every time," So, I'm diddling around with rails (ruby 1.9.3p392, rails 3.2, sqlite3 db) and I'm trying to deploy the ubiquitous blog tutorial code to a ""production"" server (apache, passenger, ubuntu). My deploy.rb looks like this: Now, I am sure that must look like a big hot mess to those who know what they are doing with capistrano, but I am an utter rube. In the end, despite my inadequacies, the deploy seems to work, because when I run the following my app is up and running and, just because I can, I add a few rows to a table in the db via the web ui that was created for me by rails. Now, I get bold and create a migration, adding a column to a table. I push my changes to git. To my horror, when I run ALL the migrations are run, which recreates the tables, thus destroying all my data. I have repeated this painful process several times. My schema_migrations table looks like this: What am I missing here? UPDATE: I recently gave @TheMahrvin's suggestion regarding running deploy:migrations at the command line and removing it from the deploy.rb. It didn't work... once again, all migrations were run. My muse must have whispered something in my ear, because I decided to try running db:migrate on the server itself. I was astonished to see this output after running just ""rake"": Only the last migrations should be pending. So, perhaps this isn't a problem with Capistrano at all (I've updated the title of this question to reflect that). So, why are the previous migrations still being flagged as pending? I know they were run in the past, both because I saw them in the output and verified the db schema after they ran.UPDATE #2: Setup another migration and ssh'd into the server and cd'd my way to the ""current"" directory, which if I understand capistrano at all (fat chance) is where the current files are. Running got me: I can't help feeling that there is something profoundly wrong with what I am trying to do. <code>  require 'bundler/capistrano'require 'rvm/capistrano'load 'deploy/assets'set :rvm_ruby_string, ENV['GEM_HOME'].gsub(/.*\//,"""")set :rvm_type, :userset :user, 'blah'set :application, 'railsTest'set :domain, 'www.blah.com'set :applicationdir, ""/home/sean/public/blah.com/public""set :scm, 'git'set :repository, ""ssh://blah@1.1.1.1/home/blah/public/bla.com/public/capDep.git""#set :git_enable_submodules, 1 # if you have vendored railsset :branch, 'master'set :git_shallow_clone, 1set :scm_verbose, trueset :use_sudo, false# roles (servers)role :web, domainrole :app, domainrole :db, domain, :primary => true# deploy configset :deploy_to, applicationdirset :deploy_via, :exportset :migrate_target, :latest# additional settingsdefault_run_options[:pty] = true # Forgo errors when deploying from windows#ssh_options[:keys] = %w(/home/blah/.ssh/id_rsa)ssh_options[:forward_agent] = true# if you want to clean up old releases on each deploy uncomment this:# If you are using Passenger mod_rails uncomment this:namespace :deploy do task :start do ; end task :stop do ; end task :restart, :roles => :app, :except => { :no_release => true } do run ""#{try_sudo} touch #{File.join(current_path,'tmp','restart.txt')}"" endend#after ""deploy:update_code"", ""deploy:migrate"" cap deploy:setupcap deploy cap deploy 2013062021000420130620220229201306282133312013062821494620130628223002 20130717230110 CreateHighScores 20130717230342 CreateGames 20130717231041 AddGameTypeToGame 20130717233707 AddGamePublisherToGame 20130717234124 AddGameRatingToGame 20130731210558 AddGameMechanicToGame bundle exec rake db:migrate:status Status Migration ID Migration Name-------------------------------------------------- down 20130717230110 Create high scores down 20130717230342 Create games down 20130717231041 Add game type to game down 20130717233707 Add game publisher to game down 20130717234124 Add game rating to game down 20130731210558 Add game mechanic to game down 20130731212454 Add publish year to game down 20130731214515 Add game rank to game down 20130731214928 Add game abbr to game down 20130731215749 Add crazy field to game",Capistrano deploy:migrate and db:migrate run all migrations every time
How to pass parameters trough the associations chain in FactoryGirl," By default, FactoryGirl calls the factories of associations to create them. I can pass a association for a factory as a parameter. But how can I passa an object which should be used deep in the associations chain?For example:I have a Post, which has a PostsManager, which has an Account, which belongs to the current_user.When I do a Factory(:post) it creates an PostsManager, which creates an Account, which doesn't belongs to the (stubed) current_user.So, in specs that use the Post factory I have to do: What I would like to do is call the factory with Factory(:post, user: current_user), and then pass current_user all the way through the associations to the Account factory. Is there a way to do it so? <code>  account = Factory(:account, user: current_user)post_manager = Factory(:post_manager, account: account)post = Factory(:post, post_manager: post_manager)",How to pass parameters through the associations chain in FactoryGirl

Rails gem for complex password rules?," I need to implement password security with various flexible requirements. The requirements are essentially taken from the Sans password policy: Strong passwords have the following characteristics: Contain at least three of the five following character classes: Lower case characters Upper case characters Numbers Punctuation Special characters (e.g. @#$%^&*()_+|~-=`{}[]:"";'<>/ etc) Contain at least fifteen alphanumeric characters. There are also requirements of not allowing the users email address to appear in the password.Ideally, I would like a gem that would handle this - it would be more widely tested and used, and we would be less likely to have bugs.If no gem covers this, then what is the best and most-hardened method to handle these requirements? Ideally we would be able to say that we are not only safe, but safe because we have an industry standard implementation.The gems I have found so far are:Devise Security Extensions, which has a very simple regex for checking that there is uppercase, lowercase, and digitsandStrong Password, which looks to just provide an entropy check to let the user know if their password is strong.(We are using Rails 3.2.17 and Ruby 1.9.3, but are planning on moving to Rails 4 and Ruby 2 soon, so newer solutions are also welcome). <code> ",Best flexible rails password security implementation

Rails Sass: variables arenot passed with @import," I have a rails project which uses twitter bootstrap and sass. The scss files are structured into folders so I havea better overview. Now I want to define a file for global variables which contains my colors etc. and pass those values down to other files so I have less redundant code. While all code is properly imported and applied,variables don't work.Here is the current setup:stylesheets/application.css.scss I'm not using the =require method as it does not allow the use of variables and mixins (which I'd like to use).I also use a main.scss which contains all the imports. stylesheets/main.scss The helpers/globals.scss contains the color definitions: stylesheets/helpers/globals.scss The file component/tables.scss is supposed to use that variable. According to most information on the web and the official SASS-guide this should work as I declared the variable and import the according file before the file that uses it. Certainly, the variable is not found:Undefined variable: ""$background-light"".The whole procedure seems rather simple but I'm running out of ideas. Do I need to set something in my environment files or do I need to change my application.css.scss? Or might bootstrap interfere here?Thanks in advance for your help.  <code>  /* *= require_self *= require_tree *//*stylesheets/|| base/| | _reset.scss # Reset/normalize| | _typography.scss # Typography rules|| components/| | _buttons.scss # Buttons| | _messages.scss # Nachrichten| | _dropdown.scss # Dropdown|| helpers/| | _globals.scss # Sass Variables| | _functions.scss # Sass Functions| | _mixins.scss # Sass Mixins| | _helpers.scss # Class & placeholders helpers//more files omitted|| vendors/| | _bootstrap_and_overrides.css # Bootstrap| | _scaffolds.scss # Bootstrap||` main.scss # primary Sass file*/ @import ""bootstrap-sprockets"";@import ""bootstrap"";@import ""helpers/globals"";@import ""base/normalize"";@import ""base/grid"";@import ""base/typography"";@import ""components/buttons"";@import ""components/tables"";//other files omitted $background-light : #4e4d4a; .table-striped > tbody > tr:nth-child(2n+1) > { tr, td, th { background-color: $background-light; }}",Rails Sass: variables are not passed with @import
Trying to set up Amazon's S3 bucket," I'm following Hartl's railstutorial.org and have arrived at 11.4.4: Image upload in production. What I've done:Signed up for Amazon Web ServicesIn Amazon Identity and Access Management I created a user. The user was created succesfully.In Amazon S3 I created a new bucket. Set permissions on the new bucket:Permissions:The tutorial instructs to ""grant read and write permission to the user created in the previous step"". However, under 'Permissons' for the bucket the new user's name is not mentioned. I could only choose between Everyone, Authenticated users, Log delivery, Me, and a username Amazon seems to have created itself from my name + a number. I have tried it by selecting Authenticated users and checked the boxes for Upload/Delete and View permissions (and not selecting List and Edit permissions). I also tried it by selecting Everyone and checked all the four boxes. The results were the same.I implemented in my Rails application following the instructions of the tutorial (I don't belief anything wen't wrong there, so I haven't included those steps here to not make it too long).The initializer carrier_wave.rb is set to the code below. I've added region: 'eu-west-1' to the initializer (an idea I got from here) to get rid of the message connecting to the matching region will be more performant. It worked in development and I pushed to Heroku.Error:When using the uploader in production to upload an image, I get the error We're sorry, but something went wrong. The Heroku server log says: What have I done wrong? I seems to have something to do with the permissions?Update:The cause turned out to be the policies granted to the user. If I grant the user standard AmazonS3FullAccess then it works. It doesn't work with just AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess, since then the user can't save a new image. In my application the user basically only needs 2 rights: upload its own avatar image and read the avatar image. Would it be safe to use AmazonS3FullAccess or should I write my own custom policy?I tried the custom policy below, which should give the application read and write rights (adopted from here) but that still generated the 403 Forbidden error. <code>  if Rails.env.production?

"Can ruby hashes be included in sass and coffeescript, allowing data to be shared?"," I am wondering if a ruby hash can be shared between Sass and CoffeeScript with a minimum of fuss.I've looked around for an answer to this but found nothing conclusive. Sources, such as the documentation for Sass, talk about how to link files of the same type and how to manipulate data structures within the language, but don't touch on whether data can be imported from elsewhere, or whether ruby code can be interpreted in someway - the only similar thing I can think of is compass using a .rb file for it's config.My instinct suggests this is (or should) be possible, both languages are Ruby-like and capable of interpreting hashes.As this is a practical problem I've faced several times (DRYing up pre-processed front end code, but also providing the same values for back-end processing, such as generating an SVG in an HTML template) but never solved in a really clean way I would accept a solution that involved using Rails.Please note, I am quite specific about this relating to the pre-compilation stage of front end asset production, namely Sass and CoffeeScript. Answers which involve CSS, JavaScript or require a browser are not what I'm looking for.Extra bitsI've decided to add an example, here are three definitions of the same data as key value pairs:Ruby Sass Map CoffeeScript Coffeescript and Ruby hash definitions are identical, Sass is very close ... if this can work then colours (or any other variable) could be defined in one place then used throughout the front and back end by any code. <code>  colours = { brandBackground: '#f00', brandForeground: '#00f', brandText: '#0f0' }colours[:brandBackground] $colours: ( brandBackground: '#f00', brandForeground: '#00f', brandText: '#0f0' )map-get($colours, brandBackground) colours = { brandBackground: '#f00', brandForeground: '#00f', brandText: '#0f0' }colours.brandBackground","Can Ruby hashes be included in Sass and CoffeeScript, allowing data to be shared?"

AWS Elastic Beanstalk - Cannot `Clone With Latest Platform` or `eb upgrade` from Ruby 2.1 to Ruby 2.2," AWS Elastic Beanstalk - Cannot Clone With Latest Platform or eb upgrade from Ruby 2.1 to Ruby 2.2I've been smashing my head on this one. Back in May, AWS announced that their Ruby Elastic Environments now offer Ruby-2.2 (e.g. ruby-2.2-(passenger-standalone) or ruby-2.2-(puma)). I can't upgrade my existing ruby-2.1 environments to ruby-2.2. It appears I have to recreate them completely...that seems silly? Anyone else out there experiencing this? Am I just missing something simple?Extra InformationI've been gleefully using ruby-2.1-(passenger-standalone) for several months in my staging and production environments. Now I'd like to upgrade them to the latest ruby-2.2 platform. The AWS documentation says this is pretty trivial, in fact some of their documentation even appear to state that you can use an eb clone <env-name> --update. That flag doesn't exist in the EB CLI 3.4.5 that I'm using :( Additionally, the web console has a Clone with Latest Platform option menu item, yet it is disabled.It appears that all I can do to get to the latest Ruby-2.2 instances is to create a brand new environment from scratch. That's tremendously annoying.So here's what I've tried... Great, confirms I'm using Ruby 2.1. So let's try to upgrade: Okay, that's nice, so what about the platform itself: So now, here's my platform settings: So New environments will take advantage of the Ruby-2.2 editions.

Auto-Correct Line length in a library," I am working on a huge project and we have decided to make all code conform to 80 characters per line. It is a ruby based project with wrappers for C.

Aside from that, there were many other errors detected by Rubocop which I want to ignore for now.I am looking for the easiest way to auto-correct all the line length violations only, to satisfy the 80 character limit both in C and Ruby. <code>  rubocop --only LineLength",Auto-correct line lengths in a library

Array assign vs. append behavior in class method," The following behavior looks to me like the assign method is processing visited by value, whereas the append method is treating it as a reference: Can someone explain this behavior?This is not a question about whether Ruby supports pass by reference or pass by value, but rather about the example provided below, and why two methods that purportedly do the same thing exhibit different behaviors. <code>  class MyClass def assign(visited) visited += [""A""] end def append(visited) visited << ""A"" endendinstance = MyClass.newvisited = []instance.assign(visited)visited # => []instance.append(visited)visited # => [""A""]",Array assign vs. append behavior
Boolean logic for ENV variables, Since Rails ENV variables should only have string values it could be the problem to decide how to use ENV variable for use cases which need boolean logic. For example since ENV variable have a string value and it would always be truthy it wouldn't be too nice to do something like that: So there are at least 2 ways to accomplish things like above:Initialize variable with particular value and check it Or just initialize variable with any value and check if it was initialized (the code could be exactly as we wanted). The question is what option is more preferred and what pros and cons each of them could have? <code>  if ENV['MY_VARIABLE'] # do somethingelse # do something elseend if ENV['MY_VARIABLE'] == 'some string' # do somethingelsif ENV['MY_VARIABLE'] == 'some other string' # do something elseend if ENV['MY_VARIABLE'] # do somethingelse # do something elseend,Boolean logic with Rails ENV variables

Rails 5.1 System tests with RSpec," After watching a RailsConf video on ActionDispatch::systemTestCase, I was excited to incorporate it into my current app. Currently our test suite setup uses the following:rspecfactory_girlcapybara # for feature specsdatabase_cleaner # for feature specs, mostly for testing jsselenium-webdriver # for feature specscapybara-webkit # for feature specsIt was difficult to get the configuration working for our current setup, but we eventually got it working, thanks largely to an article by Avdi Grimm titled: Configuring database_cleaner with Rails, RSpec, Capybara, and Selenium.My hope was to use the built-in system tests of rails released in rails 5.1. Since rails now has system testing built in: all I would need to worry about configuring is the following:rspecfactory_girlAnd that is it because ActionDispatch::systemTestCase takes care of capybara, database_cleaner, and it is already configured for the selenium driver.For example: currently my feature specs are written like so (Capybara within the context of RSpec): So this is what a typical integration/feature/system spec might look like for a test suite configured with rspec, database_cleaner, factory_girl, and capybara. I would like to convert it over to using ActionDispatch::systemTestCase. However: I would like to use ActionDispatch::systemTestCase within the context of RSpec.The RailsConf video above shows how ActionDispatch::systemTestCase works within the context of rails' default test suite layout (ex: minitest with tests located in a test directory), but it did not discuss how to use ActionDispatch::systemTestCase within the context of RSpec. I could not find any resources on making rails' built-in system tests configurable with RSpec, including within the system testing section of the rails guides. Is this possible? <code>  #spec/features/blogs/creating_blogs_spec.rbrequire ""rails_helper""RSpec.feature ""Logged in User can create a blog"" do before do create(:logged_in_user) end scenario ""successfully"", js: true do ... endend ",Rails 5.1 Configuring Built-in System Tests with RSpec

Ransack exact match of array values," I have to perform a search on a database using ransack. A few columns in the database have data stored in serialized arrays. I want to match the exact data stored in the arrays with data sent by user to perform search (users' data are also arrays). For example, in database, one column has data as (c1, c2 are test cases): User searches for data (t1, t2, t3 are test cases): For case c1 with t1, t2, t4, it should return no match found.With t3, it should result with match found.For case c2 with t1, t2, t3, it should return no match found.With t4, it return `match found.I found postgres_ext gem, but I cannot make it work. Can anyone suggest how I can do this or suggest any alternative method for search like this? Any alternative solution is also welcome. <code>  c1.column_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]c2.column_data = [] t1.user_data = [1]t2.user_data = [1, 3]t3.user_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]t4.user_data = []",Ransack exact match with array values
